Racism is the other virus sweeping America during this pandemic,"Morita, Julie",Chicago Tribune,2020-04-21,"My parents have seen it all.
As Japanese Americans, they experienced as children the pain of internment during World War II, one of the terrible scars in our country's past that stemmed from fear, hate
and racism. They lived through the horrors of 9/11 and witnessed the discrimination against Muslims in the wake of those attacks. With the coronavirus pandemic today, they
are hearing the all-too-familiar vitriol toward Asian Americans being spewed from the dark and angry corners of social media and beyond.
Although they remained stoic and largely reserved in the decades that followed internment, their quiet resilience changed dramatically after 9/11. They would begin to speak
out against the injustices of that time, becoming activists in their own right.
Now, as a Chicagoan who for nearly two decades worked for the Chicago Department of Public Health, I can't remain silent as I witness the bigotry that has percolated in
Chicago and across the country in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic that began in Wuhan, China. Racism has its own virulence that is bad for the nation's soul and,
as research has shown, is actually bad for the nation's health.
My family's path to the Midwest began in those internment camps. In order to leave, family members secured employment in Chicago. Despite prejudice and fear among many
Chicago businesses and their employees, my grandparents and parents were given opportunities at Wrap-on Tools and Edgewater Beach Hotel. My grandparents became
valuable, dependable and loyal employees and challenged their children to excel too.
Given a chance, my parents thrived, both finishing high school and going on to college. My dad joined the Army and then went to dental school on the GI Bill. My mom became
a high school art teacher. They were resilient and didn't dwell on the past, raising their children with strong values, including sacrifice and service to others. My parents'
influence is a key reason I chose my career path in public health and now work at a foundation that advocates for a fair and just opportunity for everyone in America.
But my parents were spurred to action after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. As fear, discrimination and violence toward Muslims increased, they spoke out against these injustices. In
recent years, they raised their voices again as federal policies became more punitive and restrictive for immigrants and refugees. Normally soft-spoken and unassuming, my
parents shared their experiences in panel discussions, newsletters and as featured guests of a multimedia exhibit depicting the internment of Japanese Americans, ""Then They
Came for Me.""
The resilience I learned from them has buoyed me and my three brothers, as we too have experienced racism, including crude and hateful remarks. My parents taught us to
turn the other cheek, to be confident in our identity and values, no matter the situation.
Now, I must speak out in the face of new attacks on Asian Americans. A preliminary analysis, in fact, examined nearly 1 million tweets focused on racial minorities between
November 2019 and March 2020 -- the period when the novel coronavirus went from outbreak to pandemic. The percentage of tweets involving negative speech against Asian
Americans increased 70% during that period while falling 4% for all other racial minority groups. (The research team was comprised of a group of doctors, including Gilbert Gee
from UCLA along with Thu Nguyen of UCSF, Shanise Criss of Furman University, Quyen Nguyen of the University of Maryland and David Chae of Tulane.)
This treatment of Asian Americans is immoral, but also dangerous to public health. Research shows that hateful speech and other actions against racial and ethnic minorities --
even seemingly small slights -- might make people sick, contributing to heart disease, respiratory illness and other chronic diseases. In an environment where people of any
race feel threatened, they might be less likely to seek treatment out of fear and distrust of our medical system. This is especially dangerous in the midst of a pandemic when we
should be lowering barriers to care, not raising them.
During and after this pandemic, we must treat Asian Americans not as enemies, but as fellow victims of this insidious virus that does not distinguish by place, race, age or
gender. This is the time to support our neighbors, not turn on them. These are the values that define our nation.
John of the Cross, a 16th century Catholic priest and mystic, wrote that ""In the evening of our lives we will be judged only by how we have loved."" As a nation, we will be
judged now by how we treat people in need. That's a lesson I learned from my parents, and a value I carry proudly in my work and everyday life.
In this time of the novel coronavirus, we are all in need of understanding, compassion and love. This is good for the soul, and for the health of our nation.

Asian Americans made to 'feel ... as if we are the virus' [Corrected 03/26/2020],"Yin, Alice",Chicago Tribune,2020-03-26,"Ro Nguyen thought it would play out differently.
The 30-year-old had just watched a movie at a Streeterville cinema with a friend on March 12 and was strolling down East Grand Avenue around 8 p.m., the two of them
marveling at the deserted streets.
As they headed toward the Red Line station, Nguyen said a man walking nearby saw them and yelled out, ""F--- China!""
Then the man spat on Nguyen, he said. The saliva splattered on his jacket.
Nguyen, who is of Vietnamese and Filipino descent, had imagined this moment. Having read news stories about harassment and attacks against Asians as coronavirus cases
rose, he wondered if he would be next. If he was, he thought he would take a stand on behalf of himself and other Asians.
But as he wiped the saliva off with his sleeve, he and his friend -- of South Asian descent -- hurried away without a word to the assailant.
""In that instance, I was just kind of shocked, or dumbfounded, of what occurred,"" Nguyen said.
Nguyen worries that East Asians in the United States will face even more harassment and attacks as coronavirus cases continue to rise. He said he believes President Donald
Trump stoked such hate-filled reaction during a news briefing last week when he defended his use of ""Chinese virus.""
""It's not racist at all,"" Trump said. ""I think they probably would agree with it 100%. It comes from China."" He also said he was using the expression to fight back against Beijing
officials who were blaming the U.S. military for the introduction of the disease.
The World Health Organization has recommended people use coronavirus or COVID-19, stating that other characterizations spread negative stereotypes.
On Monday, Trump appeared to walk back his earlier position, using the word ""coronavirus"" and stressing it was important to ""totally protect our Asian American community.""
""Yes, it seems that there could be a little bit of nasty language toward the Asian Americans in our country,"" he admitted. ""I don't like that at all. These are incredible people,
they love our country and I'm not going to let it happen.""
But Nguyen fears it's too late. Since the president and other politicians first used the term, Nguyen and other Asians in Chicago said they have felt growing apprehension that
people take the president's comments as a license for racism.
Elsewhere in the U.S., reports of hate crimes have cropped up from New York to San Francisco, some caught on video and circulated through social media. In California's San
Fernando Valley, a 16-year-old was sent to the emergency room after being beat up and accused of having the coronavirus at his high school, CBS News reported.
""It's outrageous,"" said state Rep. Theresa Mah from the 2nd District, which includes Chicago's Chinatown. ""Chinese Americans and constituents of mine understand this is a
situation in which they could potentially be scapegoats for the uncertainty people feel.""
'History is repeating itself'
Mabel Menard was sitting alone at her favorite neighborhood tavern in Old Town earlier this month when she noticed an unfamiliar face.
A man, very intoxicated, made eye contact with her and said, ""Do you have the corona?""
Menard, a 58-year-old Chinese American, said she didn't think twice before quipping, ""I'm having a wine.""
The bar's staff kicked the man out.
""I kind of thought he was an idiot,"" Menard said. ""That's the kind of mentality that you walk around with, thinking that you're better than anybody else, and the way to make
you feel better is to be nasty to other people. I think that's pretty sad.""
Tuyet Anh, 20, said she was sitting alone on a Red Line train one day late in February, headed south from Lakeview to DePaul University, where she is a junior, when she noticed
two men whispering.
""Got to get our masks on,"" one of them said.
Tuyet Anh, who did not want her last name used, looked away. One of the men wondered aloud, ""Oh, do you think she heard us?""
""I felt at first just very shocked,"" Tuyet Anh said. ""Really? Someone would say that? But then processing it more, I just felt a little nervous and that feeling of being under
surveillance, almost.""
Tuyet Anh, who is of Vietnamese descent, has since been saddened to read social media comments from her fellow classmates using the terms ""Chinese virus"" and ""Wu flu.""
She wasn't surprised, given that the first phrase was picked up by Trump.
""It makes me and other Asian Americans feel as if we are the virus,"" Tuyet Anh said. ""We are labeled and demonized as this threat to white American safety.""
Menard, president of Chicago's chapter of the advocacy group OCA-Asian Pacific American Advocates, said the tense environment reminds her of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act
barring Chinese immigrants from entering the country, the first immigration law to exclude an ethnic group, as well as the World War II Japanese internment camps forcing
Japanese Americans into incarceration.
""History is repeating itself,"" Menard said. ""If we looked at the history of Asian Americans in the U.S., we've always been either held up as a model minority -- that despite the
discrimination, we're still doing well -- or we're demonized because when something like this happens, it's all our fault.""
Asian American organizations last week launched the #WashTheHate campaign on social media, highlighting stories of coronavirus-related racism. The Asian Pacific Policy and
Planning Council and Chinese for Affirmative Action groups also started collecting reports of incidents of hostility against Asians.
In less than a week, more than 400 reports surfaced, said the council's executive director, Manjusha Kulkarni.
But Chicago police say they have not seen an increase in hate crimes against people of Asian descent.
""There is absolutely no place in Chicago for hatred or bigotry of any kind,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. ""We strongly urge anyone who may be a victim of
threatening or harassing behavior to contact Chicago police, as we will investigate and work with our partners to prosecute these acts.""
Businesses hit hard
The last hour before Illinois' statewide stay-at-home order mandating the closure of nonessential stores, the Dongs were in their family-owned bonsai and restaurant supply
store Q Ideas at 1134 W. Argyle St.
Like many shops on the colorful street known as Little Vietnam, Q Ideas had its doors open on Saturday, ready for customers. But they did not come. ""Oh, my God, it's been
nothing,"" said Ellen Dong, 29.
Dong, who is Chinese and Vietnamese, wonders whether the rhetoric against China has curbed business on Argyle and in Chinatown. ""I'm really concerned that people are going
to lose their jobs.""
Though Chicagoans led efforts to draw customers through a restaurant crawl in Chinatown, business owners saw steep declines the past few months, compounded by the
governor's order to close all restaurants for dining in.
For the Dongs, this year has encapsulated the long-standing paradox of being Asian American: of both being invisible, blending in the background, and still being alien in the
eyes of others.
""Asian Americans are forgotten until -- and I don't know why -- until there's something to blame,"" Ellen Dong said. ""Then we remember them.""",7191
Trump alienating Asian Americans: Riling up his base seems to outweigh reaching minorities,"Ho, Sally",Chicago Tribune,2020-07-12,"Sonny Vinuya hasn't decided if he'll vote again for Donald Trump in the battleground state of Nevada.
The Filipino American businessman in Las Vegas is personally offended by the president's use of a racist slur at
recent reelection rallies, where he mocked China and the COVID-19 pandemic's origins in Asia. But most
important to Vinuya is the economy, which has also been sinking into a pandemic-triggered recession despite a
robust stimulus package.
Though it's tough for the registered Republican to swallow the racism against his own community, Vinuya said
he doesn't think Trump is trying to alienate Asian American voters when the president uses derogatory terms at
campaign events or continues to call COVID-19 the ""Chinese virus.""
The Pew Research Center recently declared Asian Americans to be the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group in
the U.S. electorate, but they are also arguably the least competitive voter block for Trump when considering
where they live and how they relate to the Republican Party.
In Nevada, where Vinuya lives, Asians make up more than 10% of voters in a state both Democrats and
Republicans will fight for in the fall.
With his anti-Asian rhetoric, Trump is making the calculation that he has more to gain with his loyal base of older white voters thrilled by his inflammatory statements than to lose among the Asian American community,
said Karthick Ramakrishnan, a public policy professor at the University of California, Riverside and founder of
AAPI Data, which tracks Asian Americans.
That's because Asian Americans largely vote in very blue districts and otherwise non-competitive states,
Ramakrishnan said. A third of all such voters live in California alone.
""Part of the reason we don't see very much outreach is because Asian Americans tend to live in non-competitive
states in presidential elections,"" Ramakrishnan said.
Trump's words have angered many Asian Americans and drawn condemnation from Trump's Democratic rival Joe
Biden and former President Barack Obama. Republicans have also denounced the racist slur, notably Kellyanne
Conway, a White House counselor who is married to an Asian American, George Conway, whose mother was
from the Philippines.
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the president's rhetoric, saying he's not being racist
but merely linking the virus to its place of origin. Trump in March also insisted that Asian Americans were
""amazing people"" and not at fault for spreading the virus.
Since the virus took hold of the U.S. in March, advocates have also reported a rise in anti-Asian aggression and
violence from people blaming them for the pandemic. A group called Stop AAPI Hate said on July 1 that it has
tracked 832 incidents of discrimination and harassment in California over the past 12 weeks.
Biden at a June 27 town hall for Asian American voters slammed Trump's ""dangerous theories"" as xenophobic.
""Words matter and the president's words matter even more,"" Biden said.
The number of Asian Americans aligning themselves with the Democratic party has increased over the past 20
years while support for the GOP has trended down. A different Pew analysis in 2018 showed Democrats held a
2-to-1 advantage among Asian American registered voters. The 27% who identified as or leaned Republican
represented a 6% drop since 1998.
For Trump, AAPI Data found nearly all major Asian American ethnic groups held an unfavorable view of the
president. The only exception was the 62% of Vietnamese surveyed in 2018 who said they held a favorable
impression of him. On the other end of the spectrum, just 14% of Japanese voters felt the same way.
In the top 10 states with the largest Asian American voting populations, Trump in 2016 won only Texas and
Florida. But the ultimate swing state in this year's election, Ramakrishnan said, is unlikely to be determined by
the 3.6% of Florida voters who are Asian American given how large the state is.
That means in smaller states like Nevada, the deeper concentration of eligible Asian American voters -- the
fourth-highest behind Hawaii, California and Washington state -- could potentially move the needle. About 11%
of Nevada's voters are Asian.
Trump lost the Silver State in 2016 to rival Democrat Hillary Clinton by just 2.4 percentage points, though
Nevada now leans more blue.
For Vinuya, who has been courted by the Trump campaign as the president of the Las Vegas Asian Chamber of
Commerce, he knows he could be one of the few Asian American voters nationally who can make a difference
for the president's reelection prospects.
Vinuya said he's expressed his concerns about the anti-Asian slur to Trump's team, especially as he's trying to
help his 600-plus members overcome the virus-related stigma and discrimination evident against Asian
American and Asian immigrant small business owners in Las Vegas.
""I gave them my two cents. That's pretty much it,"" Vinuya said. ""I don't want to waste my time on something
I cannot control.""",4980
"City leaders, groups rally against Asian hate [Corrected 03/29/2021]: Hundreds gathered in Chinatown latest in week of protests","Yin, Alice",Chicago Tribune,2021-03-28,"Hundreds of people huddled with signs reading ""#StopAsianHate"" on Saturday afternoon steps from Chinatown Square in Chicago's latest protest against anti-Asian racism after the shooting spree across Atlanta-area spas this month that left eight dead, six of them women of Asian descent. 
The 2 p.m. rally was led by the Chinatown Security Foundation and the Coalition for a Better Chinese American Community, with more than 65 other Asian American organizations in attendance, according to an event summary.
It follows other protests over the past week that also drew hundreds in Chicago to speak out against the recent surge of violence and racism targeting Asian Americans, including a Friday night vigil at Horner Park.
Julie Moy, an 18-year-old from McKinley Park, had brought her 15-year-old cousin to the outdoor mall in the plaza that morning when they noticed a sign advertising the rally plastered on a restaurant. They walked over to the tables set up on the other side of the ""Chinese in America"" mural and grabbed some posters.
""We decided to join because there aren't many rallies against Asian hate, and it just needs to be more of a thing,"" Moy said.
Her younger cousin Jason added, ""My side of the family is actually from Chinatown, so I feel like being Chinese is deeply rooted in who I am. I feel that it's important to show our support, especially since what happened to the people in Georgia.""
The March 16 massacre in Georgia deepened an old wound for the Asian American community already grappling with a year of fear following the coronavirus pandemic, which many felt caused them to be scapegoated. In recent months, there has also been a wave of reported violence against Asian Americans across the U.S., including an alleged attack last weekend in Chicago that remains under police investigation.
The rally began with an acknowledgment of three Asian American men who were killed in Chicago last year. They were Weizhong Xiong, 38, and Huayi Bian, 37, who both were fatally shot in a Chinatown parking lot in February 2020, and Shuai Guan, 33, who was killed in a shooting in Bridgeport last December. Their deaths came during a year of skyrocketing crime in the city.
Chris Huang, president of the Chinatown Security Foundation, discussed plans to add more security cameras to the neighborhood but said the United States's deep-rooted prejudice against Asians cannot be solved by that alone.
""This attitude of Asians being looked down on, taken advantage of, treated unfairly have been here since my grandfather came to work on the railroad in the early 1900s,"" Huang said.
Grace Chan McKibben, executive director of CBCAC, said Saturday's protest was part of a ""growing movement of Asian Americans demanding that our voices be heard."" The Georgia shootings have only ""heightened the nation's awareness of the racism and sexism that our community has been all too familiar with,"" she added.
AARP Illinois executive council member Nancy Chen led the crowd in a chant of ""enough is enough"" after sharing her personal fears as older Asian Americans face heightened vulnerability in the recent violence.
""I'm a 76-year-old grandmother,"" Chen said. ""I know exactly how our elderly folks in our community feel. ... We should not have to be worried about walking on the street in our neighborhood and worry about being attacked and killed.""
Nationwide, anti-Asian hate crime reports surged by 149% last year, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University's San Bernardino campus. That is despite a 7% drop overall in 2020 hate crime reports.
And a national coalition of Asian American organizations collected 3,795 reports on anti-Asian racism from March 2020 to February, finding almost 70% of them came from Asian women.
The organizers of the rally presented five demands: increase Chinatown safety; respond to anti-Asian hate crimes with timeliness and cultural sensitivity; create a website to report such attacks; pass an Illinois bill to mandate teaching Asian American history in public schools; and fund Asian American community organizations.
Illinois Department of Human Services Secretary Grace Hou, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle attended, as well as multiple lawmakers from Illinois' congressional delegation and statehouse.
Foxx, who in her remarks dinged former President Donald Trump for what she said was espousing ""white supremacy"" during the COVID-19 pandemic, noted her office's role in prosecuting suspects in the three homicides in Chinatown and Bridgeport.
""Though the pandemic has slowed down our court systems, it has not slowed down our quest for justice,"" Foxx said. ""Those cases are still pending. We will seek justice and accountability.""
Moy and Jason, the two cousins from McKinley Park and Chinatown who joined the rally, said the rally surprised them with the large crowds spilling onto the second floor of the mall and the racial diversity among its attendees.
""I wasn't really expecting this,"" Jason said. ""I feel like very proud and happy to see such a great turnout for the rally.""

"Atlanta shootings have left scars in Chicago's Chinatown: Fear grips many, say leaders, with mental toll rising and shops closing early","Yin, Alice",Chicago Tribune,2021-03-21,"Chicago's Chinatown leaders gathered Thursday to send a message that the Asian American community would stand strong in the aftermath of a shooting spree across three Atlanta-area spas that killed eight people, six of them Asian women, but they noted over the past year there has been a paralyzing fear too. 
Chinese residents have flooded the Midwest Asian Health Association's mental health clinic recently to seek treatment for stress, anxiety and even suicide attempts, Executive Director Hong Liu said during a news conference. They talk about being scared to go outside to exercise or head to work. Small business owners are closing shop earlier and earlier.
""We've got to work together to stop the crime, to stop the violence and stop the anti-Asian hate crime,"" Liu said. ""In the past year, there is increasing number of hate crimes and criminal activities and killing, which (is) not only a threat to our safety, life, but also mental health.""
Liu and other Chinatown community members called the gathering following Tuesday evening's shootings across two spas in Atlanta and one in its suburbs. The attack, they said, is the latest assault on Asian American people in the U.S. during a chilling year of heightened violence against them. Robert Aaron Long, a 21-year-old white man, has been charged with murder in their deaths.
Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez, 25th, said since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, which was first identified in China and former President Donald Trump referred to as the ""China virus,"" members of the Asian American community have faced increased racism. But anti-Asian prejudice isn't new either, he said. Now, as people are finally listening, Chicago and the rest of the U.S. must come together to condemn what he described as an ""act of terrorism.""
""This is an issue that has been affecting the Asian American community for a long time,"" Sigcho-Lopez said. ""These are the consequences of the dehumanization here of people of color, and that's across the board, ... Asian Americans, Black and brown women of color and residents who have been feeling targeted. And I think the big issue here that we need to speak about is white supremacy.""
His comments echo Mayor Lori Lightfoot's Wednesday remarks that ""this wasn't anything random, that it was intentional, and it feels to me, as a former member of law enforcement, like a hate crime."" Authorities in Georgia sparked outrage on Wednesday when they announced the alleged gunman's actions were not racially motivated and stemmed from a sex addiction.
A national coalition of Asian American organizations recorded 3,795 racist incidents against Asians from March 2020 to February in the U.S., 92 of them in Illinois, according to its latest report. Almost 70% of the reports came from Asian women.
David Wu, executive director of the educational Pui Tak Center, said the students of his English language classes see themselves in the victims of the spa shootings. They are immigrants who work in restaurants and nail salons, who have toiled late hours to provide for their families. And amid the pandemic, they have felt like scapegoats for the coronavirus, Wu said.
""Our students feel very traumatized right now,"" Wu said. ""They come to America hoping for new life, and especially during the pandemic they've been faced with racist incidents. ... Whether or not they've been a victim of crime, many of them feel just the shame of being targeted by others.""
Chicago police 9th District Cmdr. Don Jerome said there has been no overall recent uptick in reported crimes against Asian people, but sometimes residents of communities such as Chinatown don't feel comfortable reporting to the police. Lightfoot announced on Wednesday that Chicago police units would step up patrols in Asian American communities such as Chinatown.
""It appears from what I've seen that he did target Asian Americans,"" Jerome said about the gunman. ""So with that in mind, that's why out of an abundance of caution, we've made plans and we've prepared here in case there's similar crime. But we really don't expect it here.""
The absence of a high-profile attack in Chicago doesn't mean there hasn't been racism since the pandemic, or that it couldn't happen here, Grace Chan McKibben, the executive director of Coalition for a Better Chinese American Community, said.
""Folks are indeed worried,"" Chan McKibben said. ""People look at us with some level of suspicion, like as if we are a walking virus. The former president definitely didn't help with his rhetoric.""
She added, ""But that does not mean that we have to live in fear. We have to live instead in strength and in power.""

"'What if the next victim is me?': For Asian American women, Atlanta massacre resurfaces painful memories of racism, misogyny","Yin, Alice",Chicago Tribune,2021-03-23,"When Summer Chen talks about her life in Chicago, there is a sorrow that tinges her feelings toward the city she calls home. 
It is the place she's found her calling as a Mandarin language teacher, but it also has been the backdrop of a cascade of racist harassment that has worn her down to the point of depression at times: criticism of her Chinese accent in English, an unprompted sexual text from a former co-worker and anonymous people hacking into a remote learning session and barking racial slurs.
Following last week's shooting spree at three Atlanta-area spas that left eight dead, including six women of Asian descent, Chen said she wondered more than ever if she was safe in Chicago.
""What came to me is the strong fear for my own identity as an Asian woman,"" said Chen, a 35-year-old who lives in Bridgeport. ""What if the next victim is me?""
The massacre in Georgia followed a recent swell of reported attacks against Asian Americans and was the culmination of a year of that community feeling scapegoated for the coronavirus pandemic first detected in Wuhan, China. But for Asian American women who spoke to the Tribune, the killings last week were all the more painful because the violence reminded them of their own encounters with racism and misogyny.
That specific breed of harassment has dogged them throughout their lives, they said, and stems from centuries of America's discriminatory laws and widespread stereotyping of Asian women.
""The way Asian American women often experience racism in this country is hypersexualized,"" said Sung Yeon Choimorrow, executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum. ""It is racialized sexual harassment. That's how it's experienced, so you cannot divorce the two.""
During the first week of the academic year at the Chicago high school where Chen works, which she requested to be unnamed for her privacy, three to four anonymous users logged into her Google classroom. Chen said after she spoke Mandarin, what sounded like a group of teenage boys shouted, ""Chinese (expletive)!""
Chen tried to remove them but didn't know how, so in a panic she exited the room. She soon realized her students were still logged on, so she came back. The voices reemerged, this time using a racist term to mock the language. Then they left.
Chen said the principal was notified and from then on, teachers used a waiting room for unauthorized users. But the culprits have not been caught.
""It's like a trauma,"" Chen said. ""The school year, it's almost over, but I still have that trauma every time I open the link for my remote learning class."" 
A centuries-old pandemic
The menace of attacks against Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic has harmed male and female victims; in San Francisco, for example, an 84-year-old Thai man died earlier this year after a man shoved him onto the pavement. But a national coalition of Asian American organizations that collected 3,795 reports on anti-Asian racism from March 2020 to February found almost 70% of them came from Asian women.
Authorities identified those killed in Georgia last Tuesday as: Soon Chung Park, 74; Hyun Jung Grant, 51; Suncha Kim, 69; Yong Ae Yue, 63; Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Daoyou Feng, 44; and Xiaojie Tan, 49.
The deaths were both chilling and unsurprising to Choimorrow, a 39-year-old Korean American woman who lives in Skokie. The Saturday before St. Patrick's Day, she took her 6-year-old daughter to downtown Chicago to see the river that had just been dyed green. When she stopped by a coffee shop off Michigan Avenue, a man waited on the other side of the door.
Choimorrow said she and the man both stood still until she opened the door. The man barged out and yelled, ""Chinese (expletive). That's right, you hold the d--- door for me. Don't expect me to hold the door for you.""
""Every time it happens, all of the experiences you've had in the past is sort of like, you sort of get re-traumatized,"" Choimorrow said. ""It's the reoccurrence of these things that happen that really is what causes us the most harm.""
Exactly a year before the Georgia shootings, Archer Heights resident Sara Zhang winced when then-President Donald Trump first tweeted a racist slur for the coronavirus, sparking an uproar among Asian American leaders who feared it would expose their communities to violence. But anti-Asian racism neither began nor ended with the Trump era, she said.
Violence against Asians and Asian women in particular ""didn't just suddenly come out of nowhere"" as a result of Trump using racist slurs for the virus, said Zhang, an 18-year-old freshman at the University of Southern California. ""It's something that's historically rooted from the brutality of white supremacy and American imperialism.""
Scholars of Asian American history trace the hypersexualization of Asian women to 1875, when the U.S. government passed the Page Act that effectively banned Chinese women from entering the country under the guise of prohibiting entry for what it described as ""immoral"" immigrants such as sex workers. It preceded the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act that included Chinese men. During the 20th century, American military occupation of Asian countries such as South Korea and Vietnam drove a sex industry as well as the fetishization of Asian women as sexual objects.
Zhang said she feels the weight of those stereotypes envelop her whenever she steps outside. Twice, she's been groped by men while she was a teenage girl, once at the CTA's Roosevelt Red Line stop and another time near her high school, Payton College Prep.
""I am an Asian woman, and I have to be aware of who I'm around,"" Zhang said. ""Whenever I go into these public spaces, I feel uncomfortable."" 
Debunking the 'model minority' myth
Over recent decades, Asian Americans have become associated with a new stereotype: the successful immigrant. As a group, they have the highest median income and education levels among racial groups, according to the Pew Research Center. But the label ""Asian American"" is exceedingly diverse -- an umbrella term for more than two dozen nationalities -- and also encompasses the U.S. racial group with the highest income inequality.
The triumph of some Asian Americans should not be attributed to an innate work ethic, scholars Min Zhou and Jennifer Lee argue in their 2017 paper ""Understanding the Asian American Achievement Paradox."" They say that since the 1965 immigration act allowed more Asians to come to the U.S., a ""hyper-selectivity"" took root as immigrants from countries such as China were more likely to have bachelor's degrees compared with the rest of their originating country's population.
Lan Ho, a 30-year-old Vietnamese American woman who lives in the West Loop, said the elevation of prosperous Asian Americans, also known as the ""model minority"" myth, has masked the larger community's struggles and led to pushback last week to the notion that the Georgia shootings should be considered a hate crime. Authorities have said they are still investigating the cause.
""America tells us that we're not allowed to call it racism because we are essentially deemed the main beneficiaries of the American Dream,"" said Ho, co-founder of the Vietnamese coffee startup Fat Miilk. ""'You guys are out here being doctors and engineers and taking all of these really prestigious roles.' ... We say no to that.""
The day after the shooting spree, Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said early indicators showed the attacks ""may not be"" racially motivated. Capt. Jay Baker elaborated that Robert Aaron Long, a 21-year-old white man who was charged with murder in the eight deaths, told police he was provoked by a ""sex addiction."" Baker was later removed as the spokesman for the case after he also said Long had ""a really bad day"" and after an old Facebook post of Baker's surfaced with him promoting racist language tying China to the coronavirus.
Grace Pai, organizing director of the Chicago chapter of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, said the idea that the attacks were not racially motivated is ""ridiculous.""
""Anybody can look at what he did: He targeted three Asian businesses and killed mostly Asian American women,"" Pai said about the alleged gunman. ""How is that not racially motivated?""
Pai said the news of the Georgia shootings felt like a familiar nightmare come true. Fearing a wave of violence, Asian Americans Advancing Justice in Chicago had begun bystander intervention trainings last October, educating about 1,000 people as of last week on how to step in when they see anti-Asian harassment or discrimination.
Pai's organization also supports a proposal before the Illinois General Assembly that would require public schools to teach Asian American history. The legislation cleared a House committee the day after the mass shooting and now heads to the full chamber for further consideration. ""It's important to recognize Asian Americans in all their dimensions and afford us our full humanity rather than thinking of us only in terms of those success stories or the invisible, cheap labor that is also another prevalent view of our community,"" said state Rep. Theresa Mah, a Chicago Democrat co-sponsoring the proposal and whose 2nd House District includes Chicago's Chinatown.
This past Saturday, Chen, the Mandarin teacher from Bridgeport, stepped onto a bench at the foot of the Illinois Centennial Monument in Logan Square and peered out into the sea of hundreds of faces during a ""Stop Asian Hate"" rally. One of them was her 8-year-old son's.
Her stories of racism and misogyny, bottled up for years, flowed from her as she gripped the megaphone. But so did something else: pride in an identity under attack.
""I am proud to be an Asian woman,"" Chen said in an interview later that day. ""The reason I was there today is not only to speak up for myself as an Asian woman ... it's for my own children in the future. I don't want them to live in fear.""

My anxiety about being Asian in America has morphed into fear,Sharon Kim Soldati,Chicago Tribune,2021-03-08,"My parents live on the outskirts of Atlanta, and I am worried about them.
Since the start of the pandemic, there has been a significant uptick in hate crimes against Asians in America. In
the past few weeks, we've seen horrifying reports of Asian Americans being harassed and punched, an elderly
man thrown to the ground and killed in San Francisco, another slashed in the face and left to bleed inside a New
York City subway car, as well as countless videos of enraged people shouting at Asian Americans to go back to
their countries and even spitting in their faces.
The recent turn of events is shocking but not surprising. For many Asian Americans, anti-Asian sentiments are
borne in silence and isolation. I grew up mostly being embarrassed about my Korean heritage. In the U.S., we
Koreans have to prove that we are American, even if we were born and raised here, by pushing ourselves to
excel at school and work. As children, some of us refused to learn to speak Korean. By doing so, we shed much
of our ethnic identities.
I was always acutely aware of how I should try to fit in. When I was 4 years old, we moved to Vancouver,
Canada, where we lived in a predominantly white neighborhood. When I started elementary school in the late
1970s, many people had never heard of Korea. Another Asian girl in my class by the name of Ming Ming would
sit at the corner of one of the long lunch tables with her thermos of noodles. The other children would wince at
the smell. I did not fare better. Next to her, I would open up my doshirak, a Korean lunch box packed with fried
rice, meat and vegetables and a pair of chopsticks that fit neatly inside. Mimicking the other children, I would scrunch up my nose at my own lunchbox and pretend that its contents were equally offensive to me.
When I got home, I cornered my mother. Why couldn't she just pack me a normal lunch like peanut-butter-andjelly sandwiches?
""How is that even healthy?"" my mother countered. ""There are no vegetables in there!"" But my mother obliged,
and to my relief, I was sent to school with a Western-styled sandwich.
One of my mother's favorite words in Korean is cham-ah, meaning to endure. It is what she and her family had
to do when they escaped North Korea during the winter of 1950. Traveling on foot from Pyongyang to Seoul,
they crossed icy rivers and ran for cover from bombings and artillery fire before riding on the roof of a U.S.
military cargo train from Seoul to Daegu.
My parents arrived in Los Angeles in the 1970s and worked as janitors at the Shubert Theater, saving money to
buy their first grocery store in a Spanish-speaking neighborhood. Unable to secure a permanent visa for our
family, we moved to Canada, where they cleaned fish at a local market and bought a hardware store. When my
mom got her medical technologist certification, she found a job in New York and we moved back to the States.
Through all of their struggles to make ends meet, they instilled in us the concept of enduring. If someone
mistreated us, we were told not to make a fuss. Cham-ah. When my schoolteacher told my parents that my
Korean name was too difficult to pronounce, they consulted our church minister, who provided us with
Americanized names. Giving up our Korean names was a small price to pay to fit in. Cham-ah.
Even today, I will rarely speak out when someone throws out a racial slur. I think to myself, is it really worth it?
It could be so much worse. Cham-ah. At the counter of a sandwich shop, the woman who rings me up says very
loudly with exaggerated enunciation how much my order costs, holding up seven fingers, in case I might be
hearing impaired in addition to not understanding English. Cham-ah.
All my life I felt like being Asian in America was a shortcoming I had to make up for by working hard and not
sticking out too much. But recently, this low-grade anxiety has morphed into actual fear. Fear for my aging
parents, relatives and their friends.
I am hoping the coming herd immunity against the coronavirus might bring with it a new era of racial tolerance.
That vanquishing COVID-19 might also mean diminishing these racial attacks, particularly on our elders whom
we have been raised to respect and honor. But we can't wait for that to happen. It is time to speak up about
anti-Asian hate crimes.",4300
I'm a multicultural teen trying to fit into our 'melting pot' ,"Liu, Amelie ",Chicago Tribune,2021-04-19,"Reading the latest news, I remain silent and unsurprised as my dumbfounded friends, teachers and primarily white family members gasp. 
""Two Asian Women Beaten and Robbed in San Francisco."" ""8 Dead in Atlanta Spa Shootings, With Fears of Anti-Asian Bias."" ""Spit On, Yelled At, Attacked: Chinese- Americans Fear for Their Safety."" 
While COVID-19 has escalated discrimination against Asians, Asian-hate is not new to me, and it is especially not new in America. But in the wake of the recent Asian- hate crimes, I can't stop thinking about the children of the victims -- many of whom are multiracial, born in America and rarely considered in conversations about racism. 
The challenges we face are growing, not going away. According to a 2015 Pew Research Center study, nearly half of all multiracial Americans were under 18 years old. A whole generation of children are experiencing racism this nation does not see, and even their parents cannot relate to. 
But I can. A few weeks ago, I was excitedly, nervously talking with my friends about the fact that in just a year we'll have our driver's licenses. Then a boy on the other side of the cafeteria shouted at me: ""How are you going to see the road through those eyes?"" I told him it wasn't funny. I told him it was racist. But after that moment, I felt utterly alone. That's the experience of being a multiracial kid in America. 
When I came home that day, my Jewish mom tried to comfort and relate to me, saying she had been bullied for being chubby as a teenager. I love my mom, but at that moment, I wished my Chinese dad was there. Even though he died when I was only 7, I thought that by seeing his face I would like the slenderness of my eyes, the flatness of my nose and the softness of my jawline. My looks are deceiving, just as the experience of being a multiracial kid in America is deceptively lonely. Looking back, I realize that even if my parents had both been there, they could not have changed the inadequacy I felt because neither of them is multiracial. 
My favorite author, Peter Ho Davies, writes that a Chinese-American biracial individual's experience is not that of the two identities on either side of the hyphen; instead, it is the hyphen itself. ""In their various ways, they feel themselves to be insufficiently Chinese or insufficiently American. That's a tragedy if you think the choice is either/or. But I'd argue that there's a third alternative, that's equally authentic."" 
My third alternative has Chinese food on Rosh Hashana and matzo-ball-wonton soup at Thanksgiving. And even still, I feel eternal guilt that I didn't go to Chinese school but was committed to hearing Torah stories at Sunday school. That I crave to learn about my Chinese ancestry but feel content with the knowledge I have of my Jewish side. That I felt closer to my bubbe than my nai nai. 
Multiracial people have long faced discrimination in this country. From the time of slavery, through Jim Crow and even today, light-skinned Black people have experienced a tension between a pressure to ""pass"" as white (intentionally or not) and to embrace their Black identity -- an accusation Vice President Kamala Harris experienced on both sides of the partisan aisle this past election. A recent study even showed that monoracial people believe mixed people to be more ""cognitively demanding"" than fellow monoracial people. Studies also show that mixed-race people have higher rates of mental health issues and substance abuse. Many endure the hatred of white America while simultaneously grappling with the ""-American"" part of their identity. 
Hollywood tries to represent us. One may recall the female lead of the sitcom ""Grown-ish"" and the male lead of the film ""Crazy Rich Asians"" are like me, mixed race. Yet, Hollywood knowingly or unknowingly whitewashes the figures I used to look at and naively see myself in. Importantly, it does so at the expense of honoring the biracial identity and the identity of other minorities. Society looks at me and sees Chinese. Society tells me to check one box. Asian. Two if I'm lucky. Caucasian and Asian. 
Society must recognize that multiracial people cannot be shoehorned into a single box, nor can they be expected to check all the boxes. It must stop taking one look at me, note my Chinese features, disregard my Jewish insides and decide to hate me. Identity runs much deeper than what's visible on the surface. We must call greater attention to our nation's third alternative, our hyphen. Our identity is complex. It's not binary. It's multilayered. And, it's perfectly imperfectly mixed. ",4592
National group received 67 reports of anti-Asian hate and discrimination from Mass. in 2020,"Crimaldi, Laura",Chicago Tribune,2021-02-13,"A year ago, Lunar New Year celebrations unfolded as COVID-19 began spreading globally, ushering in a new
wave of anti-Asian bias stoked by then-President Trump and the xenophobic rhetoric he used in labeling the
disease the “China virus.”
Now, as festivities this weekend mark another Lunar New Year, coronavirus vaccines offer relief from the virus
but not from the racism directed at people of Asian descent, who have seen the bias turn to violence, notably
against the elderly. The cases include the murder in San Francisco of Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thai
man; a subway attack in New York City during which a 61-year-old Flipino man was slashed across the face with
a knife; and several assaults targeting older Asian Americans in the Chinatown section of Oakland, Calif.
“This is not a problem that is new to our community,” Sam Hyun, chairman of the Massachusetts Asian American
Commission, said Saturday. “Even last year when we saw the spike happening, what we heard was a lot of
silence from the media and those in the highest seats of power.”
The national coalition Stop AAPI Hate received 67 reports from Massachusetts of anti-Asian hate and
discrimination between March 19 and Dec. 31, 2020, according to data released Tuesday.
Almost 90 percent of the cases from Massachusetts involved verbal harassment, about 7.5 percent were reports
of people being coughed on or spat upon, and 3 percent were physical assaults, said Russell Jeung, a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate and professor at San Francisco State University.
In one local incident reported to the organization, an Asian-American shopper said a woman at a grocery store
stated, “You will infect us.”
In another report from Massachusetts, a pedestrian said a driver screamed, “You're the reason I have to wear a
mask.” An elementary school teacher in Massachusetts reported that a student taunted a Chinese classmate by
claiming he had COVID-19 and telling other children not to go near him.
Jeung said only a small portion of the incidents reported to Stop AAPI Hate would qualify for prosecution under
most laws against hate crimes.
“To address most of the hate incidents, we need a different type of policy solution and that includes expanded
civil rights enforcement,” he said.
A bill to reform the state's hate crime statute is pending in the Legislature and would expand the law to cover
harassment. Attorney General Maura Healey is co-sponsoring the legislation.
On Tuesday, she encouraged people to report hate crimes against Asian Americans to her office.
“Anti-Asian violence is on the rise,” she wrote. “The recent assaults on our elders are deeply disturbing.”
The state's Asian American Commission has developed a system for collecting reports about hate incidents and
has been using its online platforms to promote resources to combat the violence. Last spring, the commission
published a manual for responding to anti-Asian violence.
While several prominent activists and organizers said they haven't received reports about local Asian
communities being subjected to the same type of violence documented in California and New York, the incidents
have taken a psychological toll.
“It just adds to their level of stress,” said Ben Hires, chief executive of the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood
Center.
Boston City Councilor Ed Flynn, who represents Chinatown, said some of the neighborhood's elderly residents
worry about leaving their homes to buy food or get fresh air because they fear being harassed in public.
“We have to show more empathy to the Asian community for the very difficult year that they've had,” said
Flynn. “They need to know that we're on their side and we're going to do everything we can to be helpful when
there is discrimination and bullying and intimidation or name calling.”
One way some advocates are trying to fight anti-Asian bias is by encouraging bystanders to speak up when they
witness wrongdoing. Distrust of law enforcement, language barriers, and immigration status sometimes prevent
victims from coming forward and that's why it's important for others to step up, they said.
“A lot of the folks that are being targeted, they're not going to be able to defend themselves or they're not going
to report it so we need to the community speak up for them,” Hires said.
President Biden addressed the racism, harassment, and hate crimes directed in a video marking the Lunar New
Year.
“It's simply wrong,” he said. “It's a stain on our national character. Every person, no matter their race,
background, religion, or language they speak, deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.”
Last month, Biden signed an executive order condemning anti-Asian racism and directed the Department of Justice to tackle the problem more aggressively.
Jessica “Jay” Wong, interim executive director of the Asian American Commission, said her community needs
to hear more messages of support from local leaders.
“We need our leaders to show that they are actively working to make our community feel safe and not feel
alone,” she said. “None of this should ever be tolerated.”",5081
"As virus spreads, so does anti-Asian racism online","Timberg, Craig; Chiu, Allyson",Washington Post,2020-04-10,"Fears of the coronavirus have fueled rising anti-Chinese sentiment online as a combination of traditional slurs and new terms such as ""kungflu"" conflate the
pandemic with ethnic and national identity, say social media researchers who tracked surging expressions of hostility for papers published Wednesday.
The researchers fear online hatred and distrust toward China and people of East Asian descent are contributing to an increasingly well-documented rash of
real-world incidents, including verbal attacks, violence and boycotts of Asian-owned businesses.
""The words are like a virus,"" said Joel Finkelstein, director of the Network Contagion Research Institute, a New Jersey-based nonprofit group that tracks hate
speech online. ""That leads to actions that are visible.""
Finkelstein's group, which reports its findings as alerts to government officials, documented a rise of conspiracy theories featuring both anti-Chinese sentiment
and words such as ""bioweapon"" on 4chan's notoriously racist ""Politically Incorrect"" message board and, to a lesser extent, on Twitter, according to one of the
papers.
That paper detailed ""acute increases in both the vitriol and magnitude of ethnic hate"" and said they fueled the spread of misinformation from remote corners
of the Internet into the mainstream. It also noted that an Instagram post last week called for shooting ""every Asian we meet in Chinatown, that's the only way
we can destroy the epidemic of coronavirus in NYC!"" (Instagram removed the post as a violation of its policies.)
A second research group, featuring an international team of scholars from China, Cyprus, Italy, Germany and the United States, published separate research
showing that anti-Chinese slurs on 4chan grew sharply at key moments in the pandemic. It also found less pronounced rises in hostile references to China and
Chinese people on Twitter.
The title of that paper highlighted one of the many anti-Asian comments the team captured from 4chan, "" 'Go eat a bat, Chang!': An Early Look on the
Emergence of Sinophobic Behavior on Web Communities in the Face of COVID-19."" Another 4chan post was even blunter, saying ""THIS IS BIOTERRORISM
NUKE CHINA NOW."" (The paper has not yet been peer-reviewed, a process that typically takes months.)
Both research groups, which include some overlapping members, charted rises in these slurs near the peak of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, where the
pandemic began, and again last month when President Trump used the term ""Chinese Virus"" on Twitter.
The research does not seek to evaluate whether Trump's comments caused the surge of ethnic slurs on 4chan, but ""that was a legitimizing moment,"" said
Jeremy Blackburn, an assistant professor of computer science at Binghamton University who studies online hate. He was a co-author for both papers.
Beyond the Internet, anti-Chinese rhetoric already has had real-life implications in the United States, despite warnings from experts that prolific use of such
language could endanger millions of Asian Americans.
""When it becomes normalized . . . it dehumanizes Chinese and Asians,"" said Russell Jeung, chair of San Francisco State University's Asian American studies
department. ""It's like equating them to a face mask and equating them to the disease, so it's easy to scapegoat and attack them.""
People who look Chinese, particularly those wearing masks, are at increased risk of experiencing the same discrimination faced by people wearing turbans in
the aftermath of the 9/11, attacks, said Jeung, who recently started tracking bias incidents against Asian Americans amid the ongoing pandemic.
At first, Jeung's work consisted of analyzing news articles about the coronavirus, xenophobia and racism. It didn't take long, he said, for a ""clear pattern"" to
emerge.
""Following xenophobic policies or statements, the next week we would see boycotts of Asian businesses and then the following week more interpersonal
attacks on Asian individuals,"" he said.
A website, ""Stop AAPI Hate"" started by Jeung and two community groups, has documented more than 1,100 incidents targeting Asian Americans in at least 36
states since launching last month. (AAPI refers to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.)
The incidents have ranged from verbal harassment and shunning to physical assault.
On March 9, a woman in San Francisco said she was spat on by a man yelling expletives about China, the New York Times reported. Later that month, an
Asian woman riding a New York City bus was targeted by several other passengers who called her a racial slur and accused her of causing the coronavirus,
WPIX reported. One of the attackers then struck the woman on the head with an umbrella, resulting in an injury that needed stitches, according to the news
station.
Yang Zhang, a Chinese co-author on the paper written by the international coalition of scholars, said he grew interested in the subject after a Chinese student
he knows had an unpleasant encounter on a bus in Germany. One passenger said to another that the student was a ""Chinese virus,"" said Zhang, a computer
scientist at the Helmholtz Center for Information Security, in Saarbrücken, Germany.
Zhang said that ""even as a man who is used to hearing racial slurs about Chinese people,"" he was startled to discover the range and intensity of hateful
language he found on social media once he began research for the paper. Like the others, he worried that the hostility already had spilled out in the offline
world.
""I always treat social media data as a good sensor of the real world,"" said Zhang.
Charissa Cheah, a psychology professor at the University of Maryland at Baltimore County who is leading another study examining discrimination against
Chinese Americans during the pandemic, said anti-Chinese language such as ""kungflu"" and ""batsoup"" have their roots in historically racist tropes that have
long been used to denigrate Asian Americans and cast them as foreigners no matter how long they have lived in the United States.
""Covid-19 is merely refueling processes that are already there,"" said Cheah, whose research will also study Twitter activity related to the outbreak. ""I worry
that we might interpret these findings as, 'Oh, it's covid-19 that's causing it.' This is simply not true. The current pandemic is merely providing an outlet and
making it easier to justify expressions of Sinophobia."" Covid-19 is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
Another indicator of rising hostility toward China is the surging use of Twitter hashtags such as #BlameChina, #ChinaLiedPeopleDied, #ChinaVirus,
#WuhanCoronaVirus and #ChinaCoronaVirus, according to an unpublished analysis done by Clemson University researcher Darren Linvill.
The hashtag #ChineseVirus surged to nearly 130,000 uses the day after Trump used it in a tweet. Linvill, an assistant professor of communication, said the
use was particularly prominent among accounts that regularly support Trump on Twitter.
But he cautioned that the character of anti-Chinese expressions varies sharply across social media platforms.
""Anti-Chinese sentiment is rising, and it manifests itself differently in different places,"" Linvill said. ""On 4chan, it's racist. On Twitter, it's political.""
Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough said that the study by the international group of scholars, which like most academic research on Twitter relied on a 1
percent sample of all tweets, may miss the ""nuanced political context around content that is posted on Twitter.""
""We have zero-tolerance policies in place that address clear threats of violence, abuse and harassment, and hateful conduct,"" she said. ""If we identify accounts
that violate these rules, we'll take enforcement action.""
A week after Trump started publicly calling coronavirus the ""Chinese virus"" and defended his use of the label against critics who accused him of being racist,
the president implored people on Twitter to ""protect our Asian American community.""
The president also stopped using ""Chinese virus"" on social media and during news briefings.",8036
Inflaming fears during a crisis,None,Washington Post,2020-04-09,"In his April 3 op-ed, ""We are not the virus, but we can be part of the solution,"" Andrew Yang failed to recognize the fundamental reality of the racism that drives a teenager to
call him by a slur, or the three men who glared at him with the accusatory look that he is to blame for the novel coronavirus. Those actions against him were not something he
will be able to prove to those people to be wrong; they come from a fundamental dehumanizing perspective held by those people.
Mr. Yang said Japanese Americans proved their loyalty and demonstrated our American-ness by serving in the military. The service of Japanese Americans in World War II was
out of a deep love for our country and its ideals. But the families of those who died in battle were still informed of their loss behind the barbed wire of American concentration
camps.
More insidious was his promotion of the model minority myth. If we can prove our worth to white American society, then we will be accepted - at the expense of other minority
groups ostensibly not as worthy of acceptance. Though Asian Americans are taking the brunt of the discrimination, immigrants have also been scapegoated, and anti-Semitic
conspiracy theories abound about the spread of the coronavirus.
Fear of covid-19 is inflaming fear of those of us who seem different. That doesn't mean we need to change who we are, nor do we need to disprove someone else's prejudices.
We need allies to call out those who exhibit prejudice.
I am a proud American; I don't need to prove it to anyone.
David Inoue, Washington
The writer is executive director for the Japanese American Citizens League.
As a first-generation Chinese American, I am appalled and outraged by Andrew Yang's comments on recent racist attacks against Asian Americans. Mr. Yang bent over backward
to sympathize with and excuse the behavior of people making such attacks and insisted that Asian Americans must disarm such racism by becoming more visibly American: ""We
need to step up, help our neighbors, donate gear, vote, wear red white and blue, volunteer.""
Asian Americans have been doing, and are continuing to do, those things and more, but those acts of being ""more American"" have zero impact on people with bigotry and racial
hatred in their hearts. Does Mr. Yang really believe that the 2-year-old Asian American girl and her 6-year-old sibling who were recently stabbed at a Sam's Club in Texas would
have been spared if only they had been wearing more patriotic clothing?
It is especially telling that Mr. Yang mentions Japanese Americans during World War II, who ""volunteered for military duty at the highest possible levels to demonstrate that they
were Americans."" Yes, they did, and what did it get them? Internment in concentration camps.
Mr. Yang was blaming the victim at a time when Asian Americans are at their most vulnerable position in decades. It is not the job of victims of racism to act in a more pleasing
way. It is the job of everyone to stand up to and fight racial injustice for all races and stop giving excuses for not doing so.

I need a new thesaurus to describe President Trump's continued retaliation against and firing of patriotic Americans. Grotesque, disgusting, repellent, frightening, horrifying -
these words just aren't sufficient anymore.
Call the roll: Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman - who testified truthfully about Mr. Trump's egregious corrupt behavior - and his twin brother, Yevgeny Vindman, who did nothing more
than be his brother's twin. Capt. Brett Crozier of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, who was desperate to save his sailors' lives. Michael Atkinson, inspector general for the
intelligence community, who was the conduit for the whistleblower complaint that led to Mr. Trump's impeachment. Former FBI director James B. Comey; former FBI deputy
director Andrew McCabe; former European Union ambassador Gordon Sondland; former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Mr. Trump is firing anyone whose actions result
in something negative for him.
Where is the hue and cry from the GOP senators and representatives? Is there not one spine among them?
As I said, I need a new thesaurus.

Dan Balz's April 5 The Take column, ""Once again, government is caught unprepared,"" affirmed the reality for many who have served in government that its vast authorities and
resources can be most effectively deployed when leaders demonstrate their unequivocal belief in the agencies' missions, amplify their officials' capabilities and skills, and
empower both the organizations and individuals to act - not just react - in times of crisis.
Mr. Balz cited the Pentagon's predilection for planning and its thorough preparedness for the last disaster, more than for the next. But its most impactful capabilities, unmatched
by any other institution in government or business, are the ingenuity and resourcefulness of its mid-level officers, senior noncommissioned officers and technical experts,
combined with its relentless emphasis on individual and unit training.
The Iraq War revealed this national asset, as thousands of lieutenants and captains, sergeants and civilians broke through the geographic and functional silos that often impede
innovation by using their tactical knowledge and communications skills and systems to identify problems, convey data, improvise workarounds and share field solutions despite -
not because of - the established hierarchy, technological norms and conventional doctrine.
When the Army War College and its sister institutions teach future officers the lessons of Gettysburg and other historic battles, they should compare the constructive
experiences from Iraq and other recent countercultural revolutions in military and business practices, with the negative evidence that Mr. Balz distilled from today's pandemic,
for the sake of generations to come.

"We are not the virus, but we can be part of the solution","Yang, Andrew",Washington Post,2020-04-03,"Last week, I was shopping for groceries and preparing to hole up at home with my wife, Evelyn, and our two boys. There was an eerie, peculiar aura in the parking lot in upstate
New York as night fell and shoppers wheeled out essentials and snacks.
Three middle-aged men in hoodies and sweatshirts stood outside the entrance of the grocery store. They huddled together talking. One looked up at me and frowned. There was
something accusatory in his eyes. And then, for the first time in years, I felt it.
I felt self-conscious - even a bit ashamed - of being Asian.
It had been years since I felt that way. I grew up with semi-regular visitations of that sense of racially tinged self- consciousness. It didn't help that I was an awkward kid. But
after adulthood, marriage, a career, parenthood, positions of leadership and even a presidential run, that feeling had disappeared - I thought.
My place in this country felt assured. I have it better than the vast majority of Americans of any background. When comedian Shane Gillis slurred me by name, I did not think
he deserved to lose his job. It barely registered when a teenager yelled ""Chink"" at me from the window of his car in New Hampshire a number of months ago. My only reaction
was to think, ""Well, I'm glad that neither of my sons was around because, then I might have to explain to them what that word means.""
But things have changed.
Over the past few weeks, the number of reported physical and verbal attacks on Asian Americans has increased dramatically. The percentage of Asians who use the not-forprofit Crisis Text Line to speak with a counselor has shot up from 5 percent of callers - about in line with our share of the population - to 13 percent, an increase of 160 percent.
Some level of background disdain or alienation has grown into outright hostility and even aggression.
And we all know why. The coronavirus is devastating communities and lives. People's livelihoods and families are being destroyed. And people are looking for someone to blame.
Before covid-19, too many Americans were already living paycheck to paycheck, working long hours just to get by. Now, we all are even more fearful for the future, worried
about our parents, grandparents and children. We are anxious about our jobs, bills and next month's rent or mortgage payment.
In early February, when I was still running for president, someone asked me, ""How do we keep the coronavirus from inciting hostility toward Asians in this country?""
I responded, ""The truth is that people are wired to make attributions based on appearance, including race. The best thing that could happen for Asians would be to get this virus
under control so it isn't a problem anymore. Then any racism would likely fade."" This was weeks before ""Chinese virus"" became a thing.
Now it is, and we have to figure out how to combat that, too. I'm an entrepreneur. In general, negative responses don't work. I obviously think that being racist is not a good
thing. But saying ""Don't be racist toward Asians"" won't work.
I have been thinking about ways to improve that encounter at the grocery store. People are hurting. They look up and see someone who is different from them, whom they
wrongly associate with the upheaval of their way of life.
Natalie Chou, a UCLA basketball player, said she felt better when she wore her UCLA gear, in part because the association reminded people that she was an American.
During World War II, Japanese Americans volunteered for military duty at the highest possible levels to demonstrate that they were Americans. Now many in the Asian American
community are stepping up, trying to demonstrate that we can be part of the solution. Some 17 percent of U.S. doctors are Asian and rushing to the front lines.
We Asian Americans need to embrace and show our American-ness in ways we never have before. We need to step up, help our neighbors, donate gear, vote, wear red white
and blue, volunteer, fund aid organizations, and do everything in our power to accelerate the end of this crisis. We should show without a shadow of a doubt that we are
Americans who will do our part for our country in this time of need.
Demonstrate that we are part of the solution. We are not the virus, but we can be part of the cure.

Trump is stoking xenophobic panic in a time of crisis,"Lieu, Ted",Washington Post,2020-03-19,"I genuinely want President Trump to succeed in stopping the spread of the novel coronavirus, and will do everything I can to help him in this effort. At stake are the lives of my
elderly parents, my family, my constituents and many Americans. But Trump's repeated insistence on calling coronavirus the ""Chinese virus"" is more than just xenophobic; it
causes harm both to Asian Americans and to the White House's response to this life-threatening pandemic. I served on active duty in the U.S. military to defend the right of any
American to make politically incorrect statements, but as a public figure, I cannot stand idly by while the president uses his pulpit to exacerbate xenophobia in a time of crisis.
Trump claims that in using the phrase ""Chinese virus,"" he's just trying to be ""accurate"" in describing where it's from. But there is a difference between saying the virus is from
China and saying it is a Chinese virus. In a time of unease and uncertainty, such language stokes xenophobic panic and doesn't get us closer to eradicating this virus. Asian
Americans have been assaulted or otherwise discriminated against because of such rhetoric. In New York, a man assaulted an Asian woman wearing a face mask and called her
a ""diseased b---h."" Also in New York, a man on the subway sprayed an Asian passenger with Febreze and verbally abused him. On the subway in Los Angeles, a man ranted at
an Asian American woman, claiming Chinese people are putrid and responsible for all diseases. (The woman happened to be Thai American.)
Trump's rhetoric adds fuel to the growing fire of hatred being misdirected at Asian Americans. The fact that he is the president of the United States, who is responsible for the
well-being of all Americans, only makes his rhetoric even more disturbing. The leaders of both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization
have warned that we should not use terms such as ""Chinese virus."" The novel coronavirus already has an official name, SARS-CoV-2, and an unofficial name, covid-19. Injecting
an ethnic qualifier to the virus is unnecessary and can stigmatize Asian Americans.
Against the backdrop of Trump's unnecessary language lies the history of discrimination against Asian Americans in our country. From the Chinese Exclusion Act to the
internment camps of World War II to the murder of Vincent Chin , Asian Americans are particularly susceptible to being discriminated against by the mistaken belief that we
somehow are foreigners or have foreign ties.
It was myopic thinking to pretend this was a foreign virus that wouldn't become our problem, and it has contributed to our present frantic efforts to play catch-up. On Jan. 22,
Trump was asked on CNBC, ""Are there worries about a pandemic at this point?"" He responded: ""No. Not at all. And we have it totally under control. It's one person coming in
from China, and we have it under control. It's going to be just fine.""
Trump's weak initial response of only barring foreign nationals - either from China or who had visited China - from entering the United States allowed Americans traveling from
China and anyone from Europe to enter the United States with the virus. The president's view that the virus was a Chinese problem contributed to his failure to understand the
importance of testing people domestically for the virus and of having enough medical equipment to deal with the outbreak.
We are still woefully short of test kits across the United States as well as the chemical reagents necessary to process tests. The coronavirus has spread exponentially as a result,
and if that is not mitigated, we will not have enough ventilators for the patients who need them to stay alive. Hospitals and first responders are starting to run out of personal
protective equipment - essential for keeping them healthy and safe.
One country that can help happens to be China. Though the Chinese government certainly made mistakes at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, we can learn a lot from
Chinese doctors and scientists who were on the front lines of this crisis and also cooperate and get vital medical equipment and supplies. China recently sent doctors,
ventilators, face masks and protective suits to Italy.
For the president to continue using rhetoric that the Chinese find insulting is not helpful. It is not one country's problem to solve. We are in a worldwide, life-threatening
pandemic, and we all need to work together. I wish the president could set aside his xenophobia for the moment while we try to keep Americans from dying.

Reopening may not ease pressures on Asian-owned businesses,"Knowles, Hannah; Kim Bellware",Washington Post,2020-05-17,"Fear sent Mei Chau's restaurant spiraling well before New York City halted in-person dining - as much as 20 percent of her business was gone each week
starting in late January, until one day there were just three orders.
It was people's fear of coming to Manhattan's Chinatown, Chau believes, but also Asian families' fears of going out as they watched the coronavirus upend
China's most important holiday. It was fear, she says, of being punched, spat on or glared at because of her race or mask on the subway. It was fear of
bringing covid-19 to the older generation in an immigrant family's cramped apartment.
Each on its own was terrifying. But the combination, the 56-year-old says, ""is just impossible."" Now a banner on Chau's website declares that her decadesold Malaysian-French restaurant is ready to ""REOPEN!"" - but staff who have to commute from outside the neighborhood won't come back yet to Aux Epices,
Chau says, and she wakes up sweating from nightmares about crowds.
Asian-owned businesses are facing a crippling pileup of pressures during the coronavirus pandemic, advocates and researchers say - pressures that won't all
ease with the country's piecemeal reopening. They've been hurting longer, seeing their group's unemployment rate skyrocket faster, and struggling like many
minority-owned shops to access government aid, often in industries with especially uncertain roads to recovery.
Layered on top as they struggle to reopen: anxiety about attacks and discrimination, as Asian Americans get caught up in a political fight.
For some who think national leaders are encouraging people to link Asians and the coronavirus - blaming China for the pandemic has become a full-fledged
Republican political strategy - the stakes are higher than the fate of family businesses and already-threatened Chinatowns. They're about what kind of
country the United States wants to be.
""Across the nation . . . there is this rise of this blame game,"" said Wellington Chen, who heads Chinatown Partnership, a nonprofit group supporting the
district in New York City. ""This is this legacy moment. . . . What did you guys do? Did you beat up on your neighbors? Is that what you're proud of?""
Economic devastation
In mid-February in Houston, when analysts were still predicting ""very isolated"" damage to the restaurant industry, business owners in that city's Chinatown -
falsely rumored to have a coronavirus outbreak - were talking about hits to businesses worse than after Hurricane Harvey. Even Chinese American medical
practices struggled in New York City, where one doctor attributed 10 to 15 percent drops in traffic to patients' fears of public transportation.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) went to San Francisco's Chinatown early this year to urge customers back.
The struggles of Asian American businesses have faded from the national spotlight as the pandemic takes hold all over the country, even as these businesses
happen to concentrate in industries facing extended shutdowns, thinner margins and risky futures in the era of social distancing.
As of last month, nearly 10 percent of Asian-owned companies in the United States were restaurants or other food businesses, a share far higher than any
other group, according to an analysis by Robert Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
Asian business owners are important employers for their communities, experts said, meaning losses radiate outward.
While the coronavirus has hit black and Latino communities especially hard, statistics in New York City also point to a dramatic fallout for Asians, who have
seen the sharpest increase in unemployment nationwide since February.
Less than half of Manhattan Chinatown's restaurants remained open for takeout after mid-March, when the city announced its sweeping shutdown, said
Chen, of Chinatown Partnership. Business advocates in several immigrant communities said it's tough to know yet how many are closed for good, when calls
go unreturned and it can feel rude to even raise the possibility of no return.
""I wish there was more attention from our elected officials,"" said Jennifer Tam, a Chinatown resident who launched a volunteer effort there.
'Their words carry a lot of weight'
With anti-Asian racism flaring during the pandemic, many fear leaders' rhetoric against China could make the return to normal more perilous.
Business after business has forgone even online orders and pickup both ""out of fear of the virus and out of fear of retaliation because of the virus,"" said
Vicente Reid, CEO of Arizona's Asian Chamber of Commerce.
In Georgia, where the push to reopen has been especially aggressive, the couple that owns Chong Qing Hot Pot in Chamblee, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta, has
the same worries as everyone else. What if they get sick? What if a resurgence of the virus shuts them down?
It's the racism piled onto Asian owners' anxieties that makes Gina Rivers cry. She said she thinks President Trump is enabling it.
Trump once made a point of referring to ""the Chinese virus,"" a phrase he has defended as describing the disease's origin, and a strategy memo instructed
Republicans seeking election to the Senate to ""attack China"" rather than speak to the president's handling of the coronavirus. Conservative candidates for
office across the country are taking up similar messages, with one divisive ad in Texas accusing China of having ""poisoned our people"" and leading some to
denounce ""race baiting.""
""I worry for my husband's well-being in this climate,"" said Rivers, who is white. Her husband, Liang Rivers, is from China.
Liang, who has cooked the same Szechuan menu for a decade, says he doesn't pay the president's word choices much mind. He's more worried, he said,
about the people who come in without masks and the fact they're doing half their normal business.
Historian Ellen Wu, who studies the Asian experience in America, worries public information campaigns promoting the Asian community will be undermined
by ""all this messaging right from the top - the really dispiriting messages about the 'China virus.' ""
""The people in power, their words carry a lot of weight,"" said the assistant professor at Indiana University in Bloomington.
Even an offhand comment can unintentionally stoke fears of racism. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) sowed panic last week in Vietnamese salon circles
when he said the state's first community transmission of the coronavirus occurred through a nail business.
""We're not Chinese, but we're still Asians, right?"" said Tracy Tran, who used to employ more than 50 people at several salons in Southern California. ""It will
affect us,"" she said.
'Every day is a new day'
In New York City, people in Chinatown are trying to help each other. A volunteer effort of about 20 Asian American professionals has raised more than
$100,000 to buy meals for front-line workers from Chinatown restaurants starved for orders, while the nonprofit Chinatown Partnership worked with local
lawmakers last month to kick off a campaign called Show Some Love in Chinatown. Children are helping parents: One son built Asian-Veggies.com for his
father, who started taking produce orders through WeChat and a glut of text messages.
Some see an opportunity for the Asian diaspora in the United States to marshal strength in a new way. Shirley Tang, who teaches Asian American studies at
the University of Massachusetts at Boston, said collaboration across generations and cultures can help mobilize Asian Americans to produce not only stronger
businesses but stronger communities.
""In order to survive and thrive, they need to know how to not just build their own business but find a way to enliven their whole block,"" Tang said.
Chau's restaurant, Aux Epices, is a testament to the resilience of those immigrant communities on the brink - the culmination of years of passion and
hardship overcome on the way to financial security in America. She's pushed her 10-table business through the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, natural
disasters and a landlord who hiked her rent.
Her restaurant's future, though, has never been more uncertain.
""Every day is a new day,"" she said.
Chau started what would become Aux Epices in 1993 after emigrating from Malaysia and struggling to survive on a waitress's paychecks, begging start-up
money from family and driving a hard bargain on the lease.
The naive plan, she said, was to support her painting career, the ambitions that brought her to New York City in 1986. Then the restaurant took over. She
fiddled with the menu, hung the walls with art and joined a ""sandwich renaissance,"" offering fancy rolls instead of Wonder Bread.
Chau thinks it's ""crazy"" to reopen now even for takeout, with business still dismal and the pandemic raging. But last week, she did it anyway. It felt like the
right thing to do, she said, when governors everywhere were pushing for a restart and when friends who also love Chinatown were trying so hard.
""My heart wanted to come back,"" Chau said.
A table at her entrance blocks people from coming too close in her narrow space, and she wears the face masks her staff had earlier abandoned as they
heard about attacks on Asians with covered faces. She waits for orders, though some days there are zero. Chau says she's given up on a government loan -
she has no borrowing history, and by the time she figured out the paperwork, her bank was swamped with demand, she said.
She walks with an Asian friend who remains uncomfortable going out alone.
She listens all day to the news and wishes the president would spend more time talking about increased testing, the kind that might help her staff feel safe.
""I was like, this is not the time to blame,"" she said. ""This is time to work together. In restaurants, you're always in the action mode. You don't have a passive
mode.""
""And this is a pandemic!""",9867
"As they fight virus, Asian Americans battle racism","Jan, Tracy",Washington Post,2020-05-20,"Lucy Li tries not to let fear dictate her interactions with patients as she makes the rounds in the covid-19 intensive care unit. But the anesthesiology resident at Massachusetts
General Hospital cannot erase the memory of what happened after work at the start of the pandemic.
A man followed the Chinese American doctor from the Boston hospital, spewing a profanity-laced racist tirade as she walked to the subway. ""Why are you Chinese people killing
everyone?"" Li recalled the man shouting. ""What is wrong with you? Why the f--- are you killing us?""
Stunned at first, then relieved she was not physically attacked, Li is now saddened and angered by the irony that she spends her days and nights helping to save lives. Her work
inserting tubes in patients' airways has grown riskier since the coronavirus emerged - each procedure releasing droplets and secretions that could carry viral particles.
""I'm risking my own personal health, and then to be vilified just because of what I look like,"" said Li, 28, who is wary that one of her patients, too, could harbor such prejudices.
""I try not to think about that possibility when I'm at work taking care of patients. But it's always there, at the very back of my mind.""
Across the country, Asian American health-care workers have reported a rise in incidents of bigotry. The racial hostility has left Asian Americans, who represent 6 percent of the
U.S. population but 18 percent of the country's physicians and 10 percent of its nurse practitioners, in a painful position on the front lines of the response to the coronavirus
pandemic. Some covid-19 patients refuse to be treated by them. And when doctors and nurses leave the hospital, they face increasing harassment in their daily lives, too.
Asian Americans have experienced a sharp increase in racist verbal abuse and physical attacks during the pandemic, with the FBI warning of a potential surge in hate crimes
against Asians as the coronavirus death toll mounts and stay-at-home orders are lifted.
""People are worried about transmission of a disease that they associate with foreignness and Asian faces,"" said Grace Kao, a Yale University sociologist. ""Nothing erases what we
look like.""
There is no comprehensive data measuring anti-Asian bias during the pandemic. An analysis of self-reported incidents by Russell Jeung, chairman of the Asian American studies
department at San Francisco State University, shows a steady rise in reports of harassment and assaults against Asians since mid-March, with twice as many women as men
saying they have been mistreated.
Jeung, who is researching racism and xenophobia amid the coronavirus pandemic, said a multilingual website set up by his department in a partnership with civil rights groups
to document anti-Asian harassment has recorded more than 1,800 incidents since its March 19 launch. Victims said they were spat on, stabbed while shopping, shunned for
wearing masks and barred from entering ride-hailing vehicles.
Some academic experts on race say President Trump's rhetoric regarding the virus and China has contributed to the rise in racial harassment. For weeks, Trump deliberately
referred to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" despite guidance from public health officials to avoid attaching locations or ethnicity to a disease. He has since tweeted that
Asian Americans are not to be blamed for the virus's spread.
""Words matter. People are making that close association between the virus and Chinese people because he insisted on using that term,"" Jeung said.
During a media briefing last week, Trump lashed out at CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang, who is Chinese American, telling her to ""ask China"" after she
questioned him on why he insisted on making testing a global competition at a time when so many lives are being lost. Jiang previously tweeted that a White House official had
called the virus ""the Kung-Flu"" to her face.
White House adviser Peter Navarro, in an ABC News interview Sunday, accused China of sending ""hundreds of thousands of Chinese"" to ""seed"" the coronavirus around the
world. And Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) drew criticism after he blamed the virus's spread on ""thugs in China"" in a high school graduation speech over the weekend.
Jeung said he expects harassment and violence against Asian Americans to grow in coming months as states reopen their economies and people return to work, school and
public life.
""With the China-bashing and with the economy tanking and more deaths from covid-19, we expect anti-Asian bias to only increase,"" Jeung said. ""People make automatic
assumptions, especially in times of threats, and go into fight-or-flight mode. The fight mode is attacking or harassing Asians, and the flight mode is shunning Asians.""
Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang has encouraged Asian Americans to step up and ""show our American-ness in ways we never have before,"" in response to
the rise in racist abuse. In a controversial op-ed last month, he called on Asian Americans to be part of the ""cure.""
But many Asian Americans felt offended by seemingly having to justify their existence. ""It shouldn't matter if you're a front-line worker,"" said Esther Choo, an emergency room
physician in Portland, Ore., who hosts a podcast on the coronavirus pandemic. ""Every time something like this happens, there's this wave of, 'But we're so good, and we don't
deserve this.' No, you don't deserve this because you're human.""
Being a front-line worker didn't help Li - and when she texted her colleagues to warn them before they left work, one of them responded with her own story of being harassed
just a week earlier.
Gem Manalo, a Mass General anesthesiology resident who is of Chinese and Filipino descent, was riding the ""T,"" as the subway is called in Boston, across the river to Cambridge
for a yoga class in early March when she said a man starting yelling: ""F--- China! F--- the Chinese!""
""I was too scared to look at him,"" said Manalo, 29. A stranger recorded the incident with her phone and assured Manalo that she would defend her if the man tried to physically
harm her.
""He kept saying things like: 'You people eat bats! Watch my YouTube channel tonight, and I'll tell the real story.' He kept saying: 'F--- China. F--- the Chinese,' over and over,""
Manalo said.
""Here I am in the hospital, working in all these makeshift ICUs,"" Manalo said. ""We're all at a loss, too, trying to come up with new protocols to keep everybody safe, and this
guy is telling me that I am terrible.""
Audrey Li, an internal-medicine resident at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston who plans to specialize in infectious diseases, said she was repeatedly told by a
frustrated patient at another hospital to ""go back to your country.""
Li, who was born in New Jersey to Chinese immigrant parents, was too shocked to respond and immediately wondered if she had done something wrong. But a white intern told
the patient that her comments were unacceptable.
""Part of the unsettling piece of racism is you're never sure if it's something you as an individual did or if it's something that's immutable and larger than yourself,"" said Li, 28.
""There was a sense of a little bit of guilt and shame for having forgotten what it was like to be marginalized in that way.""
In Los Angeles County, Hengky Lim, a 44-year-old nurse practitioner from Indonesia, said he approached an ER patient who had a fever and a cough to show him how to put on
a mask one night in March. The patient yelled at him and coughed in his face, spit splattering on his plastic face shield. ""You know where coronavirus is from? It's from you
people! I don't want to be seen by you,"" Lim recalled the patient shouting. Then the patient walked out of the ER.
In April, when Lim, dressed in a hazmat suit, was treating patients with covid-19 symptoms in a tent outside the main hospital, he said a man who had chest pain, difficulty
breathing and a persistent cough declined Lim's assistance and returned to see the nurse who had taken his vitals. That nurse, who was white, later told Lim that the patient
said he did not want to be seen by an Asian provider because he thought he had contracted the coronavirus from a Chinese man coughing near him at a store, Lim recalled.
""I asked the nurse, 'Are you sure it was a Chinese man?' It's just stereotyping, assuming everyone who is Asian is Chinese and has coronavirus,"" Lim said. He tried to treat the
patient anyway, telling him that he was his only choice and that he would take care of him. But the man left after spitting into a cup for the coronavirus test - and did not bother
getting the X-ray or EKG that Lim had ordered for him.
Lim said he had never before encountered such discrimination during his 10 years in nursing, but it has become such a common experience among his Asian colleagues that he
thought about quitting.
""Everybody is scared. I'm putting myself out there only to be treated this way. It's very disheartening,"" he said. ""We're not sick. You're the one who is sick, which is why you are
here. And you are exposing us as the health-care provider taking care of you, and we are treated as though we are the ones carrying the coronavirus.""
This spring in Seattle, Amy Zhang was wearing scrubs, walking to her 13-hour night shift as an anesthesiology resident, when a man began cursing at her a block away from
the hospital.
""F--- you, China, for giving us smallpox,"" the man shouted at Zhang, the 29-year-old Chinese American doctor recalled. He followed her and continued yelling racial epithets.
Zhang said the encounter shook her, affecting her ability to focus on her work at the start of her shift. ""I was not in the best state of mind to help out with patient care,"" she
said.
And in Southern California, Audrey Sue Cruz, an internal-medicine doctor in Loma Linda, was conducting a telephone visit with a new patient recently when, 15 minutes into the
appointment, the woman began grilling the physician on her medical education, work history and ethnicity.
Cruz told the patient that she is Filipina, to which she said the patient replied: ""Wow. I can't believe what your people did. I usually wouldn't choose an Asian doctor, but you
seem nice.""
Cruz quickly ended the visit. The incident inspired her to join more than a dozen other doctors in producing an #iamnotavirus video to help combat the wave of bigotry against
Asians.
""We wanted to use our voices as physicians to remove the stigma that's occurring right now about Asian people being virus carriers,"" said Cruz, 30.
She posted the video on Instagram. Then came the comments: ""Bat eater.""",10621
New spike seen in anti-Asian sentiment,"Dwoskin, Elizabeth",Washington Post,2020-10-10,"After Trump's diagnosis, hostility spread anew on Twitter, analysis finds
News of President Trump's coronavirus diagnosis is fueling renewed attacks against Asian Americans and
hostility toward China across social media, according to researchers with civil rights group the Anti-Defamation
League.
In an analysis of 2.7 million tweets in the three days after Trump announced his and first lady Melania Trump's
diagnosis on Twitter, the ADL found elevated language associated with hostility against Asians, compared with
the previous day. In the 12 hours after Trump's announcement, ADL saw an 85 percent spike in such language.
The announcement sparked thousands of online conversations blaming China for trying to purposefully infect the
president, the researchers found.
For example, in one since-deleted tweet to her 394,000 followers, pro-Trump former congressional candidate
DeAnna Lorraine said that ""China must pay for giving Trump COVID"" and swore that ""we will have justice.""
Another Twitter user with 114,000 followers blamed Chinese President Xi Jinping for trying to assassinate
Trump.
The anti-China rhetoric used by the Trump administration and its supporters throughout the pandemic has left
Asian Americans vulnerable to racist attacks, researchers have previously found. Fear, hatred and
misinformation online has led to verbal assaults, boycotts of Asian businesses and sometimes violence. A
coalition of Asian American groups, along with San Francisco State University, reported this summer that 2,120
hate incidents against Asian Americans have taken place since March.
President Trump has been at the forefront of pushing a narrative that responsibility for the virus lies with China.
In the first presidential debate on Sept. 29, Trump said the covid-19 crisis was ""China's fault"" and referred to
the virus as the ""China plague.""
""From the birther scandal to lies about immigrants to his attempt to blame China for his own failure to contain
the coronavirus, Donald Trump has built his presidency on perpetuating conspiracy theories and racism,"" Rep.
Judy Chu (D-Calif.), chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, said in a statement.
She warned that rhetoric in reaction to the president's followers blaming Asians or Jews for problems can lead to
violence.
They ""not only doubled down on the use of slurs like 'Chinese virus' and 'Kung flu,' they also denied the impact
their own words were having on innocent Asian Americans who have been terrified by the anti-Asian hate we
have witnessed throughout this pandemic,"" Chu said.
The ADL conducted its research by collecting tweets containing the keywords ""trump,"" ""melania"" and ""first lady,""
pairing them with the terms ""china virus,"" ""plague,"" ""kung flu"" or ""Wuhan."" It also included mentions of
@realdonaldtrump, @potus and @flotus. The civil rights group used those parameters to collect conversations
specifically tied to Trump's diagnosis.
They then compared the volume of mentions in the three days following Trump's Oct. 2 tweet announcing his
diagnosis, and compared it with a baseline of data collected from five hours before the diagnosis.
While the ADL did not cull through all 2.7 million tweets, its researchers analyzed the results from numerous
Twitter users with large followings to observe the sentiment associated with the keywords.
Separately, the group also detected a rise in conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic comments following the
president's diagnosis.
One of the most common conspiracy theories is that a ""New World Order"" or ""NWO"" will surface run by secretive
actors who either gave Trump the virus or plan to assassinate him during his illness, the report said. Other
tweets made anti-Semitic claims such as Trump is a ""crypto Jew"" or a Zionist agent, or that he is a pawn subject
to Jewish interests.",3821
Pandemic stokes worries about disturbances and fuels gun-ownership boom in California,"Blakemore, Erin",Washington Post,2021-01-19,"The pandemic presents an unprecedented danger to human health - and not just because of covid-19. New
research suggests the pandemic has stoked rising worries about violence and fueled gun ownership.
Published in the journal JAMA Network Open, the study relies on data from the 2020 California Safety and WellBeing Survey, which covers topics related to firearm ownership, practices and exposure to violence. The 2,870
California adults surveyed reported rising concern about violence during the pandemic. About 1 in 10 were
concerned someone they know might harm themselves.
About 7 percent of respondents who reported they had experienced unfair treatment believe it occurred because
of the pandemic.
A disproportionate number were Asian Americans, reflecting reports of widespread anti-Asian racism and
xenophobia throughout the pandemic. The advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate reports it received over 2,500
complaints of anti-Asian American discrimination between March and August, including verbal attacks and
potential civil rights violations.
The study also showed new firearm and ammunition purchases during the pandemic in response to concerns
about lawlessness, prisoner releases and even government collapse. The researchers estimate that about
110,000 Californians bought firearms directly in response to the pandemic, 47,000 for the first time.
Although more than half of owners said they store their firearms securely, 1.2 percent - about 55,000 California
firearm owners - keep a loaded firearm unlocked in their home, and half of those live with children or
adolescents.
Why does this matter to public health? The researchers point out firearm ownership's links to harm, from
homicide to suicide to accidental shootings. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, suicide was the
10th leading cause of death in the United States, and firearm deaths accounted for about half of those deaths.
Another 39,740 people died of firearm violence that year.
The researchers say their findings could drive short-term solutions such as community-based violence
interventions and temporary, out-of-home firearm storage. And, they say, those solutions could help address
""other societal shocks that exacerbate persistent structural, economic, and social inequities"" that drive violence.",2296
I'm Asian American. The pandemic showed me why black people feel so unsafe.,"Kim, Regina",Washington Post,2020-07-19,"had faced racism before, but xenophobia driven by the virus made her fear violence for the first time
When the coronavirus started spreading across the United States, triggering a surge in anti-Asian hate crimes, I
began feeling uncharacteristically anxious. As a Korean American, I was used to microaggressions - being
complimented on my English (though I was born and raised in the States), being asked where I really came
from - but this felt different. For the first time in my life, I feared for my physical safety. I feared becoming a
target of violence because of my race.
Sometimes my eyes would well up with tears as I read reports from across the country of Asians and Asian
Americans being assaulted, spat on, stabbed and even burned with chemicals by people who associated them
with the virus. In early March, only a block away from my Manhattan workplace, a Korean woman was punched
in the face by a stranger who said ""You've got coronavirus"" and cursed at her; the woman was taken to the
hospital with a possible dislocated jaw. As the spring went on, I heard about two Asians being stabbed and
another getting severely beaten in racially motivated incidents in my Queens neighborhood.
The pandemic has made me more aware of racism - how it bubbles beneath the surface of everyday life and can
erupt at any time, even in a cosmopolitan place like New York. It also has given me a new sense of some of the anxiety that black people face on a regular basis. One mother recently told NPR about how, upon spotting two
white men laughing with one another, her son commented: ""It must be nice to wake up in the morning and feel
safe, to not be afraid to go out and do what you have to do for the day, to hang out with your friends, not be
afraid of the police. I wonder what that is like."" Though in my case I was more afraid of racist civilians than of
law enforcement, such accounts resonated with me more deeply than before.
I felt nervous going to my local pharmacy or grocery store, afraid that some malicious stranger might accost me
on the sidewalk and harass or harm me. Before stepping outside to run an errand, I would always weigh the
potential trade-offs: Do I really need a new jug of milk? Is it worth the risk? When I did venture out, I became
painfully aware of people's wary glances and nasty stares, or how they walked away when they saw me headed
in their direction. After only a few months of this, I felt exhausted. What would it feel like to deal with it for a
lifetime? And what would it feel like to endure not only random, individual confrontations but systemic
discrimination? Anti-black racism influences matters from housing to the air quality in your neighborhood, from
access to health care to whether your doctor treats you well. It shapes how you are viewed in professional
settings and by police, teachers and bankers. Though the glimpse I got into black people's experience of racism
was eye-opening, my understanding of it was still limited.
As protests against racial inequality and police brutality gathered in New York and nationwide, I received text
messages from some of my Asian friends urging me to stay inside, where it's safe. They told me that Asians
should not get involved in these struggles - that these matters didn't concern us. That if violence were to break
out during the protests, we would end up becoming ""collateral damage.""
I understand where they may have been coming from. Asian Americans occupy a murky space in America's
racial hierarchy: We can't claim white privilege, but we're not consistently or definitively considered people of
color, either, and so sometimes we don't know if we even have the right to raise our voices; we don't know what
our role in the conversation should be. Some people in my community believe that it's natural for us to stay
detached and uninvolved. We're used to being invisible, and that invisibility has often felt safe.
But America's racial narrative does involve us. It created the model-minority myth - the notion that Asian
Americans are successful because we're hard-working, obedient and don't complain - which many within our
community bought into over the years. But that myth is not an honest compliment: The U.S. government used
it to discredit the civil rights movement and to win allies in the Cold War. It's also been wielded against us to
keep Asian Americans in line, to prevent us from entering certain professions, and to pit us against black people
and other people of color. Meanwhile, it was largely because of black activists' efforts during the civil rights
movement that the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965 was passed, removing immigration quotas based
on national origin and ushering in a wave of Asian immigrants. The Black Power Movement also helped spark
Asian American advocacy - in fact, the term ""Asian American"" was coined in 1968 by University of California at
Berkeley students Emma Gee and Yuji Ichioka, who drew inspiration from the Black Power Movement.
As sociology professor Anthony C. Ocampo recently told Time magazine, by taking a stand against anti-black
racism, Asian Americans send an urgent message: ""The same racist logic schemes that are keeping our
communities down might look different in Black communities than they look in Asian American communities, but
it's still the same system"" - one that puts Asian Americans ""in a position where we can't write our own stories in
this country."" For some Asian Americans, taking a stand has meant attending protests. Others have organized
fundraisers for racial justice organizations and bail funds. And many have grappled with how to educate our
relatives and friends, asking them to think about their own experiences with oppression and to draw connections
to America's past and present.
Perhaps the single biggest realization I've had over the past few months is that our experiences dealing with
racism are not merely individual: They're different manifestations of an overarching injustice. The pandemic has
initiated Asian Americans like me into the experience of feeling personally endangered by racism. But though it'd
be a natural first instinct to retreat, to seek refuge in invisibility and silence, our vulnerability should instead
inspire us to reach out - to others in our community, and to people beyond it - so that we can collectively advocate for justice.

"After Floyd's death, rates of depression spike for blacks","Fowers, Alyssa; Wan, William",Washington Post,2020-06-13,"Americans were already struggling with historic levels of mental health problems amid the coronavirus pandemic. Then came the video of George Floyd's death at the hands of
police.
Within a week, anxiety and depression among African Americans shot to higher rates than experienced by any other racial or ethnic group, with 41 percent screening positive
for at least one of those symptoms, data from the Census Bureau shows.
The findings - from a survey launched by the federal government originally intended to study the effects of the novel coronavirus - indicate that the recent unrest,
demonstrations and debate have exacted a disproportionate emotional and mental toll on black and Asian Americans, even as rates of anxiety and depression remain relatively
flat among white Americans and decreased among Latin Americans.
The rate of black Americans showing clinically significant signs of anxiety or depressive disorders jumped from 36 percent to 41 percent in the week after the video of Floyd's
death became public. That represents roughly 1.4 million more people.
Among Asian Americans, those symptoms increased from 28 percent to 34 percent, a change that represents an increase of about 800,000 people.
The data comes from an emergency weekly survey of U.S. households launched by the Census Bureau at the end of April to measure the pandemic's effects on finances,
housing, education and health. In the most recent data release, more than 1 million households were contacted through email and text, and more than 100,000 responded,
creating a robust sample size for the findings. Analysis of the data was conducted by multiple federal agencies including the Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics.
Included in the 20-minute survey - called the Household Pulse Survey - were questions from two screening tools used by doctors to help determine whether patients might have
major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder. The results provide a real-time window into the country's collective mental health.
Data collected in 2019, released two weeks ago by the CDC, allows for the most accurate comparison to date of America's mental health from before the pandemic to after.
And that comparison is stark: Rates of depression and anxiety symptoms have more than tripled since the coronavirus hit.
But the increases have hit black Americans especially hard.
""When we think about the impact of covid-19 among black Americans and other underserved populations - they have had to remain in the workforce or they have felt the effect
of unemployment,"" said Erlanger Turner, a licensed psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University. ""When you add the police killings from the last
couple of weeks, it makes sense that you would see additional stress among the black community.""
The census survey collects data over a six-day period weekly, from Thursday to the following Tuesday. The video of George Floyd's death began circulating widely online May 26,
the last day of data collection for Week 4. The following week, May 28 to June 2, mass protests spread across the country.
In the wake of such incidents - as images keep replaying and debates ignite throughout the country - ""it can feel like it's happening to you over and over,"" said Wizdom Powell,
director of the University of Connecticut's Health Disparities Institute. ""You start seeing symptoms of hyper vigilance, emotional numbing and secondary trauma.""
A 2018 study in the journal Lancet found that following police shootings, African Americans suffer higher levels of psychological distress than white people even when they live
in the same community.
""It's hard for others outside of the community to understand the level to which we feel each others' pain. With the George Floyd killing and other killings, we don't have a
personal connection to those individuals. But it could have been us or someone we know, and that does lead to additional stress and anxiety around these incidents,"" said
Turner, author of ""Mental Health Among African Americans.""
One surprising finding in the new census data was that Asian Americans experienced the largest one-week change in anxiety and depression symptoms of any racial or ethnic
group. Asians had the lowest rates of depression in 2019 - just 3 percent screened positive - but that rate has soared during the pandemic.
For months, since the emergence of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China, Asian Americans have experienced marked racism.
""Given how this pandemic started, with discrimination against Asian Americans, it's not hard to imagine that as the national conversation started turning back to race and racial
violence, you see anxiety and depression start resurfacing,"" Powell said.
Asian Americans have seen a rise in hate crimes and harassment, their businesses have been targeted by vandals and looters, and Asian doctors and nurses have been abused
and physically attacked even as they help the United States fight the coronavirus.
""In my private practice, I've seen a huge uptick,"" said Michi Fu, a psychologist in Los Angeles with expertise in working with Asian American families. ""What worries me about
this increase in trauma and stress are all those who aren't seeking help because Asian Americans are especially less likely to do that when it comes to mental health. Compared
to other ethnic groups, the stigma is just incredibly strong.""
Latin Americans began the pandemic with higher rates of symptoms than all other groups, but those symptoms decreased during the past week. Experts say this may be a
reflection of some measure of relief that after three years of intense focus on immigration and their community during the Trump administration, the attention is turning toward
other groups.
""I remember when 9/11 happened, there was such a focus on Middle Eastern communities, and there were a lot of ethno-cultural communities that were relieved that the focus
was no longer on them,"" said Miguel Gallardo, a psychology professor at Pepperdine University and director of Aliento, the school's center for Latino communities. ""Now, we're
talking about Black Lives Matter, and for some community members, it represents a shift from the focus on immigrants and the Latinx community,"" he said, using the genderneutral term to describe that population.
Gallardo said that for some members of the Hispanic community, symptoms of anxiety and depression may also have been alleviated by joining campaigns that are pushing for
changes in policing.
Experts say the disproportionate effect of the pandemic and racial unrest on black and Asian Americans highlights the need for improving mental health support for those groups
- with better access to health care, awareness campaigns and encouragement to seek help.
Minority communities, experts said, often have the greatest need but the least access to the country's mental health-care system.
""We also need to think beyond just patching up the wounds,"" Powell said. ""You can't just address the trauma. You need to address the cause of the trauma, and that is the
structural and systemic racism in the first place that sparked these protests and everything else we're seeing now.""

Asian American leaders fear conflict with China will fan racist backlash,"Nakamura, David",Washington Post,2021-03-18,"President Biden has sought to blunt a reported surge in anti-Asian bias incidents by ordering the federal government not to use xenophobic language to describe the coronavirus and by calling ""vicious hate crimes"" during the pandemic ""un-American."" 
But Asian American leaders are warning that a deepening geopolitical confrontation between the United States and China is contributing to the heightened suspicion, prejudice and violence against their communities in ways that could continue to intensify even after the pandemic begins to subside.
Advocates called Biden's rhetorical efforts a welcome corrective to President Donald Trump, who railed against the ""China virus"" and ""kung flu."" Yet the broadening conflict among the world's two largest economies - on trade, defense, 5G networks, cybersecurity, the environment, health security and human rights - has contributed to a growing number of Americans calling China the ""greatest enemy"" of the United States, according to a Gallup poll this week. 
In the survey, 45 percent of respondents named China as the top threat, more than twice as many as a year earlier, when the country was ranked on par with Russia. Democrats and Republicans have voiced bipartisan support for a tougher U.S. policy, including economic sanctions on Beijing over cyber-intrusions, human rights violations and crackdowns on democracy in Hong Kong. 
""When America China-bashes, then Chinese get bashed, and so do those who look Chinese. American foreign policy in Asia is American domestic policy for Asians,"" said Russell Jeung, a history professor at San Francisco State University who last year helped found Stop AAPI Hate (AAPI stands for Asian American and Pacific Islanders). The advocacy group has tallied more than 3,000 incidents of bias and hate during the pandemic. 
""The U.S.-China cold war - and especially the Republican strategy of scapegoating and attacking China for the virus - incited racism and hatred toward Asian Americans,"" Jeung said.
A number of violent assaults on Asian Americans over the past two months, including some that went viral after being caught on video, have drawn political and media attention to escalating fears over public safety. The slaying of eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at three Georgia spas on Tuesday sparked demands for an urgent response from authorities. Police arrested Robert Aaron Long, a White man, in connection with the killings and cited as a potential motive Long's interest in eliminating ""sexual temptation.""
Not all of the cases appear to have a link to anger over the pandemic or were necessarily motivated by racial resentment. But advocates said they have collected enough anecdotal evidence through self-reporting portals set up last year by community groups to illustrate that attacks are spiking. 
And they are fearful that the intensifying competition between Washington and Beijing is contributing to scapegoating of Asian Americans in echoes of earlier periods of widespread hostility during geopolitical tumult and heightened nationalism in the United States. 
They pointed to the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 that banned the immigration of Chinese laborers amid national economic anxiety, the internment of more than 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War II, and attacks on mosques and Muslim Americans in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.
""For as long as Asians have been in America, we've been scapegoated, treated as outsiders and seen as untrustworthy. Too often, these prejudices are exploited for political gain,"" said Christopher Lu, who served as White House Cabinet secretary and deputy labor secretary in the Obama administration. ""As troubling as our current situation is, I am concerned that things are going to get much worse as U.S.-China tensions grow.""
Asian American leaders acknowledged the need for the United States to develop a tougher strategy to counter the Chinese Communist Party's influence campaign across the globe. The question, activists said, is how the federal government and elected officials speak publicly about the challenge and how far they go to counter it. 
Trump sought to blame Beijing for the outbreak of the pandemic, employing xenophobic language that was echoed by his supporters and other Republican officials and condemned by Democrats. 
But in April, weeks after the onset of the pandemic, Biden also drew heat from Democratic Congress members and community groups for a campaign advertisement that accused the 45th president of having ""rolled over for the Chinese"" in managing the coronavirus and cast China as a looming threat. 
Biden's campaign apologized for the language and aired a revised version of the ad. But the episode illustrated the intensifying effort of both parties to appear tougher on Beijing. 
""It is clearly a difficult line to walk. However, I do believe there is a way of disagreeing with China's policies without denigrating the Chinese people themselves,"" said Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), chair of the House Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. 
Chu praised Biden for issuing an executive action in January aimed at barring federal agencies from blaming China for the pandemic and instructing the Justice Department to improve data collection on hate crimes. In a prime-time address to the nation last week about his administration's coronavirus response, Biden decried attacks and harassment against Asian Americans who have been ""forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets."" 
""It must stop,"" Biden said. 
White House aides, including domestic policy adviser Susan Rice and senior adviser Cedric L. Richmond, met virtually with Asian American advocacy groups two weeks ago to hear their concerns. They pledged to use the power of the administration to combat violence but offered few specifics, according to activists who participated, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation.
Chu and others have pushed Biden to elevate more Asian Americans to high-level jobs in his administration, noting there is only one Cabinet-level official of East Asian descent, Katherine Tai, who was confirmed Wednesday as U.S. trade representative.
Attorney General Merrick Garland met with advocates on a video call Wednesday that lasted about 45 minutes, telling them he recognized that regardless of whether the Georgia killings were racially motivated, he understood the larger context in which the crime took place and the sense of alarm within the community, according to a person who participated.
Asian American leaders have raised questions about the Justice Department's ""China Initiative"" - launched by the Trump administration in 2018 - to amplify ongoing U.S. government efforts to counter the Chinese government's attempts to steal billions of dollars a year in U.S. intellectual property. 
Advocates have said the program has led to unfair racial profiling of scientists and academics of Chinese descent. They pointed to the case of University of Kansas researcher Franklin Tao, a permanent U.S. resident who was indicted in 2019 and accused of failing to disclose an alleged teaching contract with a Chinese university while conducting federally funded research. His lawyers have denied the charges. 
""Publicly available information suggests at least 60 cases that have been filed had a reference to the China Initiative. Only a quarter of them have actually involved charges of espionage,"" said John C. Yang, executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, which has advocated on behalf of Tao, whose case is pending. Yang's organization has asked the Biden administration to put a moratorium on the program and conduct a review of it.
""This goes to the perpetual foreigner stereotype we always talk about,"" Yang said, ""where in various points in history, we are targeted unfairly.""
Justice Department officials met with Asian American advocates two weeks ago, but they declined to comment on the future of that program. They have pledged to develop new grant programs for local police agencies to report on hate crime data and efforts to translate federal hate crime reporting portals into Chinese and other Asian languages.
At her confirmation hearing last week, Lisa Monaco, Biden's nominee for deputy attorney general, offered credit to the Trump administration for focusing on cyberthreats from China and said she expects to ""double down"" on the strategy. ""This is an area I think we have a great deal more to do,"" she told senators.

"Governor says wife, daughters experienced anti-Asian bias amid pandemic","Author Brockell, Gillian",Washington Post,2021-03-15,"Family and friends have 'been treated pretty terribly,' he tells CNN
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday morning that anti-Asian harassment during
the coronavirus pandemic has been ""a serious problem"" for his wife, Yumi, an immigrant from South Korea, and
her three adult daughters.
""They have felt some discrimination personally,"" he said on Tapper's State of the Union talk show, describing
experiences within his own family and among their close friends, whom he said have ""been treated pretty
terribly.""
""We feel it personally with my daughter, who sort of is sometimes afraid to come visit us,"" Hogan said, ""with
people who had best friends that were being harassed at the grocery store, or being called names, and people
yelling about the 'China virus,' even though they're from Korea and born in America.""
In 2020, reports of hate crimes were down 7 percent nationally but increased 150 percent against people in the
Asian community, according to a study released this month by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism
at California State University at San Bernardino, which examined police records in 16 of the country's largest cities.
Hogan cited the statistic in the CNN interview, calling it ""outrageous"" and ""unacceptable.""
Former president Donald Trump often used the term ""China virus"" when referring to the coronavirus, which
experts say may have helped stoke anti-Asian sentiment during the pandemic.
On Sunday, Hogan thanked President Biden for condemning anti-Asian discrimination in his first prime-time
address Thursday.
""It's something we have to get under control,"" the governor said. ""And I wish more people would be speaking
out. And I appreciate the president's remarks.""
Hogan had expressed similar sentiments on Twitter, posting a photo of himself, the first lady, their children and
grandchildren.
Hogan first met his wife at an art show more than 20 years ago. They married in 2004, with Hogan wearing
traditional Korean garb at the ceremony. Yumi Hogan brought three daughters from her previous marriage. The
blended family is close, and the governor's stepdaughters call him ""Dad.""
As first lady, Yumi has focused on the arts; she is an abstract landscape painter and art professor. At the time of
Hogan's first inauguration in 2015, she was believed to be the nation's first Korean American first lady.

Asian Americans staying absent from classrooms,"Balingit, Moriah; Natanson, Hannah; Chen, Yutao",Washington Post,2021-03-05,"Families fear infection in multigenerational homes, harassment at school
It's happening in well-to-do Pakistani households in the suburbs of Washington and among Chinese restaurant
workers in Philadelphia. It's happening among weary Filipino nurses in Queens, Hmong refugee families in
Minneapolis and in Silicon Valley's Asian American community.
As school buildings start to reopen, Asian and Asian American families are choosing to keep their children
learning from home at disproportionately high rates. They say they are worried about elderly parents in
cramped, multigenerational households, distrustful of promised safety measures and afraid their children will
face racist harassment at school. On the flip side, some are pleased with online learning and see no reason to
risk the health of their family.
In New York City, Asian American children make up the smallest share of children back in classrooms - just
under 12 percent - even though they represent 18 percent of all students. In Tennessee, less than half of Asian
families enrolled in Metro Nashville Public Schools opted for in-person learning, compared with nearly two-thirds
of White children.
In Chicago, two-thirds of White students chose in-person learning, while just a third of Asian, Black and Latino
students decided to head back. And in Fairfax County Public Schools, the largest district in Virginia, just over 30
percent of Asian families selected face-to-face instruction this spring, by far the smallest return rate reported
among any racial group.
The academic consequences could be devastating, warned Mya Baker of education nonprofit TNTP, which works
with school districts across the country to boost achievement among low-income and minority students. This is
especially true in communities of immigrant and refugee Asian families, she said, who are often overlooked due
to the pervasiveness of the ""model minority myth.""
In reality, many Asian communities face the same kinds of challenges that hold back Black and Latino students,
including poverty, language barriers and under-resourced schools. In New York City, more than 1 in 5 Asians live
in poverty, the second highest of any racial or ethnic group, according to city data.
According to the Pew Research Center, nearly 30 percent of Asians in the United States live in intergenerational
households, almost double the percentage of White households. And Asian Americans represent the most
economically divided racial group in the nation, with the success of the affluent obscuring the plight of the least
fortunate.
""Everyone makes assumptions that, 'Oh, Asian kids are doing better with virtual learning,' "" Baker said. ""The
reality is we're talking about families living in multigenerational households, families where English is not spoken
at home, so we're increasing barriers for those students who are already not performing well.""
Baker said that is why it is essential for schools to work doubly hard to reach Asian families - about a third of
Asians in the United States have limited English proficiency - and to reassure them that their children will not be
targeted.
In Virginia and Maryland, Asian American students seem to be suffering smaller academic losses than their
Black and Latino classmates. But in other places, like Minneapolis, where the Southeast Asian refugee
community faces steep rates of poverty, students appear to be losing ground as fast or even faster than other
students of color. In fall 2019, about 7 percent of grades given to Asian students were F's. That percentage
more than quadrupled - to 30 percent - in the fall of 2020, according to the Sahan Journal, which reports on
Minneasota's immigrant communities.
Anxiety about being targeted
Many Asian Americans have been anxious of being targeted after President Donald Trump used racist language
to describe the coronavirus. Critics warned his repeated use of phrases like ""Chinese virus"" and ""kung flu"" could
escalate attacks on Asian Americans, who reported rising instances of harassment. Now, a spate of high-profile
attacks on Asian Americans has many in the community on edge.
In New York City, a Filipino man was slashed with a box cutter on the subway, an Asian woman was punched in
the face on a subway platform, and another woman was shoved to the ground in Flushing, a predominantly
Asian community in Queens. In Los Angeles, a man at a bus stop was beaten with his own cane, and a Thai
grandfather died after being pushed to the ground in San Francisco. It's unclear whether race motivated all the
crimes, but the incidents, combined with increasing reports of harassment and bullying, have heightened
anxiety in many communities.
The ripple effects among families weighing whether to send their children back are far-reaching.
In New York City, Liz OuYang, a Columbia University adjunct professor and civil rights attorney who specializes
in combating hate crimes, said some Asian American families are fearful about setting foot outside their homes.
OuYang, who directs an annual hate crime prevention art project for the nonprofit OCA-NY Asian Pacific American Advocates, said parents and kids have shared stories of strangers harassing them, yelling at them
to ""speak English"" or ""go back to your home country.""
It has made some families fearful of sending their children on solo commutes to school. So instead, they keep
them home, learning remotely.
In New York City's Chinatown, a school principal said one mother moved her child from in-person learning to
remote learning after she and her child were harassed on the subway. Some families are so worried about
leaving their apartments that the school has shelled out funds to ship or hand-deliver supplies and packets to
them.
Parents have relayed the same fears in Philadelphia. Anna Perng, co-founder of the Chinatown Disability
Advocacy Project, said parents reported their children were being harassed on city buses. Then, over the
summer, police arrested a homeless woman for attacking a pregnant woman in Chinatown, calling her a slur
and punching her in the face.
That sent the anxiety in Philadelphia's Asian American communities into overdrive, Perng said, and now
threatens to deprive them of access to school-provided resources they badly need.
""Families have told me they're afraid to go to the school district to get things like worksheets, learning
supplies and the free meals the school district has been handing out since the pandemic started,"" Perng said.
Lisa Liu, whose two children attend Montgomery County Public Schools in Maryland, said she saw little reason
to send them back to classrooms when virtual learning seemed to be working well for them. But fear that
they would face harassment also played into her decision.
""Maybe if they go back, the other kids will say, 'You're the reason we didn't go to school for a year,' "" Liu said.
""I don't want my kids to experience hatred.""
Many in medical fields
But it is not just harassment that families worry about. Asian Americans are overrepresented in medical
fields, making up 6 percent of the population but 18 percent of the nation's doctors and 10 percent of its
nurse practitioners. It means they are more likely to have had firsthand experience with the virus.
Suzanne Lirazan, a 30-year-old nurse from the Philippines who lives in Queens, has seen the devastation of
the pandemic firsthand. She works as a private nurse, and in April the patient she was caring for fell ill after
contracting the coronavirus. She was at his bedside as he took his final breaths. Then she and the rest of the
household fell ill. She was unable to see her 9-year-old son, Gabriel De La Cruz, for an entire month as she
recovered and quarantined.
Lirazan worries her son could bring home the virus from school, a prospect that would not only be dangerous
for her, but for her patients, too.
""It's the fear of him getting sick, and transmission-wise, I don't want to get sick and transmit it with my
patients,"" Lirazan said. ""My son, he's very social, he likes to study in school. But I just can't bring myself to
bring him there.""
Lirazan said that sentiment is common in Filipino communities in New York and New Jersey, where many work
in health-care in jobs that put them in close contact with patients.
Preexisting conditions
For Nancy Lin, a Philadelphia mother of two who was laid off from her restaurant job when the pandemic
struck, the decision to keep her children remote was driven by something else: the school building. According to her dispatches with other parents over the messaging app WeChat, many other Chinese families are
making the same decision.
They had complaints about the condition of the school even before the pandemic, of mold in the basement,
that bathrooms were dirty, and that heating and cooling systems were not in working order. They are the
same factors that are keeping other families of color - and teachers - out of school buildings.
Their concerns are not unfounded. An investigative series in 2017 by the Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily
News found widespread issues with asbestos and paint laced with lead. When the teachers union pushed
the school system to delay the start date of in-person classes, its leader cited the district's ""absolutely
abysmal track record when it comes to addressing health and safety.""
At Hmong International Academy in Minneapolis, Principal Jamil Payton said only a third of students in
prekindergarten through fifth grade have come back to the school building since they reopened last month.
The school serves a mix of students from the city's refugee communities - Hmong, Laotian, Cambodian and
Sudanese students. There were fewer than 100 students in the building the last week of February, a group
whose demographics roughly matched the school's.
The Hmong community has been hard-hit by the coronavirus. In June, Marny Xiong, a Hmong woman who
chaired of the St. Paul Board of Education, succumbed to the virus at the age of 31, devastating the
Hmong community. Xiong had worked as an administrator at Hmong International Academy and her loss
was felt deeply.
""We were hit like a ton of bricks by the passing of this staff member who was so beloved in our building
and our community,"" Payton said. He believes it is contributing to the reluctance of Hmong families to send
their children back to school buildings.
Swapping information
The decision for almost any family to send their children back to school can be wrenching, as they attempt
to balance the benefits of sending their children back to school with the risks - all while the death toll from
the pandemic mounts. So many are relying on parents from their own communities, swapping information
in group chats to make decisions.
Mehvish Ali, who is Pakistani American, had a lot to weigh when trying to decide whether to send her two
sons back to school in Loudoun County, a Northern Virginia suburb. Her oldest son, a seventh-grader, was
eager to get back to school to see his friends. But he also has a medical condition that makes him more
susceptible to the virus.
She is close with her neighbors, most of whom are Indian American, and her children are friends with their
children. The group chat had become a key source of support and information during the pandemic.
On WhatsApp, the consensus was clear.
""Everybody in the neighborhood that I know of said they were doing distance learning,"" Ali said. It made
the decision easier for her and for her son, who learned his friends would also be staying home from
school.
When it came time for Filipino American Julius Paras to decide whether to send his child back to school
outside San Jose, he and his wife, who is Chinese American, decided to convene a Zoom meeting with
relatives nearby. Many of them had come together as a pandemic pod, allowing the parents to split childcare duties and the cousins to continue to see each other. They realized sending their children back to
classrooms could shatter their support system and possibly endanger his in-laws, who they visit for socially
distanced picnics in the elderly couple's driveway. 
""We want our children to grow up not just with their aunts and uncles but also with their grandparents.
It's just this affinity for multigenerational living that comes from my Filipino culture and from my wife's
Chinese culture,"" Paras said. ""When we thought about how to prioritize all of this, it came down to, 'Who
is our family? How do we look out for them?' And we decided home is what's safest.""",12499
Anti-Asian attacks must no longer be minimized,"Dvorak, Petula",Washington Post,2021-03-19,"After Dylan Adler was screamed at, chased and sucker-punched by a stranger on a New York street last year, he had almost convinced himself it was just bad luck. Nothing to do with the color of his skin.
""But I talked with other friends,"" said Adler, 24, who checked in with his fellow Asian Americans about the attack, which happened at the very start of the global pandemic. ""They had other incidents, too.""
That was also the start of an alarming increase in hate attacks against Asian Americans. There were about 3,800 recorded over the past year, from slurs on the street and stabbings to vandalism at Asian American-owned businesses. It went up 150 percent in 2020, according to research by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University at San Bernardino.
In Columbia, Md., last month, three businesses were vandalized and ransacked on Lunar New Year, the most important holiday in Chinese culture. The criminals ignored the Cheesecake Factory and Chipotle nearby but hit Urban Hot Pot, Kung Fu Tea and Bonchon. Police said they were investigating them as commercial burglaries, not hate crimes. The community felt differently.
""We are deeply saddened that during these difficult times our community is filled with such hatred and division,"" wrote Alexis Chen, a family member of some of the store owners, on a GoFundMe to raise money for a group working to stop hate crimes. ""As an Asian American establishment, the fact that these attacks came on Lunar New Year, such a celebrated time of year for us, is heartbreaking.""
The attacks have been escalating all year, as arguments over the pandemic were twisted into anti-Asian hatred, led by the chief flamethrower, former president Donald Trump, who joked, even as thousands were dying from the virus, that it was the ""kung flu.""
Adler, who is an actor, comedian and musician, said part of why he didn't at first register that the attack against him ""was a hate crime"" was because of how little he's read about crimes against Asians.
It is an invisible hatred, largely ignored.
""It's very hard, culturally, for many Asian Americans to self-advocate,"" said Rumi Matsuyama, a hockey mom I know from my son's team who lives in Hyattsville, Md. 
Matsuyama was one of the parents who tirelessly advocated against hatred in the largely White hockey community after an incident involving a Black player. And I wrote about it, interviewing the Black players who had been taunted, howled at and called the n-word on the ice.
Another Asian American mom quietly thanked me for shining a light on any kind of hatred, one that her son consistently faced in years of playing but never reported.
But none of us parents dwelled on the hatred that Asian American players faced. 
At a game two years ago, I remember an all-White team on Maryland's Eastern Shore told one of the Asian American players on my son's team to ""Go back to China."" 
The boy didn't tell his mom about it until days later, and the other kids, including my own, didn't report this to the grown-ups at the game.
There were similar incidents at other rinks, with other teams. And they rarely garnered sanctions or outrage.
Adler said he was told at a young age that these types of insults weren't about hatred.
""I almost gaslit myself into thinking it wasn't racist,"" he said. ""White people have directly told me that racism against Asians doesn't exist. I didn't even register things that were racist as racism.""
He grew up in California yet never heard in school about the nation's shameful past when it came to Asian Americans.
""I learned about Japanese internment from my Japanese family members who were interned during World War II, not from my history teachers,"" he said. ""If that's not white supremacy, I don't know what is.""
Matsuyama said that she and some of her fellow Asian Americans aren't vocal when it comes to themselves.
""It feels selfish,"" she said, when there are more dire attacks against other groups.
But this week, six Asian women at Asian spas were slaughtered in Georgia by a shooter who saw the places as a ""temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate,"" according to authorities. 
He didn't go to the Pink Pony, the Blue Flame Club or the Stroker's Lounge in Atlanta, strip joints that aren't primarily Asian. He went to the places where he could gun down middle-aged Asian women.
It may have been about sex or sexism, too. But the shooter made a very intentional decision about where his bull's eye was going to be.
""While the details of the shootings are still emerging, the broader context cannot be ignored,"" Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta said in a statement. ""The shootings happened under the trauma of increasing violence against Asian Americans nationwide, fueled by white supremacy and systemic racism.""
On Thursday, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing to address the rise of hate crimes against Asian Americans. Lawmakers asked their colleagues to tone down the rhetoric that can fuel attacks.
The fixation on China, the punchlines about the ""Wuhan virus"" or ""kung flu,"" are emboldening bigots, they said.
""Your president and your party and your colleagues can talk about issues with any other country that you want, but you don't have to do it by putting a bull's eye on the back of Asian Americans across this country, on our grandparents, on our kids,"" Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) said. 
""Our community is bleeding,"" Meng said. ""We've been in pain and we've been screaming out for help.""
And the rest of America can no longer say we don't hear them.

'I am a target. That is the reality.',"Heller, Karen",Washington Post,2021-03-30,"Tran Nguyen Wills's family has long worked in nails. Her mother and other relatives who moved to the United States after the 1975 fall of Saigon found employment in a beauty industry that's open to immigrants with limited English but involves constant exposure to noxious chemicals, with modest remuneration.
""They worked for us so we could do something else,"" says Wills, 39, on the phone from Denver. ""There was almost a shame of what they did, which I felt. I hope my mom knows it's not a shame.""
The oldest of six, Wills did not heed her parents' wishes. She went big into nails, opening two Base Coat Nail Salons in Colorado, 13 more nationwide in partnership with Nordstrom, her nontoxic polish sold at two regional Whole Foods. Wills promotes safe products and fair labor practices, correcting the treatment experienced by her family and fellow Asian American workers.
The pandemic devastated small-business owners like Wills, who was forced to shutter two salons in Southern California and saw revenue plummet 80 percent. ""All of our lives fell apart,"" says Wills, a mother of four.
For many Asian Americans, it has also been a long, hard year of hate, hurt by ""China virus"" and ""Kung flu"" references uttered by former president Donald Trump, incessantly repeated in conservative media and accompanied by an escalation of hate incidents, almost 3,800 from March 2020 through February, according to a Stop AAPI Hate national study. Experts believe that most hate crimes against Asian Americans are not reported.
Then came the mass shootings in Atlanta, which targeted three Asian spas, leaving eight people dead.
Now, Wills and others in the nail industry are in shock and grieving for the victims, six of whom are women of Asian descent. Salons are a service field dominated by Asian American women who are similarly vulnerable targets, and many workers fear for their safety. They worry about whether to speak out - and what can be done.
To Wills, Atlanta was not a matter of if but when. ""Before I read past the headline, I knew what had happened. I knew it was going to be Asian American women who were killed,"" she says.
""I saw my own face, my daughters, my mother, my grandmothers, my aunties, my sisters, my staff, my friends,"" she posted on Instagram. ""I am profoundly sad, scared, furious with rage and simply just heart broken.""
Masks do not shield her identity. ""My face is Asian. It doesn't matter what I own or what I do,"" she says. ""I am a target. That is the reality. I'm terrified for me. I'm terrified for my workers."" She starts to quietly weep.
""I've had people move away from me in stores to another line,"" she says. One client requested a nail technician who wasn't Asian American. She was told to get her nails polished elsewhere.
""I still feel very invisible in an industry dominated by Asian American women. I get left out of conversations,"" Wills says. Until it was called out earlier this year on social media, Nailpro magazine didn't include a single Asian American on its 14-member advisory board. The industry is three-quarters immigrant - and 76 percent of that group is Asian, according to a 2018 study, and predominantly Vietnamese in California. 
""Most of our culture tells us to put your head down and keep moving forward and stay out of the limelight. They don't want the attention. They just don't want the negativity,"" Wills says.
Since the shootings, she has placed additional Mace canisters in her salons. Wills restricted patronage to appointments only, with no foot traffic to purchase products, which will further reduce revenue. She's already operating at 50 percent occupancy, following state guidelines.
Wills is also considering active-shooter training for her staff. In eight years of operating nail salons, this was never on her to-do list.
Her escalating fears are shared by other Asian Americans in her industry. Khanh Tran has long begged his mother, an Oakland resident and Vietnamese refugee, to retire from doing nails. The chemicals, the physical labor.
She ""has always been scared of the world, always worried about bad things happening. She always told us to keep our head down and don't pay attention to any of this,"" says Tran, 27, a computer hardware technician.
During the pandemic, the Bay Area has been besieged by anti-Asian American attacks, several of them violent. Days after the shootings, Tran posted a tweet that received more than 105,000 likes: ""Was told that my mom is finally gonna stop doing nails and retire. Not because she's 65. Not because she can't stand the ammonia/fumes. Not because she has arthritis and back aches, but because she's scared to work after what happened in Atlanta.""
Few women become wealthy by doing nails. Technicians made a median of $12.39 an hour in 2019, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, $25,770 a year. Last year, when the pandemic forced salons to close for months, was surely worse.
""It's been a really intense and traumatic year for the nail industry. There have been instances of vandalism. One of our members' salon was broken into last week after the murders. It's hard not to see the connection,"" says Lisa Fu, executive director of the advocacy group California Healthy Nail Salon Collaborative. 
""A lot of issues related to nail workers is about being ignored and being made invisible. My work has been dedicated to making this community visible,"" Fu says. 
""The level of anxiety continues to grow and grow. Asian spas and salons are easier targets,"" often identifiable by exterior signage in other languages, Fu adds. ""Now, they're going to be afraid for the their lives.""
Hong Dinh, 38, moved to the United States from Saigon in 2003. She's helped support herself and three children doing nails for 15 years. The dream was to open her own salon with her sister in San Jose - which she realized this month, her grand opening on March 15.
The next day, the killing rampage occurred in Atlanta.
The following day, Dinh ordered a steel front door for protection and closed the salon.
It will remain locked until the door can be installed and she feels safe that her salon won't be a target.
""I'm sad. I'm sad for the whole world,"" says Dinh, through an interpreter. ""I think this is the beginning of the attacks. People are mad because of covid. There's anger in them. They've been stuck at home for a year now. It also depends where they get their news from.""
Rachel Yoon, 59, who immigrated from Korea, owns a salon in Manhattan's Washington Heights. Nail salons have long been places where women of varied backgrounds gather. The majority of Yoon's clientele are Dominican. They've been great. But she's heard unseemly comments, often from White people who are strangers.
Outside the salon, she attempts to blend in. ""I feel, thankfully, when we are wearing masks, sometimes people can't distinguish. Sometimes they can. It's definitely something you feel in the air,"" she says on the phone, driving from her home in Queens to her salon. ""I worry about my niece, my sisters, in the subways. I'm always afraid.""
She sticks to her routine and feels relatively safe. ""I tell my kids if someone approaches you and says something bad, just ignore them. You cannot confront them,"" says Yoon, who has two grown daughters. ""I'm not going to any places I'm not familiar with. I'm being careful until this thing goes away. Everyone is warning each other, 'don't look at someone in the eye.' ""
Wills, in Denver, feels something else must be done. Let Atlanta be instructive. Look at the increase in violent incidents. On March 18, two days after the shootings, Xiao Zhen Xie, 75, was brutally beaten in San Francisco but fought back her attacker. A GoFundMe campaign launched by her grandson has raised nearly $1 million dollars; the family plans to donate almost all of it, less Xie's medical expenses, to combat racism in the community. 
""I feel like I have to be more outspoken. To tell people, 'Don't forget about me,' "" Wills says. 
She's talking. Wills is sharing her anger and frustrations on social media and in her community. She's considering running for public office, possibly the state legislature, where she isn't represented by people who look like her or share her experiences. 
Keeping her head down isn't in Wills's nature and, as she will tell you, staying quiet isn't working.

A new urgency for college students' mental health,"Lumpkin, Lauren",Washington Post,2021-03-31,"Jesse Brownell said she felt lost last spring, when the coronavirus pandemic upended her freshman year at Dartmouth College. But in the months that followed, the 19-year-old regained her footing. She moved into a house near campus with friends this school year and restarted practices with the women's squash team.
Then, earlier this month, she contracted the coronavirus and had to spend more than a week in isolation housing. She couldn't be around friends and was barred from playing sports. Alone, she consumed herself with schoolwork.
""I felt like I was spiraling,"" Brownell said. She says she doesn't think she'll feel comfortable being alone for a while: ""I just didn't expect the mental impact. I definitely am still feeling a little more mentally down, mentally fuzzy.""
Across the country, some school leaders and experts say the pandemic has brought new urgency to a mental health crisis that had been unraveling on college campuses for years. From social isolation to heightened feelings of inadequacy, students say it has made it harder to concentrate on school and put a strain on families and friendships.
Young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 for years have struggled disproportionally with mental illness compared with older groups, and experts cite such underlying factors as high expectations, social media and financial pressures. Now, evidence shows college students experienced higher rates of anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation in 2020 than in 2019.
Despite the promises of vaccines and a return to normal in the fall, students are still stressed, overwhelming campus counseling centers with requests for treatment. Unable to see most students in person, school counselors have responded by developing self-help tools and hosting virtual therapy sessions.
Many students, whether they've contracted the virus or not, are reeling from the last year of uncertainty and wonder when they'll recover.
'What am I doing wrong?' 
When senior Cameron Nolan returned to Morehouse College for the spring semester, he was not the person he was a year ago, when he hurriedly packed his belongings and moved back home with his mom in Jackson, Miss.
Nolan had just been elected student body president at the Atlanta college when the pandemic took hold in the United States. Morehouse closed its campus and, suddenly, the 21-year-old could not lead in the way he had imagined.
""I'm such an in-your-face, extroverted leader,"" said Nolan, an economics major. ""I was at a loss. I literally lost the human connection, and, for a moment, I had no clue how I still wanted to make my goals come true.""
Nolan picked up a job at Walmart and managed to stay on top of his schoolwork, but being away from the life he built at school was tough, he said. In high school, he worked hard to secure the scholarships, test scores and GPA he needed to succeed at Morehouse.
""All that felt like it was in vain when you have to go back to your hometown,"" he said.
Nolan said he started crying more at home, just to release his pent-up emotions. Morehouse offers counseling and other services, but Nolan said he coped by keeping in touch with his friends from school, what Nolan calls his ""band of brothers.""
""Black men have to be hypermasculine at all times,"" Nolan said. ""It is perfectly okay to feel your emotions. It is perfectly okay to be sad.""
He also spent a lot of time journaling, anxiously outlining his future for when he could finally restart his life. Returning home made Nolan feel like his life had stopped but, online, it seemed like others were still moving. He would scroll through Instagram and see people taking trips, getting new jobs and buying cars.
""Although those things are positive experiences, you're looking at yourself like, 'What am I doing wrong?' "" Nolan said. ""When you have this overload of positivity, you always feel like you're behind.""
What Nolan was doing - scrolling and comparing - isn't unusual, said Ryan Patel, a psychiatrist in Ohio State University's counseling center and chair-elect of the American College Health Association's mental health section. The popularity of social media is one of the factors leading to higher rates of anxiety among young people and increasing the pressure they feel to achieve.
""This is the first generation of students that have spent their entire adolescence on smartphones and social media and things like that,"" Patel said. ""Especially with those kinds of technologies, they may be comparing their average self to the shining moments on social media, and falsely thinking that everybody is like that in all aspects of their lives.""
The perils of isolation 
Grace Zopelis feels a twinge of disappointment when she scrolls through social media and sees her classmates hanging out in small groups outside of school.
The American University freshman had high hopes for college. She went to high school in a tiny Connecticut town and didn't have many friends. The pandemic disrupted her senior year - she graduated in a drive-through ceremony and, as salutatorian, recorded her speech in an empty library. By the time summer vacation started, she was burned out.
AU, like many universities, told incoming students the campus would partially reopen in the fall after shuttering last March. But as conditions changed, the school announced in July it would operate online and close the residence halls.
""The one thing keeping me from absolutely losing my mind was just taken away,"" Zopelis remembers thinking. She abandoned her hopes of living in a dorm and found an apartment about a mile from campus.
She's made connections with a few other students but, overall, the 19-year-old said she's felt lonely and overwhelmed by the demands of school. She doesn't expect to maintain the 4.0 GPA she had in high school.
""I'm this recluse living in my apartment by herself,"" Zopelis said.
AU reopened some residence halls this month, but many students had tried to replicate communal living in nearby apartment buildings, houses and even hotels - forming friendships in the process.
Zopelis, who decided over the summer to live on her own, didn't realize she would be missing so much.
""It's been kind of tough,"" she said. ""I feel like I'm missing out on a lot, socially.""
The isolation Zopelis and other students are experiencing feels unnatural, said Michael R. Lovell, president of Marquette University in Milwaukee.
""College is the most social time of your life,"" Lovell said. ""When you are isolated in a pandemic, it's very, very difficult for students to navigate a time when they do feel pressure and stress.""
Counselors at AU have offered services to students including anonymous mental health screenings, virtual workshops and group therapy sessions. But, wary about pursuing counseling, Zopelis is trying to manage the feelings on her own. She adopted a siamese cat named Toby, which she said has helped.
""I don't know if I'm going to have a positive experience or not,"" Zopelis said about counseling. ""It's hard to open up about personal issues, especially with someone you don't know.""
An outlet is gone 
Brownell, 19, didn't seek mental health services, either. Dartmouth's counseling center offered resources during the sophomore's 10-day stint in isolation housing, but she said she felt uneasy about discussing her mental health with the school.
Instead, she relied on phone calls with her girlfriend, friends and family to cope with the mental strain that came with being kept inside for days on end. Brownell doesn't know how she contracted the virus, but there was an outbreak on campus in late February and early March, and she was among those sickened. Then, she was rushed away to isolation, bringing only a backpack and laptop, along with some clothes, toiletries and an essential oils diffuser.
She sustained her connection to the outside world through online classes and daily conversations with a campus nurse. Otherwise, there was little to do, so Brownell buried herself in school work.
""I felt guilty when I wasn't doing schoolwork in isolation,"" she said, adding that she felt more pressure than normal to excel academically. ""It made me feel inadequate as a student.""
Brownell is used to Ivy League expectations but, as an extrovert, relieves that stress by spending time with other people. Suddenly, that outlet was missing. Unable to go outdoors, she saw other people only when she stepped outside her room to retrieve meals from a common area inside the isolation dorm.
Brownell, who plans to major in government and art history, said she became lost in her thoughts. She was worried about the toll the virus would take on her health and nervous about falling behind in school.
While in isolation, she was battling symptoms - bad headaches and fatigue - as well as looming deadlines and loneliness. The entire ordeal has had lasting effects.
""My anxiety about schoolwork is definitely still raised,"" she said.
The challenges came amid a particularly challenging year on the Hanover, N.H., campus of about 6,600 students. In November, freshman Beau DuBray died by suicide, the campus newspaper, the Dartmouth, reported. Another first-year student, Connor Tiffany, died ""unexpectedly"" on March 14, school officials said.
""It's been rough on everyone,"" Brownell said.
'It's demoralizing' 
For Patrick Peralta, a government and politics major at the University of Maryland at College Park, the last 12 months have produced a different type of anxiety - one that can be harder to describe.
Peralta, who is part of U-Md.'s Asian American Student Union, has monitored the unprovoked attacks against Asians and Asian Americans: A man's face was slashed on a subway train, a woman was mugged and injured near her home, an 84-year-old man was pushed violently and later died.
The U-Md. student organization has been vocal on social media about the rise in anti-Asian violence, condemning the attacks and vandalization of Asian-owned businesses. But, the students warned, ""words aren't nearly enough.""
Then, a gunman opened fire on three Atlanta-area spas, leaving eight people - six of whom were Asian women - dead.
""We're anxious and we're terrified of what's going to happen to us and our families,"" Peralta said. ""We live in this constant state of precarity, and this perpetual state of fear because we don't know what's going to happen to us.""
Sagar Matharu, another AASU member, said racism and the anxiety that comes with it have been part of his life for as long as he can remember. At his high school in Frederick, Md., Matharu said someone he once called a friend said he was ""dirty"" and accused him of having a disease.
""That's something that really crushed my mental health for a very long time,"" said Matharu, who is Indian American. The experience made him feel lonely and betrayed. ""That loneliness translated into anxiety, depression, a whole myriad of mental health consequences.""
The recent spa attacks unearthed the feelings Matharu had in high school. But his community at U-Md. keeps them from becoming overwhelming.
Separated by the pandemic, grieving has been relegated to Zoom.
Students also are supporting each other through traumatic events via text, instead of face-to-face. It has made a tense year even more strenuous, as students of color deal with waves of violence and social upheaval. Black students made similar sacrifices last summer as the world reacted to the police killing of George Floyd and demands for justice for Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery.
""It's demoralizing,"" Matharu said. ""It hurts. But when I do talk about it amongst my community, I don't get that feeling of loneliness that I once got.""
Moving through crisis 
On campuses across the country, counseling center staff are ""busier than ever,"" Patel said. Not only are more students requesting help, but their needs are more varied.
The pandemic also introduced the unique challenge of delivering mental health care across state lines. When students scattered to their homes across the country, on-campus health providers suddenly faced a hodgepodge of licensure laws that determined where they could and couldn't practice. Dozens of states have relaxed their restrictions, but 60 percent of students still say the pandemic has made it more difficult to access mental health care, surveys show.
To fill in the gaps, counselors are producing self-help videos, sharing advice on social media and using computer-assisted therapy programs that can be just as effective as in-person treatment, Patel said.
Joan Gabel, president of the University of Minnesota, is ramping up an effort to bring together the five campuses that make up the state university system to understand the mental health crisis through data and research.
The idea for the initiative came around the time Gabel arrived at the university in 2019, when she consistently heard from students that they needed more mental health support.
""That was almost three years ago, and it has only worsened,"" Gabel said. Officials within the university system hope to develop a framework that can be replicated at other institutions.
""This isn't an area for competition. We want all our students to be successful,"" Gabel said. ""When students are well, particularly when their mental health is well, they persist better.""
Leaders at Marquette University are also trying to learn from the pandemic and the way it has affected students. Some of the measures installed in recent months, including efforts to train students to identify the signs of a mental health crisis in one another and deploying counselors into classrooms to share resources, have had a positive impact, Lovell said.
Officials also scattered mental health days throughout the semester, when classes are canceled and professors are discouraged from assigning work.
""It's really important for us to provide resources and tools for students so they don't get to that point where we're in crisis,"" Lovell said. ""The pandemic has really extenuated the pressures we feel to help students with mental health.""

"Asian teenager verbally harassed, spat at outside Fairfax middle school","Natanson, Hannah; Jouvenal, Justin",Washington Post,2021-03-26,"It's the third incident of racist verbal abuse this year, his father said
Four teenagers verbally harassed an Asian teenager and spat in his direction outside a Northern Virginia middle school this week, Fairfax County police said Thursday.
The incident took place on the campus of Longfellow Middle School in Fairfax around 6:20 p.m. Monday, according to the father of the Asian teen, who asked that he not be named to protect his family's privacy. The father reported the incident to Fairfax County police and to officials with Fairfax County Public Schools, where his son is enrolled. 
His son, who is 15, was walking to practice soccer at a field near Longfellow by himself on Monday, which he often does. He paused to watch a group of kids playing baseball nearby and was just leaving when four teenagers, whom he did not recognize, approached, his father said. 
The boys began hissing insults. ""What are you f---ing looking at with your small eyes?"" one asked, the 15-year-old told his father.
The teen told his father another in the group added: ""You should go back to your own country.""
The Asian student told his father at least two of the teenagers - the most aggressive ones - were White, and the other two appeared to be multiracial. Police said they range in age from 17 to 19. 
The harassment outside Longfellow comes as racism and assaults against Asian Americans are spiking nationwide amid anti-Asian sentiment related to the pandemic - fueled, many argue, by the racist rhetoric of former president Donald Trump, who referred to the coronavirus as the ""China virus"" and the ""kung flu."" Fear in Asian communities hit new highs after shootings in the Atlanta area claimed the lives of eight people, including six Asian women, earlier this month. 
In the Longfellow incident, one of the teenagers spat at the Asian student, and ""it hit right in front of my son's shoes,"" his father said. Another began to get closer, but his son backed away. The encounter lasted about two minutes, and his son emerged unhurt physically, the father said. 
After discussing the incident with friends and Longfellow Middle School's assistant principal, who urged him to report it to police, the teen's father filed a report on Wednesday. Fairfax County police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said detectives are working to determine the harassing teenagers' identities. FCPS spokeswoman Helen Lloyd said officials with the school system of 180,000 are ""investigating"" if the youths are system students. She noted that the incident took place outside of school hours.
Jim Patrick, the principal of Longfellow, and Ellen Reilly, the principal of nearby McLean High School, wrote a joint message to families notifying them of the attack and denouncing anti-Asian hatred. They asked parents and students to report any racist acts to school principals or police. 
""We are committed to ensuring safe spaces for all of our students and interrupting any experience that would cause pain and trauma as a result of racialized . . . violence,"" Patrick and Reilly wrote.
The climate of terror and hatred has led some Asian parents to keep their children learning virtually - even as other students head back into classrooms that were shuttered for a year during the pandemic - because they worry children might be targeted inside schools or walking to and from campus. Although happening everywhere in the country, the trend is particularly pronounced in Fairfax County, where just over 30 percent of Asian families selected in-person learning for the spring. 
That rate was by far the lowest reported among any racial group.
Asked about the Fairfax school system's response to the incident at Longfellow, spokeswoman Lloyd pointed to a statement the district published in response to the Georgia massacre. The statement noted that ""misinformation and xenophobic language"" have led to targeting of Asian students and families within the county. 
""It is our responsibility to ensure that all people are treated with dignity and humanity in our schools,"" the statement reads. ""These behaviors are more than being unkind and will not be tolerated.""
When asked whether reports of anti-Asian bullying have increased in Fairfax schools recently, Lloyd said, ""We haven't seen a noticeable rise."" Guglielmi of the Fairfax County police said his department has not seen ""a major uptick"" in crime against Asian Americans.
Guglielmi said police are concerned there could be underreporting of such incidents.
The father of the harassed teen said it is not the first time his son has experienced anti-Asian comments. Twice before over the past year, adults saw him practicing soccer alone on fields in McLean and hurled racist comments. 
An elderly man told him not to practice there anymore because he would spread the coronavirus. In a separate incident, two people in their 30s or 40s told the 15-year-old to stay away from them because he might infect them with the virus. 
Still, the father said his son has reiterated time and again, after every racist episode, that he doesn't feel too bothered. 
But his father wonders if he's telling the full truth. And he is wondering whether he should continue letting his son practice soccer on his own.
""It's a favorite place for him, he felt safe,"" his father said of the Longfellow soccer field.
He added after a pause: ""But it's not safe anymore.""
As news of the harassment spread on social media, some Asian American families in the neighborhood were forced to reassess a community they had always seen as welcoming. 
Mary Gordon, an Asian American mother of a student at Longfellow, said she learned about the incident when she checked Nextdoor and saw posts detailing the harassment. Her eighth-grade son attends the school, and she has a fourth-grader enrolled at a Fairfax elementary school. Both children are biracial, she said. 
She was aware of the wave of anti-Asian hate but never expected it to hit this close to home. 
""I am 47 years old. I was born here in this country, grew up [here], and I have to say, for the first time in my life, I am genuinely scared,"" Gordon said. 
Gordon said she is now planning to have ""tough conversations about race"" with her children. She will do her best to explain why racist attacks happen and how they should respond. She wants to urge her kids to ""always speak up"" for their rights, but she is afraid that advice might get them hurt. 
She has not told her daughter, her youngest child, about the Longfellow incident because she does not want to scare the girl. But she did tell her son, the eighth-grader. She stuck close to the facts, speaking as neutrally as possible. 
""Okay,"" he said, and went back to watching a video.
But ""I could tell in his eyes that it was a little painful for him,"" Gordon said.
She hoped he was actually okay.

Half of schools in federal survey open for full-time learning,"Meckler, Laura",Washington Post,2021-03-24,"White students far more likely to be getting in-person instruction
The first federal data on education during the pandemic finds nearly half of public schools were open for full-time, face-to-face classes, with White children far more likely than Black, Hispanic or Asian American students to be attending in person. 
The data suggests the nation is both close to a goal set by President Biden for a return to school and a considerable distance to a full return to normalcy.
The survey also raised questions about the quality of education being delivered to those learning from home. About one-third of schools offer two hours or less of live instruction per day for those learning either full or part time at home. Some offer none. 
The survey results include a representative sample of schools serving fourth- and eighth-grade students, the first attempt by the federal government to assess the state of education since schools closed en masse a year ago. The report also offers the first demographic and regional breakdown of in-person learning.
Biden has made reopening schools a key goal for his early presidency and says he wants a majority of K-8 schools open for full-time, in-person classes by his 100th day in office, at the end of April. The survey, which covered January and, in some cases, February, suggests he's likely to hit that target. It found 47 percent of schools serving fourth-graders and 46 percent serving eighth-graders were open for full in-person instruction.
But the survey also found millions of students still don't have full-time school available while others opted for remote education. 
Overall, 60 percent of fourth-graders and 68 percent of eighth-graders were at home at least part of the school week, either fully remote or in hybrid programs that combine time in the classroom - often just a day or two each week - with distance learning. 
""We're a long way from normal,"" said Dennis Roche of Burbio, a data firm that has been tracking school reopenings through its own survey. ""Offering in-person education is not the only step. It's a major step, but it's not the end. You've got to get students in the classroom taking advantage of it.""
Educators, parents and policymakers all fear the prolonged period of remote schooling is taking a significant toll on students' academic and emotional well-being. Some school districts have been open since last August, but others have struggled for months to craft plans that teachers and parents will accept as safe. 
Most striking is a wide racial gap. About half of all White students were attending school in person full-time in January, the survey found. But that was true for just 28 percent of Black students and 33 percent of Hispanic students. 
Rates were lowest among Asian American students, at just 15 percent. 
The gap reflects differences in what is offered by schools serving students of different races as well as decisions by families. 
Big-city districts, which serve more students of color, have been slower to reopen and in many cases do not offer a full-time face-to-face option. Officials said they had not yet analyzed how much offerings vs. family preferences influenced the results.
Asian American families have said they worry about elderly parents in cramped, multigenerational households, distrust promises of safety measures and fear their children will face racist harassment at school. Some are pleased with the online learning. And many live on the coasts, where their districts are less likely to offer full-time options.
Black and Hispanic families, who have seen their communities ravaged by the pandemic, also have been more likely to choose remote instruction. 
""The world told Black and Brown people they were three times more likely to die from coronavirus ... (that) Black and Brown people needed to be more afraid of coronavirus than other people,"" said Krystal Barnett, executive director of Bridge 2 Hope in St. Louis, a parent advocacy group. She said many parents heard these statistics and concluded: ""Of course I'm not bringing my child back, because in my mind, they're still three times more likely to die than their counterparts.""
Rates of in-person enrollment also vary dramatically by school location.
More than half of fourth-graders living in rural areas or towns were enrolled in full-time, in-person programs. In suburbs, it was 36 percent, and in cities, just 25 percent.
It also found students in the South and the Midwest were more likely to be attending full-time in-person school than those in the Northeast or the West.
About one in four districts offered no in-person classes at all. On the flip side, about 1 in 5 districts offered no remote education at all. In these districts, all students were attending in person all the time. The report did not break down where these districts were located.
The new data come as administration officials convene on Wednesday for a virtual summit promoting the reopening of schools. The summit is to include remarks from first lady Jill Biden and Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, as well as conversations intended to showcase best practices by districts that are operating in person. 
Also appearing will be Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which last week cleared the way for more in-person school by saying three feet of space between students, down from six, was sufficient to prevent spread of the virus. One panel will cover technical assistance and seek to clarify federal guidance on reopening. 
Biden and Vice President Harris will also deliver pretaped remarks. 
The survey also offered a first national look at how much live instruction students are getting, an important metric given the large number of students still learning from home. About a third received more than five hours a day, about a third were offered three to four hours per day, and about a third got two hours or less.
Those figures surprised Peggy Carr, associate commissioner at the National Center for Education Statistics. 
""I knew it was going to be low but not quite that low,"" she said.
Scant live instruction was most common in the Midwest and in towns, and less common in the Northeast and in cities.
But Carr said she was encouraged by the number of schools that were open for at least some in-person learning in January. A number of districts have reopened since then, so the current total is likely to be higher. The Education Department plans to report results from the same set of schools once a month. 
Throughout the pandemic, educators have talked about a need to prioritize certain students for in-person instruction. The survey found for fourth grade, 44 percent of schools prioritized students with disabilities, with about 1 in 4 prioritizing English language learners, students with lower grades, students without Internet access at home and students experiencing homelessness. Those percentages were higher across the board for eighth grade.
Nonetheless, the survey found that children with disabilities and those learning English attended in-person school at similar rates to other students.
The survey was conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the federal Institute for Education Sciences. It included 3,500 schools serving fourth-graders and 3,500 schools serving eighth-graders.

"For Asian Americans, shootings are culmination of year of racism","FosterFrau, Silvia; Liu, Marian; Knowles, Hannah; Kornfield, Meryl",Washington Post,2021-03-18,"As Helen Kim Ho learned that a White man with a self- described sex addiction was charged with killing eight people - including six Asian women - at spas in the Atlanta area on Tuesday, she imagined the stereotypes of Asian women that must have run through his head. 
""We're not really Americans, we're perpetually foreigners, and that idea plays out with women as being oversexualized,"" said Ho, a Korean American and a founder of the advocacy group Asian Americans Advancing Justice in Atlanta. ""All of that had to have played out in this man's own mind. In addition to the unspoken notion that Asian people are easy targets.""
Atlanta police said the suspect told them that his actions were not racially motivated - even though the shooter targeted businesses known for employing Asians, and six victims were Asian women. The suspect said he had a ""sex addiction,"" according to police, and wanted to eliminate temptation, which sounded to many women as if their sexuality was somehow to blame.
The gunman's intent seemed crystal clear to Asians living in Atlanta and across the nation who have long had to confront stereotyping, hateful harassment and even violence - and who say things have gotten even worse amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
For Asian women, the moment felt particularly threatening. 
As soon as Crystal Jin Kim heard about the shooting, she reached out to her mother and father, who immigrated to the United States from Korea. In a text, she urged them ""to be safe, to be careful, and to pray.""
She thought about rescheduling one of their upcoming doctor appointments, and she worried about her mother going to work at a small business in the Atlanta area - she asked that the type of business not be named for fear of her mother being targeted. 
""Since I was a kid I've heard racial slurs yelled at me or my parents, or witnessed my parents being treated as if they were stupid because their English isn't perfect, even though my mom's English is really good,"" said Kim, a second-generation Korean American. ""Those small moments really add up. I don't think we've ever spoken up against those small moments. . . . It's easier to try not to think about it, or to try to let it go. To try to bury the hurt.""
People have leaned out of cars to scream ""Asian!"" at her, she said, and she has gotten comments about how she must like Jackie Chan, the Hong Kong martial artist and actor. As an Asian woman, she said men often ascribe characteristics to her that don't reflect her personality - that's she's a pushover, or soft-spoken.
""Really, I'm not - I'm very talkative and extroverted,"" Kim said. ""It's just people having these assumptions and treating me like a perfect Asian girl. Not even a woman, but a girl.""
David Palumbo-Liu, a Stanford professor and author of ""Asian/American: Historical Crossings of a Racial Frontier,"" said there is a long history, extending well before the Vietnam War, of the fetishization of and murderous intent toward Asian women. He cited the Broadway musical ""Miss Saigon,"" which critics have said romanticizes an imperialistic relationship and portrays Asian women as acquiescent and self-sacrificing.
The suspect ""said it wasn't racially motivated, but on the other hand, he's going specifically to these spas where Asian women work precisely to serve the sexual fantasies of White males,"" Palumbo-Liu said in an interview, ""so to disentangle them is really to do a disservice to the fact that these things are so linked together.""
The shooting made visible the worst-case scenarios many Asians living in the United States had feared. Many sadly expressed a similar sentiment: We knew this was coming.
The coalition Stop AAPI Hate has been documenting anti-Asian attacks since the pandemic started last March and says there have been nearly 3,800 hate-fueled incidents against the Asian American and Pacific Islander community in the U.S. - a number the group says is probably a fraction of the true number. About 3 in 10 Asian adults said they've experienced jokes or slurs about their race or ethnicity during the pandemic, according to Pew Research - the highest percent among all races.
More than 68 percent of documented reports of anti-Asian harassment and violence since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic have been from women.
""I've never been this afraid to be Asian in America,"" said Dorothy Kuo, 38, who attempted to explain to her 6-year-old daughter what had happened in their community. 
""I told her 'Mommy is having a hard time focusing today because last night there were eight people killed.' I just told her, honestly, what happened,"" said Kuo, who is Korean American, like several of the victims. 
Kuo said she felt it was important to tell her daughter so she understands the world she's stepping into, one in which she might have to be more careful as an Asian woman.
""I've been refused seating at a restaurant,"" Kuo said, ""and even then I've never felt what I feel now.""
Jane Kim Coloseus, 32, grew angry Wednesday when Atlanta police declared it was too soon to say whether the slayings were racially motivated.
""As an Asian woman, it brings out a lot of the experiences or harassment we have received throughout our lives in general, and just have that completely invalidated because of what the suspect is saying,"" said Coloseus, a Korean American who is executive director of the nonprofit Her Term, which recruits women to run for office in Georgia.
She has long felt like she had to be more guarded - whether it's in the workplace or walking down the street - because of anti-Asian sentiments and the sexualization of Asian women's bodies. Asians have long been part of the fabric of the United States, she said, yet have ""been kept on the sidelines as the model minority,"" their voices ignored or muted. 
""To me the equation is pretty straightforward,"" she said of the shooter's intent. ""It is racially motivated.""

Anti-Asian attacks must no longer be minimized,"Dvorak, Petula",Washington Post,2021-03-19,"After Dylan Adler was screamed at, chased and sucker-punched by a stranger on a New York street last year, he had almost convinced himself it was just bad luck. Nothing to do with the color of his skin.
""But I talked with other friends,"" said Adler, 24, who checked in with his fellow Asian Americans about the attack, which happened at the very start of the global pandemic. ""They had other incidents, too.""
That was also the start of an alarming increase in hate attacks against Asian Americans. There were about 3,800 recorded over the past year, from slurs on the street and stabbings to vandalism at Asian American-owned businesses. It went up 150 percent in 2020, according to research by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University at San Bernardino.
In Columbia, Md., last month, three businesses were vandalized and ransacked on Lunar New Year, the most important holiday in Chinese culture. The criminals ignored the Cheesecake Factory and Chipotle nearby but hit Urban Hot Pot, Kung Fu Tea and Bonchon. Police said they were investigating them as commercial burglaries, not hate crimes. The community felt differently.
""We are deeply saddened that during these difficult times our community is filled with such hatred and division,"" wrote Alexis Chen, a family member of some of the store owners, on a GoFundMe to raise money for a group working to stop hate crimes. ""As an Asian American establishment, the fact that these attacks came on Lunar New Year, such a celebrated time of year for us, is heartbreaking.""
The attacks have been escalating all year, as arguments over the pandemic were twisted into anti-Asian hatred, led by the chief flamethrower, former president Donald Trump, who joked, even as thousands were dying from the virus, that it was the ""kung flu.""
Adler, who is an actor, comedian and musician, said part of why he didn't at first register that the attack against him ""was a hate crime"" was because of how little he's read about crimes against Asians.
It is an invisible hatred, largely ignored.
""It's very hard, culturally, for many Asian Americans to self-advocate,"" said Rumi Matsuyama, a hockey mom I know from my son's team who lives in Hyattsville, Md. 
Matsuyama was one of the parents who tirelessly advocated against hatred in the largely White hockey community after an incident involving a Black player. And I wrote about it, interviewing the Black players who had been taunted, howled at and called the n-word on the ice.
Another Asian American mom quietly thanked me for shining a light on any kind of hatred, one that her son consistently faced in years of playing but never reported.
But none of us parents dwelled on the hatred that Asian American players faced. 
At a game two years ago, I remember an all-White team on Maryland's Eastern Shore told one of the Asian American players on my son's team to ""Go back to China."" 
The boy didn't tell his mom about it until days later, and the other kids, including my own, didn't report this to the grown-ups at the game.
There were similar incidents at other rinks, with other teams. And they rarely garnered sanctions or outrage.
Adler said he was told at a young age that these types of insults weren't about hatred.
""I almost gaslit myself into thinking it wasn't racist,"" he said. ""White people have directly told me that racism against Asians doesn't exist. I didn't even register things that were racist as racism.""
He grew up in California yet never heard in school about the nation's shameful past when it came to Asian Americans.
""I learned about Japanese internment from my Japanese family members who were interned during World War II, not from my history teachers,"" he said. ""If that's not white supremacy, I don't know what is.""
Matsuyama said that she and some of her fellow Asian Americans aren't vocal when it comes to themselves.
""It feels selfish,"" she said, when there are more dire attacks against other groups.
But this week, six Asian women at Asian spas were slaughtered in Georgia by a shooter who saw the places as a ""temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate,"" according to authorities. 
He didn't go to the Pink Pony, the Blue Flame Club or the Stroker's Lounge in Atlanta, strip joints that aren't primarily Asian. He went to the places where he could gun down middle-aged Asian women.
It may have been about sex or sexism, too. But the shooter made a very intentional decision about where his bull's eye was going to be.
""While the details of the shootings are still emerging, the broader context cannot be ignored,"" Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta said in a statement. ""The shootings happened under the trauma of increasing violence against Asian Americans nationwide, fueled by white supremacy and systemic racism.""
On Thursday, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing to address the rise of hate crimes against Asian Americans. Lawmakers asked their colleagues to tone down the rhetoric that can fuel attacks.
The fixation on China, the punchlines about the ""Wuhan virus"" or ""kung flu,"" are emboldening bigots, they said.
""Your president and your party and your colleagues can talk about issues with any other country that you want, but you don't have to do it by putting a bull's eye on the back of Asian Americans across this country, on our grandparents, on our kids,"" Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) said. 
""Our community is bleeding,"" Meng said. ""We've been in pain and we've been screaming out for help.""
And the rest of America can no longer say we don't hear them.

Asian American businesses bear costs of hate,"Jan, Tracy",Washington Post,2021-03-26,"To San Antonio restaurateur Mike Nguyen, the threat was clear. Alongside the racist graffiti covering the windows of his ramen shop - ""Kung flu,"" ""Commie,"" ""Ramen noodle flu"" - were these words, spray-painted in red: ""Hope u die.""
Shock and hurt turned to rage, then fear. After Nguyen reported the vandalism to local law enforcement and the FBI, police agreed to step up drive-by patrols. But he and his employees would be left largely on their own.
Since the March 14 incident, the threats to Nguyen's life and business have escalated. Last week, someone wrote ""hope it burns down"" on the Instagram account for his restaurant, Noodle Tree. An anonymous man phoned the restaurant, reciting Nguyen's home address with a warning: ""We're coming for you.""
""The threats are getting more violent, more extreme,"" said Nguyen, 33.
Asian American entrepreneurs across the country are combating a sharp rise in racist threats and attacks on their businesses that many feel authorities are not taking seriously, even after last week's shooting rampage targeting three Asian spas in Atlanta left eight people dead.
Amid heightened fears, business owners have begun hiring their own security, buying guns and cutting their hours of operation as well as advertising, among other costly safety measures that limit their profits - and profile - at a time when businesses are already struggling, according to Asian American chambers of commerce and other business organizations.
Asian-owned restaurants, salons and shops rapidly lost business at the start of the pandemic because of racial stigma, fueled by President Donald Trump's repeated references to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" and ""Kung flu."" Now, community leaders warn that the racism targeting these businesses could hamper the country's economic recovery from the coronavirus-induced recession.
""What happened in Atlanta is a very extreme example of the threat to human life, and folks have got to understand that as we try to emerge from covid-19 and try to conduct business, there are other threats to contend with,"" said Lamar Heystek, president of the San Francisco-based ASIAN Inc., a nonprofit that works with the U.S. Department of Commerce to develop economic opportunity for Asian Americans and other minorities. ""It doesn't take an economist to see how that could really dampen business activity and an economic recovery in which Asian American Pacific Islander-owned businesses take part.""
Asian Americans owned more than 10 percent of all U.S. businesses in 2018. These firms earned $863 billion in receipts and employed 5.1 million people, Census Bureau data shows.
""How is that contribution muted by hate, discrimination and violence?"" Heystek said. ""We need to appreciate the systemic effect of these incidents that range from graffiti all the way up to death.""
It's not only businesses in urban centers like Chinatowns in San Francisco and New York that have become targets of racial harassment. So have Asian-owned businesses in suburban strip malls and rural America, Heystek said.
Businesses have been vandalized, robbed, attacked online in racist Yelp reviews. Employees, regardless of their ethnicity, have been blamed for the spread of the coronavirus.
At Nguyen's two-year-old ramen restaurant, graffiti scrawled on a patio table admonished him to ""Go back 2 China."" He is of Vietnamese and French descent.
The racist abuse began after he criticized the decision by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in early March to rescind a statewide mask mandate that was in place to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
With the perpetrators still at large, Nguyen, who is undergoing cancer treatment, said he has never feared more for his life. The threats come daily now, making him so ""paranoid"" that he does not allow people to get within 10 feet.
He had delayed fully reopening indoor dining because of the lack of police presence - and now must budget $5,700 a month on private security for the four days a week his restaurant is open. He temporarily left town. And he reluctantly bought a gun.
""I am personally against guns, but we had to get one just to protect ourselves now,"" Nguyen said. ""I can understand why a lot of Asian Americans don't want to report these things because of retaliation and lack of protection. Will it take for me to get seriously hurt or die for someone to take these threats seriously?""
The San Antonio Police Department issued a written statement saying ""officers continue to provide drive-bys to the business. We have additionally contacted others in the area to report any suspicious activity and we will respond accordingly. This case remains actively under investigation and anyone with information is urged to contact police.""
Among the most vulnerable are retail businesses, restaurants and salons whose storefronts open to public sidewalks. Many store owners have kept their doors wide-open to improve ventilation during the pandemic. Not only have they recently begun shutting their doors, they're locking them and removing cultural signage and decor that could make them easy targets for people looking to terrorize Asian businesses, according to business owners and community leaders.
""Right now, the key word is alert,"" said Kevin Chan, 51, owner of Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory in San Francisco's Chinatown, who said he has received threatening phone calls after he intervened when a customer was attacked in front of his store. He now locks the gate to his shop at 5 p.m., even though the store is open until 9.
""To me, we don't have much freedom at all,"" Chan said. ""We have to watch our backs. That's how I feel right now as an old immigrant, as an American.""
Employees newly wary of taking public transportation to work are shifting their hours, asking not to come in early or work late - fearful of what they may encounter along their commute in light of viral videos of Asian pedestrians being violently assaulted.
""We have to start quantifying the economic effect of hate,"" Heystek said. ""We cannot ignore this grave threat to our economy.""
Resentment against Asian Americans has long existed in this country. They've been a frequent scapegoat during economic woes and disease outbreaks, and in wartime propaganda. Racist incidents today are more easily recorded on smartphones and shared over social media, contributing to increased fear.
There is no comprehensive data measuring anti-Asian hate crimes during the coronavirus pandemic. One in 3 female Asian American business owners reported experiencing anti-Asian sentiment, according to a 2020 survey by minority business organizations.
A recent analysis of self-reported incidents by Russell Jeung, chairman of the Asian American studies department at San Francisco State University, who is studying racism and xenophobia during the pandemic, shows at least 3,800 cases of harassment and assault against Asians since March 2020, with more than twice as many women as men saying they have been mistreated. Most incidents, experts say, are never reported to law enforcement.
Immigrant business owners whose instinct is not to report racial harassment to police are instead seeking help from culturally aligned organizations like ASIAN Inc.
""What they are saying is, 'I'm fearful of opening my doors to the public. I don't want to put my workers in harm's way. If they can hurt a shop in Atlanta, what prevents them from hurting a shop in San Francisco?'"" Heystek said. ""Folks have got to feel empowered to do business in this climate.""
In response, Asian American organizations are helping small-business owners secure funding to install security cameras that record video and audio, distribute personal security alarms to employees that can be programmed to call 911, and connect them with self-defense training.
The National Asian/Pacific Islander American Chamber of Commerce and Entrepreneurship held an emergency Zoom meeting last week to discuss anti-Asian hate and the Atlanta shootings that drew more than four dozen business leaders.
""There are two illnesses attacking AAPI small businesses: One is covid. The other is hate,"" said Chiling Tong, president and chief executive of the national chamber, who has been fielding calls and emails from around the country from businesses seeking guidance. ""They are just very scared to operate, especially after the attacks in Atlanta.""
Geri Guidote Hernandez, the Filipina American owner of Savory Crust, an empanada carryout in a Chicago-area ethnic strip mall, said the attacks compelled her this week to draw up an emergency active-shooter plan for her employees, who include her two daughters.
""Growing up, anytime we felt racism, what do our parents say? 'Just ignore that.' So we do it over our whole lifetime,"" she said. ""It's a different environment now.""
In Southern California, the Orange County Human Relations Commission, which has tracked hate incidents since 1995, recorded a tenfold increase of incidents targeting Asian Americans in 2020 from prior years.
On Tuesday, a Vietnamese American-owned beauty school in Orange County, where a fifth of the population is Asian, hosted a self-defense workshop for salon and spa workers. Tam Nguyen, president of Advance Beauty College, started 34 years ago by his parents, said he plans to also offer workshops on de-escalation, safe confrontation and the use of Mace. He and other nail-care industry leaders are distributing cards and fliers listing newly created police hotlines for reporting hate crimes in Vietnamese and Korean. And businesses are chipping in for private security guards to patrol Asian shopping plazas.
In Sacramento, Kelly Shum, owner of Mad Butcher Meat Co., said she started spending $5,000 a month for a security guard after a customer last spring tried to attack her younger sister, who was enforcing the mask policy at the door. Shum said she had called police but that they never responded. So she stepped in with a baseball bat to get the man to leave.
The Sacramento Police Department said it has no record of a call from Shum's business at the time of the incident.
The 28-year-old entrepreneur said she felt she had little choice but to incur the extra expense to protect her employees, nearly all of whom are Chinese and Vietnamese immigrant women. Three of them have quit out of fear.
""Having a security guard is extreme just to fight off racists,"" Shum said. But ""so many customers are calling us 'coronavirus,' 'China virus' and saying, 'Why should I be wearing a mask if you people are the dirty ones?'
""No one feels safe. No one wants to come to work,"" she said. The security guard ""is literally only here so we can do our job.""
But that did not stop a car from waiting in the parking lot for her father to leave the shop and tailing him, according to footage from a security camera. Her sister, who was also driving home in a separate car, told Shum that the car tried to run their father off the road.
In February, a customer left a mutilated cat in their parking lot, invoking a racist stereotype of Asians. Shum said her lone White employee volunteered to dispose of the carcass, aware of the implications of an Asian American being seen discarding the animal.
""All of us knew what it meant and understood the gravity of the situation. This was a very obvious hate crime,"" Shum said.
When she posted about the incident on social media, Shum was aghast that some users defended the man who left the cat. ""People were like, 'Don't you guys do that? Don't you guys butcher up cats and dogs? Maybe he was on to something?' "" she said.
Shum said that even when police arrived to take a report of the incident, one officer questioned why she considered it a hate crime. The perpetrator was not arrested, but Shum said he called the shop to apologize after seeing surveillance video of himself on the news and said he was ""having a bad day.""
""It's domestic terrorism,"" she said.
Karl Chan, a Sacramento police spokesman, said the case remains open and detectives are investigating it as a hate crime.
""In order for a crime to fall under the definition of a bias or hate related incident a distinction must be made that the crime/incident was motivated by bias,"" Chan said in a written statement. ""One of the ways that officers can make this distinction during the preliminary investigation is by asking questions that would identify how the victim perceived the crime or incident.""
Shum, a former Los Angeles television producer and marketing manager, had returned to Sacramento in late 2019 to take over the butcher shop from her parents, immigrants who came from China in the 1980s. She had grand promotion plans for the store, which serves a predominantly low-income community. She built a website and started online orders and deliveries, to make the shop more accessible.
""We're now hiding and not promoting in a way that we want to or used to,"" Shum said. ""That is so detrimental to us, but we're scared of people finding out who we are.""
Shum has removed most of her mother's Chinese brush paintings and other cultural decor to make the business appear ""less Asian."" She stopped marketing the business on social media with photos of a cat figurine waving one paw, a common symbol that Asian-owned businesses display to bring good luck.
""You have to minimize yourself in hopes that nobody notices you and attacks you,"" she said. ""It's such a miserable half-existence.""
Last weekend, in the wake of the Atlanta attacks, Shum thought about hiring extra security to check for weapons at the door. But she could not afford it.

'This could have been me' ,Michelle Ye Hee Lee ,Washington Post,2021-05-30,"When Kym Lee read about the victims, and the long hours they worked to support their families, she thought about her own mom. 
Lee's family emigrated to Duluth, Ga., when she was 4 years old and opened a silk flower store at a sprawling flea market. Throughout her childhood, she and her siblings worked weekends at their parents' business, which grew from one booth to two, then three and eventually, a stand-alone store. 
Nearly three decades later, Lee's mom still works 10 to 14 hours a day, every day, she said. 
""What I appreciate about that is the hard work ethic that my parents instilled in me - to get our homework and everything done, so we can work on the weekends so we're selling things and studying and doing the best that we can,"" she said. 
Lee read that the daughter of one of the slain women said her mom worked 12 hours every day. Lee thought: ""That's my mom. That's 100 percent my mom."" 
""That's what a lot of immigrants do: You come here to just build a better life and give a better life for your family. You'll do whatever it takes."" 
After the shootings, Lee received a text relaying a warning about an active shooter targeting Asian businesses: Tell your Asian friends with businesses to shut down, and don't come out tonight. 
""That was Tuesday night, and all of the stories we were hearing, when I was trying to pull up news reports, it was just so confusing. Then the next day the narrative had completely changed,"" she said, when the suspect told police that the shooting was not racially motivated. 
""There's so many levels of injustice and racism in this, because we took the word of the shooter that it wasn't racism, but we didn't give that same benefit of the doubt to the women, who now have no voices to speak."" 
Days after the shooting, Lee wrote a public post on her Facebook page addressed to the news media. She was upset and struggling to process the shootings, and frustrated with the lack of details about the women and the speculations about whether they had been involved in sex work. She wrote: 
""These women deserved so much more. To be remembered with respect and dignity. I grieve them and how they were so unjustly portrayed. 
This could have been my grandma. 
This could have been my mom. 
This could have been me. 
Media, do better. Recognize your racial biases, and don't let this happen again.

- Signed, An Asian-American woman"" 
The weekend after the shooting, Lee marched with her children and her Korean American husband at a protest denouncing racism and violence toward Asians. They held signs carrying the names and ages of the shooting victims. She explained to her children that Asians were being discriminated against - which turned out to be an easier conversation than she had anticipated, because she had taken them to Black Lives Matter protests. 
""I just can't believe in 2021 we need Black Lives Matter signs and now we're fighting against anti-Asian hate."" 
""I took my daughter to one of the rallies ... and was thinking, 'We have got to do better. For her.' The shooting sprees were about Asian women - grandmas, moms and me but it's really about her."" 
- 
When Shyu found out about the shootings through her friends, she heard the gunman was targeting Asian-owned businesses. She immediately thought of her mother, who operates a hair salon on Atlanta's Buford Highway, catering to a mostly Asian clientele. The salon is located in a strip mall about eight miles from two of the three spas the shooter targeted. 
""It made me really nervous when I found out the information because that just hits so close to home,"" she said. ""She works in a plaza called Pinetree Plaza. They're all Asian-owned. He could've gone door to door. Real quick. It would've been super easy for him. It was really upsetting."" 
Shyu already worried about her mother working during the pandemic. Now she worries about her even more. 
""Day in and day out, they have to use their bodies to make an income and have their livelihoods be okay. And to have that threatened ... that just seems so harsh to me."" 
Shyu, whose parents are immigrants from Taiwan, was born in the United States and was raised in a tightknit Taiwanese American community in Atlanta. She works as an associate director at a media agency in San Francisco. 
After the shooting, she purchased pepper spray for her mom. 
""I asked her, 'Don't you feel anxious or scared?' And she said, 'Julia, what am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to be scared all the time? What's the point?' It made clear to me - I underestimate the fragility of it all.' 
You feel protective of your parents as children, Shyu said. But then she remembers the strength and resolve of first-generation immigrants like her parents, who left their home countries to start new lives in America. 
""There are a lot of things that come easy to us but not easy to them. Then I have to remind myself that actually, they made a life here on their own, so they're much more resilient,"" she said. ""My parents are much more strong than I give them credit for."" 
Whenever Thao Lee hears about a mass shooting, she worries for her three children, who are spread out across the country from Alaska to D.C. Nowadays, with a pandemic and reports that Asians across the country are being harassed, she worries even more. 
Lee is a refugee from Laos, who settled in Spokane, Wash., in 1985 at 16 years old. She and her husband gave their children both Hmong names and American names, and they have a close, huge family. Word spreads fast, especially through Lee's mother, an avid listener of Hmong radio who calls her grandchildren individually whenever she hears of a crisis. 
The day of the shooting, the multiple family text and Facebook messaging chains went into overdrive as relatives checked in on one another, sharing tips on how to stay safe and urging vigilance. 
Lee's daughter, who goes by Monica, said it felt like the shooting validated a growing fear among her family and Asian American friends. 
""Leading up to the shooting, all of these anti-Asian hate incidents were happening to our elders, right. And so I think just when the shooting happened in Atlanta, it just compounded all the feelings that I think we were sort of suppressing at that time or didn't really know how to process yet,"" Monica said. 
For Thao, the shooting reinforced her feeling of vulnerability during the pandemic. The shooting could have happened anywhere, she said. 
""It could be me, it could be any of my children or anybody who is Asian now that because of all this going on. Even when I go to the store, I have to watch my back all the time. If I have to sneeze or cough, I really have to look around to see who is around me, what are they going to act or how are they going to look at me,"" Thao said. 
The Asian diaspora in America is diverse, including when it comes to socioeconomics. Hmong Americans tend to experience more poverty than many other Asian American 
groups. 
""We all know of women who work in these sort of working jobs,"" Monica said. ""Being Hmong American also means that oftentimes we come from low-income working- class backgrounds."" 
That includes her mother and her aunts, who took cleaning jobs at office buildings on the weekends to earn extra income for their families. 
""I mean, that's exactly what our parents do, right? Especially immigrant Asian parents who will work double time, or work two or three jobs no matter how hard it is,"" Monica said, ""just to make sure that their kids have better comfortable lives than they did."" 
Monica said the shooting made her wonder about the support and connections society provides to those who are often overlooked, especially people who work in lower- wage jobs and have limited language capabilities. 
""I always think about that like, you know, I love how these GoFundMe's came to be. But on the flip side, it just it sucks that, like, why couldn't we have helped these people beforehand?"" Monica said. ""Why were they subjected to these positions, and I guess their position in society, before the shooting happened?"" 
Kim moved to America from South Korea in 1999 as an eighth-grader, eventually settling in with a host family in Anchorage. After attending college in Montana, she moved back to Anchorage to start working. But after her work permit fell through, she was no longer eligible to stay in the United States. 
She was in her early 20s at the time and didn't have enough money to buy a ticket back home to Korea, she said. So she overstayed her visa. 
She worked several jobs, including waitressing, and earned so little she could barely afford housing. Then she found out she was pregnant. 
""When I was pregnant, I almost became homeless because I didn't have any money and it was hard. I thought about going to homeless women's shelter and things like that, but I didn't want to risk myself,"" she said. 
Instead, she applied for protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which grants legal status to some people who entered the country as children and are unlawfully present. Even going to the hospital during her pregnancy made her fear deportation. 
But she was approved and has been renewing with the program every two years since. She now works for a government agency and raises her 5-year-old son as a single mother. 
""I've come from basically zero to here. I am very thankful,"" she said. 
Kim constantly fears losing all that she worked for, including her ability to take care of her son. 
""In a sense I felt like, 'What if I was in a supermarket, or I was in the spa, and someone came in with a gun? Am I able to take care of my child if I were that person? What is going to happen to my child?' I [read about] this one lady who had two boys. The two boys said how great of a mom she was, how she was trying really, really hard. My heart ached."" 
When she saw that another victim was a Korean mother of mixed-race children, she saw in them herself and her own mixed-race son. 
""I felt really bad for her sons, because my son is also half Korean, half White. And I know that her sons, both of her sons were mixed race, and I just somehow put myself into her position. What if I were her? What if my son was the one who was interviewed this interview?"" 
Ming was born in Indiana to parents who emigrated from China and were the only ones in their families to live in the United States. 
Her mother was in graduate school when she was born, so Ming was sent to live with her grandparents in China until her mother obtained her degree. Then, when Ming was 4, her father died of cancer. 
""Reading a lot about the women reminded me a lot about my mom and also my grandmother, who's still in China, but she is very much working class and has suffered through a lot just to make sure her kids were able to have a better life. And I think my mom was the same way."" 
Ming was ""thinking about her struggles in this country and trying to not just make enough money to support me but also dealing with so much racism and sexism along the way. I really thought of my parents in these women.""

Ming, a campaign manager for gender and worker justice at the advocacy organization Citizen Action of New York, said her first reaction to the shootings was: ""Of course this happened. It was the inevitable end point."" 
For months, many Asian Americans across the country had witnessed attacks and harassment spurred by the pandemic and had become increasingly anxious. Yet she still felt there wasn't enough awareness of the xenophobia tied to the pandemic. 
""I'm seeing a lot of Asian people, that this was the final wake-up call for them rather than all the hate that has gone on during the pandemic and all the racism that had gone on beforehand, [and it] finally took a shooting to get them to pay attention."" 
Among the things that too many people seemed to newly learn about Asian Americans in the wake of the shooting: that there is a growing contingent of them in the South. Ming grew up in Texas and North Carolina, two states where the Asian American population has increased.

""People always forget that there are Asians in the South. There's a level of invisibility, when in actually, there are so many Asians in places like Georgia and Texas."" 
""I definitely feel like I'm still processing,"" Ming said in an interview late April, more than a month and a half after the shootings. She is constantly reminded of the shootings and other violent attacks in her work, which is focused on social justice and advocacy. As the only person of Asian descent in her organization, it can feel isolating to process it alone. 
""Having that constant stream of images and video of violence has made it very hard to process and hard to grieve,"" Ming said. ""I think it's going to be an ongoing grieving process."" 
They represented a diverse community: A single mother of two sons in their early 20s. Two emigrated from South Korea in the 1980s. A grandmother of six in a multiracial family with relatives in Japan. A Chinese American mother who owned two spa businesses. One had no family in the United States. 
Six of the eight people who died in the Atlanta-area spa shootings in March were women of Asian descent. They represented a diaspora that includes some 50 ethnicities, even more languages and dialects, and countless experiences. 
Yet despite the diversity of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) experience, the women's deaths resonated throughout the community in a distinctly familiar 
way. 
And they particularly hit home for many Asian American women: That could have been my mother, my grandmother. It could have been me. 
So different, yet somehow so similar: That has long been a characteristic of the Asian diaspora in America, said Eileen Cheng-yin Chow, a professor of Asian American and diaspora studies at Duke University: The ""idea of 'people like you' as Asian Americans has been strangely specific yet diffuse."" 
""My immigrant experience is not the same as these women, but I felt it in my bones. Because to be here is to be the same,"" Chow said. 
We spoke with 10 Asian American women across the country about the connection they feel to the six slain women, despite living drastically different lives. They shared stories about the sacrifices of their immigrant parents and grandparents, and the resilience required to assimilate in a country where Asians face ongoing harassment and xenophobia. 
In 2008, Hatta was one of about 10 people working at the Arkansas Democratic Party headquarters when a gunman opened fire and killed Bill Gwatney, the state party chairman. 
Hatta, a public affairs consultant and artist, has worked on several political campaigns, including Bill Clinton's campaigns in 1992 and 1996. She settled down in Arkansas in 2005 after working there on a presidential campaign. 
Hatta frequently gets calls from people checking in on her whenever a mass shooting occurs. That's how she found out about the Atlanta shooting. 
""People reach out to me when these things happen. Sometimes it's worse than others. Sometimes it's unfortunately just another shooting,"" she said. ""But this one is different in that workplace ones always kind of hit a little close to home. And being primarily women and then Asian women, it was just a little harder, because obviously I identify as both."" 
Hatta grew up in a small town of 10,000 people in a northeastern Ohio. Her mother is White. Her father, who is Japanese, came to the United States in 1961 for college, where he met his wife. 
She spent gap year in Tokyo, where her father is from, in the 1980s. People would ask her: ""Isn't America so dangerous? Don't people pull out guns all the time?"" 
Decades later, there have been so many mass shootings and so many people whose lives have been permanently altered by gun violence. But for Hatta, the Atlanta shooting impacted her on multiple levels. 
There was a familiar banality of the circumstances: The victims were simply people who showed up for work that day, like herself in 2008. They were immigrants, like Hatta's father - who came to America for new opportunities. 
When Hatta found out six of the victims were of Asian descent, she thought about the fact that the thousands of verbal, physical and online attacks reported to the Stop AAPI Hate hotline since the outbreak of the pandemic have been disproportionately reported by women. 
""You add a gun to the situation and Asian women are even more vulnerable.... Knowing people who chose to come here and made a life, and just to have something like this happen - I don't want to say it's worse than if it happened to someone else, but it adds so many layers as to why it hurts."" 
""You see people getting attacked for being Asian, and it's just kind of like: Where are we?"" 
Lee, a retired college dean, is a fourth-generation American who was born and raised in San Francisco. She remembers hearing about the experiences her older relatives had with discrimination and assimilation. For example, her uncles changed their last names from Leong to Way, which is not immediately recognizable as Chinese, so they could blend in professionally. They were strategic about it, she said: Don't make waves. Don't make trouble. 
Her dad ""had lots of stories to tell us about how they were discriminated against, and they learned strategies to protect themselves and to deal with the racism that they just came to accept, in terms of treatment."" 
""That generation [my parents and grandparents], really, the thinking was: Come here. Lay low. Get your education."" 
Lee and her husband, a Korean American, have built their family with an eye toward making progress over the isolation and discrimination that their elder generations faced. They adopted two children from Korea and tried to make sure they always felt they belonged and were fully integrated into a diverse their community. 
""As parents, we were very intentional about the decisions we made, in terms of where we were, where we lived, what schools, what friends we wanted them to grow up with,"" she said about her children, who are both adults now. 
But she and her husband had hoped to see more progress by now. 
""I still have an elderly aunt and uncle who live in the city. We go and have dinner with them every Sunday night and it doesn't feel safe in San Francisco, because of what's been happening across the country,"" she said. ""And I have not felt unsafe like this in my lifetime. I just haven't."" 
She said she believes former president Donald Trump and his attacks on China have played an outsize role in fomenting an environment of disdain toward Asian Americans. 
""I know that there's a lot of mental health problems that we will face as a society because of covid, and I think that's part of it [the attacks],"" she said. ""But I believe that Trump calling it 'China virus' or 'kung flu,' that that kind of mentality, that kind of hatred and ignorance and racism that comes from a person who's the president of this country, trickles down."" 
Lee's reaction to the shootings in Atlanta: Shock. Sadness. And somehow familiarity, like the stories she had heard about her parents and grandparents. 
""I think every immigrant's story is similar in some ways, where they just all want the same thing,"" she said. ""They want to be safe. They want to have food and housing. They want their children to have an education. They want to get a house at some point. It just seems like, why can't we make that possible?""

Undercounting of hate crimes draws criticism,"Nakamura, David",Washington Post,2021-02-23,"Recent attacks on Asian Americans renew worries over lack of data
A spate of high-profile assaults on Asian Americans has renewed long-standing criticism from Democrats and
civil rights groups that the U.S. government is vastly undercounting hate crimes, a problem that they say has
grown more acute amid rising white nationalism and deepening racial strife.
The attacks - including several in Northern California over the past month that attracted national attention -
followed months of warnings from advocates that anti-China rhetoric from former president Donald Trump over
the coronavirus pandemic was contributing to a surge in anti-Asian slurs and violence.
Although President Biden last month signed an executive action banning the federal government from employing
the sort of ""inflammatory and xenophobic"" language Trump used to describe the virus - such as ""China plague""
and ""kung flu"" - Asian American leaders said the recent attacks demonstrate a need for greater urgency in
dealing with such threats.
Among other incidents, Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old San Francisco resident who had emigrated from
Thailand, was killed in late January, in a brazen attack captured on a video that went viral on social media.
Antoine Watson, a 19-year-old African American man, was charged in connection with Ratanapakdee's death
and has pleaded not guilty.
Biden administration officials said they are working to address the problem, pointing to a section in the
executive memo that instructed the Justice Department to expand its reporting, tracking and prosecutions of
""hate incidents."" Officials said those efforts could go beyond hate crimes to include episodes of harassment and
discrimination.
During his Senate confirmation hearing Monday, Merrick Garland, Biden's nominee for attorney general, pledged
to support such efforts.
""Hate crimes tear at the fabric of our society. They make our citizens worried about walking the streets and
exercising even the most normal rights,"" Garland said. ""The role of the [Justice Department's] Civil Rights
Division is to prosecute those cases vigorously, and I can ensure you that it will if I am confirmed.""
A 1990 federal law mandates that the FBI collect data specifically on hate crimes each year, but the effort has
long been plagued by incomplete and inconsistent data provided by the nation's estimated 18,000 state,
municipal and tribal law enforcement agencies.
The administration is in the early stages of identifying strategies to compel broader participation. Among the
ideas advocates have pushed for is tying federal funding from the Justice Department's extensive grant
programs to increased training and reporting on hate crimes.
In 2019, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issued a report recommending Congress adopt legislation to
provide funding for incentives and calling on local police to establish dedicated hate-crime units. Catherine E.
Lhamon, who chaired that commission, now serves as deputy director for racial justice and equity on the White
House domestic policy council.
At a news conference last week, Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), chair of the Asian Pacific American Caucus, said she is
requesting a meeting with Justice Department leaders to discuss what she called a ""crisis point"" for the Asian
American community in dealing with ""an alarming surge of anti-Asian bigotry across the nation.""
Chu added that the 1990 law on reporting of hate crime data ""doesn't have any teeth"" because it does not
compel localities to comply or to do so in a consistent and thorough manner.
Last fall, the FBI reported 7,314 hate crimes nationwide in 2019, the most in a decade - but experts said the
statistics were woefully inadequate because too few local law enforcement agencies fully participate in federal
data collection efforts.
The FBI said that 15,588 law enforcement organizations participated in the 2019 hate crimes study, but just
2,172 agencies reported the total number of incidents contained in the report. Civil rights advocates called that
scenario implausible, pointing out that the entire state of Alabama reported no hate crimes to the FBI in both
2018 and 2019.
""The FBI reports help us identify trends, but their data is so woefully inadequate that it can't be relied on for
much,"" said civil rights lawyer Arjun Singh Sethi, author of ""American Hate: Survivors Speak Out.""
Some big-city law enforcement agencies have publicly reported an increase in bias attacks against Asian
Americans. For example, New York City's hate crimes task force investigated 27 incidents in 2020, including 24
tied to the coronavirus, a ninefold increase from the previous year.
But experts said local police agencies lack training and funding to properly investigate hate crimes, and many treat it as a low priority. Some conservative Republicans have opposed more stringent reporting requirements
to determine whether crimes are motivated by hate, arguing that such measures are redundant.
Yet advocates have pointed to a 2013 study from the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics that
found an average of 259,700 violent and property-related hate crimes from 2003 through 2011 after
assessing data from the annual National Crime Victimization Survey of American households.
In a statement, the FBI said participation in its data program is ""voluntary."" The agency added that it
anticipates the reporting methods would improve in the coming years as a greater percentage of local police
agencies transitions into the National Incident Based Reporting System, which requires more detailed and
consistent data.
In a bipartisan vote last year, the House approved the Jabara-Heyer No Hate Act, which aimed to bolster
federal aid to localities for hate-crime training and reporting. The GOP-controlled Senate refused to vote on it.
The legislation is named after Khalid Jabara, a man of Lebanese descent shot to death by a White neighbor in
Oklahoma in 2016, and Heather Heyer, a counterprotester killed at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville
in 2017. Neither of their killings was included in the FBI's hate crime reports.
With Democrats in control of both chambers, Chu said she hoped to revive the legislative effort. Rep. Ted Lieu
(D-Calif.) said he expects to gain bipartisan support for a letter to the Justice Department's new leadership
team similar to the one he sent last year with 150 co-signers from both parties asking then-Attorney General
William P. Barr to ""forcefully condemn anti-Asian bias."" Barr did not respond to that letter, Lieu's office said.
Advocacy groups have sought to fill the breach through websites and hotlines that allow Asian Americans to
self-report hate incidents, projects that share similarities to efforts from Muslim American groups to
document bias crimes after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.
Stop AAPI Hate, a West Coast-based collective founded last spring in response to the pandemic, reported
2,808 ""hate incidents"" nationwide aimed at Asian Americans from March through December 2020. For months
leading to the November election, Trump sought to deflect blame over his management of the pandemic
response by blaming China and using xenophobic and racist language to describe the virus on social media, in
televised interviews and at campaign rallies and White House coronavirus task force briefings.
The group said verbal harassment made up 71 percent of the incidents, while physical assaults made up
about 9 percent. Organizers said the effort has helped raise media awareness and drawn celebrities to amplify
the message, but some experts cautioned that the data is largely unvetted.
""It's incredibly important for organizations to provide those kinds of narratives about the impact of hate, but
at the end of the day it's anecdotal and cannot displace the onus on our government to provide accurate
data,"" said Maya Berry, executive director of the Arab American Institute, which helped draft early versions of
the No Hate legislation.
John C. Yang, executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-AAJC, which has collected self-reported incidents of anti-Asian bias since 2017, said his group also has tallied a spike in the past year. But he acknowledged that it is difficult for advocacy organizations to adequately analyze such information.
""Some recent incidents, whether they are anti-Asian or something else, is hard to tell,"" Yang said. ""As the
pandemic has worn on, the economic disparity has really played out and the physical and mental anxieties
are playing out as well, and it's probably all contributing.""",8572
Asian Americans are feeling under attack and largely alone,"Liu, Marian; Hatzipanagos, Rachel",Washington Post,2021-02-26,"They gather almost every night at San Francisco's Dragon Gate, the ornately decorated entrance to the nation's
oldest Chinatown. Armed with only whistles and pamphlets, the volunteer neighborhood patrol roams the
streets, checking out ATMs and mom-and-pop shops in areas where Asian residents have experienced attacks
that have left this neighborhood on edge.
Some volunteers drive more than an hour to walk these blocks - largely deserted by a combination of fear and
pandemic lockdown - to hand out bilingual fliers that explain how to report a crime to police. Similar patrols
have sprouted in Asian neighborhoods in Oakland, Calif., Los Angeles and New York City, a response to what
these communities say is a wave of racist violence and harassment since headlines about a virus from China
began appearing in U.S. media a year ago.
Data is scant, but at least two U.S. cities logged an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans in 2020.
The New York Police Department reported at least 28 hate crimes that targeted Asian American victims last year,
compared with three the previous year. San Francisco's preliminary data shows that nine hate crimes targeted
Asian Americans in 2020, up from six the year before and four in 2018.
Several viral videos of attacks on Asian pedestrians this month have heightened concerns: a Filipino man
slashed with a box cutter on a New York City train; a 52-year-old woman shoved to the ground in Flushing,
Queens; a woman punched in the face on a New York subway platform; and a Los Angeles man beaten with his
own cane at a bus stop.
It's unclear whether the violence in each of those viral videos was racially motivated, but the incidents have left
Asian Americans feeling not only under attack but also largely alone in addressing neighborhood crime, with
many of the assailants remaining elusive. While some residents have joined neighborhood patrols, others are
arming themselves for protection. And still others have pushed for law enforcement to create task forces and
liaisons to better address neighborhood concerns.
""People are fed up about not being heard, not being seen and waiting for help,"" said Will Lex Ham, an activist
who has participated in the San Francisco Chinatown street patrols and organized rallies in New York. ""We're not
getting the allyship we need, the resources we need. We have to pick ourselves up by the bootstraps.""
Public attention to attacks on Asian Americans soared after 84-year-old Vicha Ratanapakdee was assaulted in
San Francisco last month. According to his son-in-law Eric Lawson, he was on his daily neighborhood walk and
recovering from multiple heart surgeries when he was shoved so violently that he later died.
""Thai grandpa,"" as he was known by community activists, became a rallying cry for celebrities and other Asian
Americans who added his face to their social media profile pictures. His daughter Amy Ratanapakdee believes it
was a hate crime.
""It's like a senseless act of violence and could happen to any one of us,"" she said, adding that her own children
have been called racial epithets on the street during the past year. ""I want everyone to know how my father
died and hope that in his memory, people will join me to hope that justice presides.""
A 19-year-old man has pleaded not guilty to murder in Ratanapakdee's attack. And a suspect has been arrested
in the case of Noel Quintana, the 61-year-old Filipino man whose face was slashed on a New York City subway
train as he traveled to work earlier this month.
""Nobody came, nobody helped, nobody made a video,"" he said.
Quintana reported the crime to police, and the suspect has been charged with assault. But many cases never
get that far.
Victims from marginalized communities can be reluctant to engage with police because of cultural differences,
language barriers or distrust. Even when they do report, proving that they were targeted because of their race is
difficult.
To fill in the data gap, some Asian American organizations are tracking these incidents on their own. Stop AAPI
Hate was launched last March to collect information on suspected cases of racially motivated violence and
harassment. (AAPI stands for Asian American Pacific Islander.) It received more than 2,808 self-reported
incidents from across the country by year's end.
Of those incidents, 9 percent were physical assaults and 71 percent were verbal attacks. Among the victims,
most were women, and about 126 reported being older than 60.
""We were flooded immediately with hundreds of incidents,"" said Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian American
studies at San Francisco State University, who helped launch the site. ""We have large numbers of elderly
reporting that you wouldn't think would complain, but they knew racism when they experienced it.""
Of the self-reported victims, 41 percent were Chinese, 15 percent were Korean, 8 percent were Vietnamese and
7 percent were Filipino. States with higher Asian populations report more incidents, with California most represented followed by New York at about 13 percent.
But some Asian communities suspect that the rash of attacks is even worse than the data suggests. The
tendency to underreport is why Iona Cheng thinks her community in Oakland has become a target.
""They're attacking Asian women, often for cultural reasons. They don't speak out. They don't press charges.
They don't speak English well in some cases,"" said Cheng, who is Chinese American.
The 48-year-old cancer epidemiologist had just delivered a Christmas gift in late December when a group of
preteens tackled her to the ground, punched and robbed her. Police believe the same group stomped on an
Asian woman in her 60s later that night, breaking her kneecap.
""I can't walk outside the door of my house and feel safe,"" said Cheng, who added that someone called her
""coronavirus"" while she was jogging last March in Oakland. ""I just feel like that was taken from me.""
Gun ownership has become a solution for some. David Liu, owner of Arcadia Firearm and Safety in the
predominantly Asian city of Arcadia, Calif., said his 2020 sales soared four times higher than in a typical year.
Liu said he saw an uptick in Asian Americans interested in purchasing firearms, but interest has been
skyrocketing among ""basically everybody.""
National gun sales are not tracked by race or ethnicity, but in a survey by the National Shooting Sports
Foundation last year, gun retailers estimated a nearly 43 percent average increase in sales to Asian customers
in the first half of 2020 - the smallest jump among the four reported racial or ethnic groups. By comparison,
the survey estimated an average sales increase of 52 percent to White customers and 58 percent to Black
customers.
San Francisco social worker Jason Gee decided to buy a handgun in the spring after a series of incidents that
included an assault, a home invasion and the breaking of his car windows. And on his way to buy the gun, in
the parking lot, four White men called him and his friend ""the coronavirus"" and ""chinks.""
While in line to buy the firearm, Gee said, he noticed that most of the customers were also Asian.
But he soon started to worry that his purchase was ""playing to fear"" and ultimately making his community
less safe, and decided to sell the firearm back.
""If you show up here . . . expecting violence, that may put you in a certain mind frame where you may
misread a situation and respond to it with violence.""
Local leaders have made similar pleas, including Oakland Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong, who expressed
concern about civilian gun owners creating ""unintended victims.""
He held a news conference on Feb. 16 after a Chinatown shopkeeper was jailed for allegedly firing his weapon
at a man he believed was robbing a woman on the street. ""We don't want people to fire weapons into our
community,"" he said. ""While we appreciated people's interest in keeping our community safe, we want them
to observe and report.""
That sentiment makes San Francisco gun owner Chris Cheng furious. Cheng, who describes himself as a
Second Amendment advocate, has owned a gun since 2008 and said friends and strangers have been
reaching out to him about gun ownership in response to the attacks.
""I think a lot of Asian Americans are realizing that the police can only do so much and that the police are not
always there to protect us,"" Cheng said. ""They're only there to take the report.""
Some law enforcement agencies have been trying to do more. Police departments in San Francisco and New York City have set up task forces to focus on the issue and increased police presence in predominantly
Asian neighborhoods.
The 25 detectives on the NYPD's all-Asian task force speak 11 languages among them. In July, when an
89-year-old woman whose face had been slapped and shirt set on fire didn't initially cooperate with the
investigation, Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo, commanding officer of the task force, sent a detective who
speaks Cantonese to talk to her.
""She saw him, and it was like seeing her grandkids or something like that. She opened up,"" Loo said. ""The
details [she gave] were very precise, very clear. And from that interview, she was able to ID the people
that tried lighting her on fire, which led to an arrest.""
At least 18 people have been arrested in suspected hate crimes against Asian Americans in New York since
the attacks began in 2020, Loo said.
Many have placed blame for anti-Asian violence on former president Donald Trump, who repeatedly called
the coronavirus the ""China virus"" and ""kung flu"" during his time in office. The Anti-Defamation League
found that anti-Asian sentiment on Twitter spiked after Trump's October covid-19 diagnosis. Even before
that, about a third of Americans in a survey released in April reported witnessing someone blame Asian
people for the pandemic.
But Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) says the problem runs deeper than the former president. During House
Democrats' roundtable discussion Friday about the attacks, Takano noted that ""this sort of bias is latent
throughout American society, and it gets worse or less worse depending on the moment.""
As far back as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which banned Chinese laborers from immigrating to the
United States, insidious ideas about Asian people's influence have fueled racist sentiments in the country.
The act was a product of the ""yellow peril,"" a paranoia that Chinese immigrants were a threat to White
Americans' jobs and other aspects of Western life.
These ideas carried into the 20th century, when Chinese American Vincent Chin was fatally beaten in
Detroit in 1982 after two men allegedly mistook him for Japanese, a group that was being blamed for the
decline of U.S. automakers. Chin's assailants received a fine and probation for his death.
Tensions between Asian and Black communities also date back decades and have been reignited by videos
that show Black perpetrators in many of the recent attacks on Asian Americans. Those tensions are rooted
in the proximity in which the two under-resourced communities often live and work, while ""fighting for
crumbs,"" said John C. Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice in
Washington.
That mutual suspicion has boiled over several times in recent history. In 1991, a Korean American
convenience store owner in Los Angeles accused 15-year-old Latasha Harlins of shoplifting before fatally
shooting her. The shopkeeper was convicted of voluntary manslaughter but served no jail time. A year
later, the acquittal of the Los Angeles police officers who beat Rodney King set off riots in the city, during
which many Korean shops were burned and looted.
""There was a sense that the shopkeepers were not respectful of the Black clientele, didn't trust the Black
clientele, and also overcharged the Black clientele,"" said Brenda Stevenson, a history professor at UCLA
and author of ""The Contested Murder of Latasha Harlins: Justice, Gender and the Origins of the L.A. Riots.""
""On the other side, the Korean American shopkeepers at the time felt that the clientele were dangerous
and untrustworthy. Some of them had been assaulted, some had been killed.""
As the coronavirus pandemic has saddled low-income communities with economic hardships, community callouts and social media posts seeking volunteers to help protect business owners and older residents
have proliferated in Asian American neighborhoods. The volunteer patrols pass out whistles so residents
can alert others to active crimes, and offer to walk with older neighbors as they run errands.
""Our community is hurting,"" said Kevin Chan, owner of Golden Gate Fortune Cookie, which has been a
stop for the San Francisco patrol. The Chinatown shop has been open for 58 years, but business has
declined by 80 percent since the pandemic, Chan said.
""Everybody is worried about what's happening, not just me, everybody in the community,"" he said.
""Because they just want to make a living and then people are attacking them just because they have a
store or they're walking on the street.""
When it comes to anti-Asian sentiment, there are no boundaries to who could become a victim, said Tzi
Ma, known as Hollywood's go-to Asian father. The actor, in his 60s, said he was yelled at by a passerby
in a car to ""be quarantined"" while in a Whole Foods parking lot in Pasadena, Calif., at the beginning of
the pandemic, before the shutdowns.

We can't answer bigotry with bigotry,"Wang, Andrew",Washington Post,2021-02-24,"There used to be a Jeep parked in my family's garage. A dirty, muted silver, with a box of repair tools in the
back seat, it was an American kind of eyesore that screamed of rugged determination. My great-uncle, who left
Zhejiang, China, to be with us in Houston, drove it proudly until January 2007, when he was shot and killed by
men in ski masks while out on a walk with my great-aunt.
Until the surge in attacks on Asian Americans recently made the national spotlight, I had tried to forget. After
all, my family toiled for more than a decade to bury the trauma, and to an extent it worked. My younger sister
did not know the whole truth until I told her prior to the publication of this column.
This past year, as anti-Asian hate crimes significantly increased, Asian Americans had known what was coming.
When then-President Donald Trump called covid-19 the ""China virus,"" we saw a warning where others saw a
misnomer. We urgently shared reports of violent incidents through native language apps, including WeChat and
KakaoTalk, and Facebook groups such as Subtle Asian Traits. Last March, reminiscent of ""the talk"" that Black
parents often give their children about facing law enforcement, my mother warned me not to wear a mask until
it became common practice, fearing it would make me a target.
In April, a Brooklyn woman suffered severe burns after being doused with chemicals. Last month, 84-year-old Thai immigrant Vicha Ratanapakdee died in an assault in San Francisco. Noel Quintana, a 61-year-old Filipino
man riding the New York subway this month, required about 100 stitches after being slashed with a box cutter.
Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition documenting anti-Asian hate amid covid-19, has tracked more than 2,800 incidents
of violence, harassment or discrimination between March and December 2020, many aimed at the elderly.
Activists say the true numbers are surely higher.
But beneath calls for advocacy and safety, some conversations circulating within Asian American communities
are troubling. Across online platforms, video footage showing Black men as the perpetrators in some attacks has
spawned greater anti-Black sentiment even as nationwide protests in defense of Black lives continue. A Subtle
Asian Traits post detailing the attacks prompted comments accusing Black Lives Matter supporters of
indifference. On Reddit and Twitter, users have repopularized a 2010 article calling ""black-on-Asian violence"" San
Francisco's ""dirty secret.""
I urge my fellow Asian Americans to reject these narratives. We cannot answer racism with racism.
We should know as well as anyone where such arguments from anecdote can lead. The better impulse is to
examine how the potential for conflict was historically built into our communities. Political scientist Claire Jean
Kim has described Asian American identity as partly formed by a ""racial triangulation"" process beginning in the
mid-19th century, when Chinese workers began immigrating en masse to California. The economic boom there
created demand for cheap labor, and White political and business elites valorized Asian immigrants over Blacks.
Asians fulfilled an economic need while simultaneously being disadvantaged as aliens removed from the claims
to American-ness increasingly being asserted by Black leaders.
As Kim argues, this formula continues to generate conflict today. It can be seen, for instance, in the affirmative
action debate whenever Asian Americans are weaponized as a perceived success story against Black Americans'
critiques of structural discrimination.
But racial conflict between Asian and Black Americans is certainly not inevitable. Organizations such as the Dear
Asians Initiative have translated letters about Black Lives Matter into 12 languages to challenge anti- Blackness
and promote dialogue within our communities. In Oakland, Calif., hundreds of Black and Asian community
members recently rallied in solidarity. Sociologist Jennifer Lee, in her book ""Civility in the City,"" shows that
despite flash points such as the Los Angeles riots of 1992, the city's Korean and Black communities have
typically worked to make civility more common than conflict. As Asian Americans, we can protect ourselves and
seek accountability without becoming conduits for racism.
After my great-uncle's death, we promptly sold the Jeep. We later left Texas for a wealthier Asian enclave east
of Los Angeles. We never found out who killed him.
The pain endures, but I wonder now if knowing would have eased it or risked contorting our grief into hatred. To
try to make sense of the senseless is human, but whoever the perpetrators were - and whatever race they were
- they represented no one but themselves. And so we must be careful in our heartbreak. Inequality in America
is a disease with many expressions. Only by rooting out our shared suffering can we protect the beautiful,
manifold lives of our loved ones.",4896
'I've never seen it so quiet': Chinatown restaurateurs face financial ruin: It's a precarious situation for a neighborhood that has long caught the eye of developers,"Kohli, Diti",Boston Globe,2020-04-14,"At China King last month, the phone rarely rang.
“One day, there was nothing,"" said owner Doris Huang of a day without a single order. “Nobody at all. I have never seen it so quiet.""
The rent for her modest Chinatown restaurant is past due. One employee remains on the payroll, and Huang's small pool of savings ebbs lower each day. The money China King
needs to stay afloat is simply not there, and there's no sign profits will start pouring in soon. So Huang closed her beloved 25-year-old restaurant last week — at least
temporarily — after sparring with the decision for a while.
Eateries across the state, like China King, are suffering under necessary distancing guidelines and barely staving off financial ruin during COVID-19. In response, restaurateurs
have implemented cost-cutting measures, including truncated hours, shortened menus, and widespread layoffs.
But a slew of recent restaurant closures in Chinatown signals an especially dire financial future for the historic neighborhood.
“This is going to be a long haul for everyone,"" said Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu. “But there is especially pain in the Asian-American community in Boston and across the
country.""
Decades-old institutions — Taiwan Cafe and Su Su Gourmet, for example — have boarded up their doors for the foreseeable future. Banquet halls usually enlivened by Lunar
New Year celebrations until late April are deserted. A once-bustling Beach Street is eerily quiet.
The nearly 20 Chinatown restaurants continuing business in mid-March has been reduced to a dozen or fewer, according to Boston Chinatown Tours founder Jacqueline Church.
Per a spreadsheet run by a local advocacy group, Chinatown Main Street, a number of spots are still serving through third-party delivery apps, who receive a chunk of the
revenue from each order. (The list is run by volunteers and was last updated on April 10.)
Joe Wong, a member of the Chinatown Main Street board of directors, said some places have stayed open in the hopes of using meats and vegetables that would otherwise spoil — an even greater financial loss than their operating costs.
It's a precarious situation for a neighborhood that has long caught the eye of property owners and developers looking to take advantage of its central location.
“There's been a long fight to keep Chinatown affordable and not displace the residents and the businesses that make the community special,"" said Wu. “There has been rampant
speculation because it is so close to downtown, and the appetite for luxury development there is very high. . . . This certainly adds more stress.""
Huang's analysis of the situation was simpler.
“It's bad,"" she said. ""Very, very bad.""
Chinatown restaurateurs felt the initial financial fallout from the disease as early as February, when fears of coronavirus began to circulate. The fact that the illness originated in
China's Hubei Province scared potential customers, driving restaurant sales down by 50 percent or more.
Local officials and residents rallied patrons to come back for shumai and congee with Dim Sum Brunches and desperate pleas online. Since then, multiple restaurants boosted by
those efforts have closed, said Wu. Even China Pearl, the host of a widely attended event on Feb. 15, shuttered later that month. Its Quincy location transitioned to delivery and
then to pickup only, which it offers during a four-hour window midday.
Now the rise in anti-Asian sentiment and xenophobic attacks has only bolstered the economic downturn plaguing the restaurants.
“All the financial factors are compounded by the stirring racism,"" said Church, a longtime resident of Chinatown. “Everybody's concerned about the so-called 'Chinese Virus.' ""
Many restaurateurs have been on the hunt for small-business relief programs that could ease their spiraling financial woes. But quick deadlines, language barriers, and
documentation issues pose a litany of hurdles for Chinatown's business owners, many of whom are immigrants desperate for aid.
Chinatown Main Street organizers host virtual panels for restaurant owners and offer translated information on city, state, and federal assistance. Wong said the efforts are
necessary to get the neighborhood back on its feet.
“I don't know of any permanent closures . . . most people are still hopeful,"" he said. “We are doing a lot more than the other Main Street branches to make sure that stays that
way.""
Huang herself had trouble finding information as her revenue dries up and her bills add up. She enlisted her son's help, but she said he can't find anything to pull her out of the
hole.
Burdened by stress, Huang worries about reopening China King once the virus subsides.
“I'm scared. Everybody's scared,"" she said. “I hope that the coronavirus passes soon and fast, and Chinatown comes back.""",4797
Racist 'Zoom-bombing' invades Chinese class at Newton South High,"Berg, Matt",Boston Globe,2020-04-16,"On Wednesday morning, a Newton South High School advanced placement Chinese class was underway on Zoom when hackers
infiltrated the group, posting “vile, hate-filled images and speech"" directed at the students, officials said.
The incident, which lasted about three minutes, was part of a phenomenon known as “Zoom-bombing,"" when a Zoom call is hacked into
by individuals who disrupt a meeting. It was also an example, school officials said, of coronavirus-related racism that has run rampant
since the beginning of the pandemic, often directed at the Asian community.
Joel Stembridge, Newton South's principal, wrote to the school community Thursday morning, calling the episode “clearly racist,
hateful, and horrible.""
“This was a traumatic experience for our teacher and students, and we will continue to offer support to everyone involved,"" Stembridge
said via e-mail. “To be clear, an attack on members of our NSHS Asian-American community is an attack on all of us. We will be working
on a plan for responding — I will share more about this soon.""
All Zoom meetings scheduled for Thursday were canceled, allowing the IT department and staff to check security protocols. Classes
were to resume Friday, said Julie McDonough, a school spokeswoman.
“Our counseling staff is reaching out to every student today,"" McDonough said. “We are scheduling a meeting with student leaders and
teachers to plan a response. Hate speech and racism have no place at South and won't be tolerated.""
School officials notified students' families and local police, who were investigating. Teachers and students were working with officials to
gather information about the intruders, who did not appear to be associated with the high school, according to Stembridge's e-mail.
The intruders may have accessed the meeting through a link to the call that was created before security updates were made in recent
weeks, Stembridge said. Hundreds of calls had been successful prior to the incident, he added.
The intrusion comes as millions of people adopt the online platform for work or education. Since the pandemic started, Zoom has
struggled to keep up with security features to prevent such incidents.
After two Massachusetts schools reported “Zoom-bombing"" in March, FBI officials in Boston urged users to take security precautions,
such as sending links to participants directly instead of posting links in publicly available areas and making sure users have the most
current version of Zoom's teleconferencing software.
“This is a trying time for all of us, and events such as these underscore the fragility of this new environment in which we are working,""
Stembridge wrote. “We'll have more work to do to ensure that we can continue to support students and build a safe, connected online
community.""",2784
'I've never felt so targeted': Asian Americans on edge after house break-ins in Newton ,"Hilliard, John; Lusignan, Kate ",Boston Globe,2021-07-14,"NEWTON - Members of the Asian American community remained on edge Wednesday as investigators worked to determine whether a string of five house break-ins over the past month targeted residents of Asian descent. 
While no one was hurt during any of the daytime break-ins, which occurred on weekends while residents were away, the crimes have left many deeply concerned that there is a racial motivation behind the thefts. 
""It makes me feel unsafe. In the 40-plus years I've lived in Newton, I've never felt so targeted,"" said Mona SooHoo Wong. ""This guy has been running around, breaking into homes, and does so during the daylight -- he has no problems getting in."" 
Local leaders, including Newton Police Chief John F. Carmichael Jr. and Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan, will attend a community meeting Thursday at 8 p.m. to address residents' concerns. Officials have said they don't want to cause unnecessary alarm. 
But some residents believe the city and police must do more to keep the public informed, including Scott Chin, whose Dedham Street home was broken into on June 19. 
""At this point, I think it's safe to say it's definitely targeting Asians,"" Chin said. ""Things are going a little bit slow in getting the word out."" 
The break-ins, which began June 13 in the area of the 900 block of Walnut Street, also included Helene Road on June 20; and the area of the 700 block of Quinobequin Road on June 27. Police have said the most recent break-in was Sunday on Country Club Road. 
On Wednesday, Carmichael told reporters at Newton Police headquarters that investigators have not found any further connections between the families, other than their race and that they were away from their homes for short, weekend trips. 
""The commonalities [are] that these are Asian families, but there's nothing to indicate that there is any hate crime associated at this time. We will obviously look into that further,"" Carmichael said. 
Ryan said her office's anti-bias task force is working on the investigation. ""We are always looking at any crimes that are happening, particularly when you see a pattern like this, with a racial equity lens,"" Ryan said. 
The thefts also come amid a nationwide plague of anti-Asian hate and violence. Bigotry toward people of Asian descent is on the rise, and Asian Americans have reported more incidents of harassment and racism than in the past. In March, victims of a deadly mass shooting in Atlanta included several women of Asian descent. 
Mayor Ruthanne Fuller recognized the national increase in anti-Asian sentiments. ""Our Asian community and the AAPI community has been reeling in the last 18 months,"" Fuller said. 
Newton has been the scene of 45 residential break-ins so far this year, including two previous series of house breaks in March and April. Three men were arrested as part of the investigations into those break-ins, and there was no indication that anyone was specifically targeted, according to police. 
There were 19 break-ins at this point in 2020, according to Carmichael, and 35 break-ins by this time in 2019. 
The most recent thefts in Newton all involved forced entry into the homes, and focused on jewelry, cash, and handbags, according to police. 
Investigators are also asking for the public's help to identify a person photographed in video surveillance at the time of the break-ins on Dedham Street and Helene Road. In the photos, the person wore a black hat and light-colored mask. 
Anyone with information is asked to call the Newton Police Department Detective Bureau at 617-796-2104 or use the anonymous tips line at 617-796-2121. 
Greer Tan Swiston, the chairwoman of the Greater Boston Chinese Cultural Association and a former Newton alderwoman, said community groups in the Boston area had discussed how they haven't experienced the kind of Asian-targeted crimes reported elsewhere in the country. 
These recent break-ins may change that perception. 
""We have been feeling proud that our neighbors and our community wasn't like that,"" Swiston said. ""So I feel like having this happen makes us feel [as though] we're aren't in as friendly a community as we thought."" 
Anping Shen, the founding president of the Chinese American Association of Newton and a member of the city's School Committee, praised the response to the recent break-ins by the mayor and police. 
Shen said he hopes the city will mobilize resources to enhance the security of local homes, including those of Asian American residents. ""I hope this is a wake-up call for many people here and we have to do something,"" Shen said. 
Wong said the recent string of break-ins have her worried and left feeling on edge. The homes of Wong's relatives, including Chin, were targeted in two of the five break- ins. Wong now keeps her windows shut, and is concerned for her family's safety. 
""A lot of my friends feel the same way should we leave the house?"" she said. 
Chin, who was raised in Newton, said his home's surveillance system recorded images of the suspect, who broke in by smashing open a glass patio door while the house was empty. 
The suspect stole jewelry that was passed down to Chin and his wife from their families. The property taken had great sentimental value, especially for Chin, whose parents died from COVID-19 during the pandemic. 
""Not only were we dealing with that... but this hits us,"" Chin said. ""That can't be replaced.""

Coalition of students urge school leaders around Boston to address anti-Asian racism,"Pan, Deanna",Boston Globe,2020-09-29,"The coronavirus pandemic has unleashed an explosion of anti-Asian racism in the United States, ranging from
derogatory slurs, to blaming the outbreak on Chinese people, to violent physical attacks. In an open letter to
school leaders in Boston, Quincy, and Malden, a coalition of Asian-American students and their supporters is
urging educators to take action now to ensure their safety as a new school year begins.“In school, we feel we are not equal to other students. Whether it be among our peers, with faculty members in-
person or online, it is suffocating to know there are those who look at us cautiously and choose to ignore therising issue of xenophobia in the U.S.,” the letter said. “Our mental health is deteriorating, and our grades will
drop, impacting our futures in higher education. We feel unsafe returning to schools with unaddressed racism.”
Asian Americans have endured an onslaught of bullying and abuse in the months since the coronavirus outbreak
erupted in China. Stop AAPI Hate, an initiative of several California-based Asian American civil rights
organizations, has tracked more than 2,500 hate incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders
between mid-March and early August, including reports of workplace discrimination, online harassment, and
physical assaults.
Stop AAPI Hate recorded 61 such incidents in Massachusetts.
Civil rights groups, such as the Anti-Defamation League, have accused President Trump and public officials of exacerbating anti-Asian sentiment by referring to COVID-19 as “the Chinese virus” or “kung flu.”
The open letter, posted Sept. 21, has garnered more than 60 online signatures from students, teachers, parents,
and community members in and around Boston. Seventeen-year-old Sarah Xu, one of the six students who
coauthored the letter, organized the campaign through the nonprofit Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center.
She got the idea from a class at Boston Latin School, where she's now a senior, called “Facing History and
Ourselves."" The class, Xu said, examines “the unspoken narratives of different oppressed populations."" Shortly
before Boston schools closed, the class began discussing the recent surge of anti-Asian prejudice. With help
from the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center, she and the other students started drafting the letter this
spring. They finished polishing it just in time for the new school year.
“I was definitely afraid and anxious because this has never happened in my lifetime so far,"" Xu said in an
interview Monday, regarding the troubling rise in anti-Asian bigotry. “I'm thankful for the fact that I haven't
personally been attacked yet and I'm also in a community that keeps me safe.”
But in March, Xu still detected tension in her classes at Boston Latin, where roughly 30 percent of the students
are of Asian descent.
“It did feel uncomfortable at times when people would talk about COVID,"" she said. ""People couldn't help but
look at the Asians in the room.”
In the letter, the students described being stared at while walking down the street or riding the train. They
cannot go to the grocery store, they wrote, “without fear of strangers harassing us.""
“For me, I'm Chinese, so I wore masks very early,” 17-year-old Xi Zheng, a senior at North Quincy High School
and one of letter writers, told the Globe. She said she's afraid of leaving her home and “being attacked by a
racist.”
“People look at me very strangely,"" she continued, “and I feel very uncomfortable.”
The students asked school leaders “to stand in solidarity with communities of color” by publicly speaking out
against racism; hiring more diverse faculty and staff; hosting monthly anti-bias trainings; and teaching Ethnic
Studies. They also requested a system for “reporting incidents of racism,"" and listening sessions and healing
circles for students and families.
Letter writer Mandy Sun, who is also 17 and a senior at Boston Latin, said racism against Asian Americans is
“normalized,"" which she hadn't fully realized until the pandemic began. She recalled an incident in the spring,
when a white student at a nearby suburban high school wrote a scathing Facebook post blaming the virus on
Chinese people. Despite the student's outburst, her school didn't reprimand her, Sun said, because the student
later apologized on social media.
“It made me feel, at first, angry, and I started thinking, 'How are we going to move on from this? How are we
going to create a better society?' I feel like the only people who got outraged were in the Asian-American
community,"" Sun said. The episode left her feeling “slightly hopeless.”
Boston Public Schools spokesman Jonathan Palumbo said the district is reviewing the letter and working on a
response to the students. In an interview with the Globe on Tuesday, Malden Public Schools superintendent John
Oteri reiterated the district's commitment to anti-racism teaching and training.
“I think when you're doing anti-racism, anti-bias [work], you're trying to undo generations and, frankly,
centuries of systemic oppression. It's going to take awhile and it's always going to be a work in progress,” he
said. “I want to make Malden the most equitable, welcoming, inclusive school community, where people feel like
they belong.”
The superintendent of Quincy Public Schools, Kevin Mulvey, did not return requests for comment.
“Young people are very much concerned about these issues and very much want to use their voice to make
change, so this was a way for them to do that,” said Ben Hires, CEO of the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood
Center, who signed onto the letter as a supporter. “To me, it's just inspiring to see these young people use
their voices in this way.""",5691
"'We have heavy hearts tonight': Amid a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, people mourn the lives lost in Georgia","Larson, Shannon",Boston Globe,2021-03-17,"A horrific spate of shootings in Georgia on Tuesday has left eight people dead, many of them women of Asian
descent, at a time when reported anti-Asian hate crimes have skyrocketed over the course of the coronavirus
pandemic.
The shootings occurred at two massage parlors in Atlanta and one in the suburbs. A 21-year-old male suspect
was taken into custody hours after a manhunt, police said.
On social media, members of the Asian American community shared personal testimonials of the blatant racism
and microaggressions they have faced in their lifetime, precautions they have taken in the wake of recent
attacks, and words of grief following the killings.
While the motive of the suspect — a white man — has not yet been determined, many have drawn a connection
between the rise in crimes against Asian Americans throughout the pandemic and the shooting deaths of the
women he allegedly killed.
The organization Asian Americans Advancing Justice noted while there is “much to learn tonight” about the
shootings in Georgia, many of the “victims are Asian, calling into question if this is related to recent hate crimes
and assaults against Asian Americans.”
“We have heavy hearts tonight as we mourn eight people who have lost their lives in a senseless act of
violence,” the organization wrote on Twitter.
An analysis released by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San
Bernardino, which looked at police department statistics across the United States, revealed that the nation saw
a considerable hike in anti-Asian hate crimes last year in numerous major cities.
The study examined hate crimes in 16 of America's major cities, and found that while such crimes decreased by
7 percent in 2020, those committed against Asian Americans surged by nearly 150 percent. In Boston, hate
crimes rose from six reported in 2019 to 14 reported in 2020, according to the analysis, equivalent to a 133
percent rise.
In New York Tuesday night, NYPD Assistant Chief Martine Materasso said the department deployed Critical
Response Command units to Asian communities.
“While there is no known nexus to #NYC we will be deploying assets to our great Asian communities across the
city out of an abundance of caution,” Materasso wrote on Twitter.
Late Tuesday night, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp weighed in on the tragedies, expressing sympathy for those
affected.
“Our entire family is praying for the victims of these horrific acts of violence,” Kemp wrote on Twitter.
Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock said his heart “is broken tonight after the tragic violence in Atlanta that took
eight lives.”
“Once again we see that hate is deadly,” Warnock wrote on Twitter. “Praying for the families of the victims and
for peace for the community.”
Some were quick to note the role former president Donald Trump may have played in spurring anti-Asian
sentiments. At the beginning of the pandemic — and as recently as Tuesday evening during a televised interview
on Fox News — Trump used racist language targeting Asian Americans and the Chinese community.
He has referred to the coronavirus as “the China virus” and “kung flu,” racist slurs that quickly became a rallying
cry for his supporters.
President Biden acknowledged the violence committed against Asian Americans less than a week ago, saying,
“It's wrong. It's un-American. And it must stop.”
Yet many Asian Americans shared that racism, whether overt or in the form of microaggressions, has been
present throughout the course of their lives. And others online said America's history and policies have long
pointed to racial injustice toward the community.
Activist Timothy Phan wrote on Twitter that “if your automatic response to anti-Asian violence in #atlanta today
is blame Donald Trump, you haven't done enough to process the history of anti-Asian xenophobia in this
country's wretched history towards working-class immigrants of color.”
Alton Wang, a J.D. candidate at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law, said that growing up, his
“ever cautious dad” always chided him to be observant and alert of his surroundings — a “critical reminder now.”
“That the shooter targeted Asian women is not a coincidence,” Wang wrote on Twitter. “The misogynistic racism
directed at Asian women is evident not just on platforms like Twitter, but in history — the roots of our broken,
racist immigration system began by banning entry of Chinese women under the Page Act.”
Imani Perry, the Hughes-Rogers Professor of African American Studies at Princeton University, said she
teaches a class on race in legal history.
Throughout the course, Perry said, she always educates her students on Asian American history “because you
cannot teach serious history of US law as an instrument of racial injustice without the history of Asian
Americans.”
“And today, the patterns of racial violence that are predicated on a notion of Asian Americans as 'not
belonging' are directly tied to that history,” Perry wrote on Twitter. “I deeply hope that we can understand the
current horror of racist violence directed at Asian Americans as a product of a shameful history that must be
addressed directly.”
Nguyễn Anh Thư, of OCA–Asian Pacific American Advocates, said her mother, aunts, and herself have “been in
a steady state of tension this entire pandemic.”
“This is beyond terrifying. Now, not only are they risking infection when going to work at the nail salon, they
risk deadly targeted violence,” she wrote on Twitter. “I know those aestheticians — you know them too.”
But, she said, “I can't trust agencies that embody white supremacy to protect my family.”
Claire Tran, who will be joining the Washington Post as a social media editor, shared that the events in Atlanta
— for her and many of her friends — were reminiscent of their youth and the concerns they had for their
parents even then.
“I just want to send love to everyone who — like me and many friends — grew up sitting around our parents'
nail salon or restaurant, or nervously awaiting them to come home from an overnight shift at a convenience
store,” Tran wrote on Twitter.
“The worry,” she said, “never goes away.”",6155
"'It's a terrible scourge that's always been there' — Asian community in Mass. shaken by Atlanta slayings, spike in attacks","Ellement, John R; Sweeney, Emily",Boston Globe,2021-03-17,"The slayings of six Asian women at spas in the Atlanta area were seen Wednesday by some members of Massachusetts' Asian community as another expression of long-festering
racism — and part of a surge of anti-Asian violence since the coronavirus pandemic began.
Steven S. Kim, a Brighton defense attorney who emigrated from Korea with his family when he was 5 years old, said passing drivers routinely shout racial epithets at him, and
clients have rejected him because of his heritage.
“It's a terrible scourge that has always been there,'' said Kim, who was deployed to Afghanistan in 2011 as a member of the Massachusetts National Guard. “The undercurrent and
the underbelly of this country has always had that.”
He added: “There is this very tiring trope that Asian Americans have lived with for our entire existence here, whether you are first generation, second generation, third or forth.
And that's the consistent perception amongst the rest of the American population that we are foreigners. That we don't belong.”
Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu issued a statement decrying the shootings. Eight people in total were killed at three spas during the rampage, according to investigators. Seven
of the victims were women.
“I join our Asian American community in mourning, and solidarity, following the senseless shootings in the Atlanta area last night,” she wrote on her Twitter account Wednesday.
“It's heartbreaking & appalling to see the anti-Asian harassment, violence, and now mass murder that has accelerated over the past year.”
In her statement, Wu, an at-large city councilor who is a candidate to succeed Mayor Martin J. Walsh, said the incident was “part of a long history of racism in American that we
must all fight to end.”
“All too often, the most silenced members of our community — Asian American elders and women working in invisible industries — have borne the brunt of these attacks,” she
wrote.
Police said they arrested Robert Aaron Long, 21, after a brief manhunt following Tuesday's shootings. He confessed to the shootings during an interview with authorities and said
his actions were not racially motivated, police said.
Long was charged Wednesday with four counts of murder and one count of assault, officials said.
Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant said it was still early in the investigation and a determination had not yet been made whether it was a hate crime.
The killings come as crimes against Asian Americans have spiked across the United States. Since the start of the pandemic, Asian Americans reported nearly 3,800 hate-related
incidents in all 50 states, according to a report released Tuesday by Stop AAPI Hate, an organization that advocates for Asian and Pacific Islander Americans.
“The unconscionable blaming of Asian American communities for the devastation of this pandemic has reinforced the sense of invisibility and perpetual foreigner status that so
many of us have known our entire lives‚” Wu wrote.
The daughter of immigrants from Taiwan, Wu wrote about her own personal experiences, saying that “some of my most vivid childhood memories involve racist encounters with
strangers. People who knew nothing about me except for my appearance feeling empowered to pull eyes into slits, or to chant ching chong sounds.”
She said she knew “that constant feeling of needing to be aware, ready, on guard whenever out in public,” she said.
She added that ”since before COVID-19 was spreading in United States, Asian American communities have been on edge. Boston has not been immune these incidents.”
Vinh Bui, 36, of Dorchester, said he felt angry when he learned about what happened in Atlanta.
Bui was born in refugee camp and came to the United States when he was two months old. He grew up in Fields Corner and said throughout his childhood he experienced
discrimination firsthand for being part of what he called “the invisible minority.”
“I was bullied my entire childhood,” Bui said. “I was assaulted by older kids, and sometimes verbally assaulted by adults...As a kid I was spat on. I had black eyes and busted lips
growing up. I didn't know what a 'gook' was until they started calling me that.”
And then he started fighting back.
“We escaped war to enter another war,” he said.
The Asian and Pacific Islanders Civic Action Network said in a statement that the organization was “enraged and devastated” by the murders.
“Increased and unchecked anti-Asian rhetoric during the COVID-19 pandemic has fueled xenophobia and anti-Asian racism,” the statement said. “We have seen a rise in attacks on
Asian Americans, particularly elderly people, across the country, and a lack of safety in all aspects of our community members' lives.”
Women experience the brunt of this racism, according to the statement.
“Asian American women are on the frontlines of our economic sectors, including as domestic workers and nail salon workers,” the statement said. “Asian American women are also
the center of our family lives as homemakers and caretakers. Asian American women live simultaneously at the margins of society and at the intersection of immigration, gender,
race, and class.”
The Lowell Police Department issued a statement denouncing “the recent incidents of violence against members of the Asian community in other areas of the country” and said
that there would be an “increased police presence at locations and areas that could potentially be targeted.”
“Violence against individuals because of their race or background can never be tolerated,” Lowell Police Superintendent Raymond Kelly Richardson said in the statement. “Members
of the Asian Community in Lowell can rest assured that the Lowell Police Department stands with them and is taking proactive measures to deter such incidents in Lowell.”
The Massachusetts House of Representatives' Asian caucus members -- Donald Wong, Tackey Chan, Paul Schmid, Rady Mom, Maria Robinson, Tram Nguyen, Vanna Howard, and
Erika Uyterhoeven -- put out a joint statement Wednesday, condemning the violence in Atlanta and across the nation.
“As information continues to come out about the shootings and murders that took place in Atlanta last night, our community is left heartbroken,” the statement said. “Although we
are not surprised by this senseless violence, it is no less devastating. Violence against Asian Americans has been on the rise for over a year. We must acknowledge this fact and
work to address it. Our voices have historically been marginalized and ignored, and even with the rise in anti-Asian racism over the course of the last year, we continue to have to
fight to have them heard.”
Boston City Councilor Ed Flynn said he filed a hearing order for March 30 at 1 p.m. to talk about how the city can investigate and prevent incidents of hate crimes and
discrimination.
“It is deeply heartbreaking to hear about the deadly shootings that occurred in Atlanta, where most of the victims were women of Asian descent,” Flynn said in a statement. “My
heart goes out to the friends and families of the victims, and I hope that the perpetrator will be swiftly brought to justice. As the Boston City Councilor for District 2, I represent
the largest Chinese and AAPI community in Boston, which includes Chinatown, the South End, Bay Village, Back Bay, and South Boston. This is a resilient community, but this
community has faced significant levels of hate and discrimination since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. This latest incident illustrates just how malicious anti-Asian hate
can be, and how discrimination can turn into deadly violence. We need to support our AAPI neighbors, and we need to address the issue of anti-AAPI sentiments at the federal,
state, and local levels.”
In a posting on Twitter, Councilor Andrea Campbell, also a mayoral candidate, added her voice to concern about attacks on the Asian community.
“I am beyond disgusted and saddened by the horrific acts of violence in Georgia. Last year, we marched and demanded action against racism. Today, I stand with the AAPI [Asian
American and Pacific Islander] community and all those who are grieving” she wrote. “The growing violence against our Asian American residents in the US and our own City must
be addressed and that requires us all to not only acknowledge the root cause which is racism and anti-Asian sentiments, but to then do the hard work of eradicating it.”",8363

"After Atlanta killings, the fears grow: Asian-American merchants call for a commitment to denounce racism, violence",Georgia; Atlanta Georgia,Boston Globe,2021-03-22,"She always knew her business could be a potential target of anti-Asian hate, but didn't think much of it until earlier this month, when a customer uttered a racial slur to one of her employees.
“His wife came in and apologized, but it didn't make us feel that much better,"" she said. “We are an Asian brand, and our logo itself has Chinese characters. I'm worried about that.""
Her fears have been dramatically heightened since last week's shootings at three spas in Georgia, which left eight people dead, including six women of Asian descent. Like other Asian business owners, Vuong was devastated but, sadly, not surprised.
Many Asian-American business owners have been reeling from the downturn caused by the pandemic, and some are struggling with discrimination and cultural barriers that make it difficult to seek support. Some owners are calling for a commitment from civic leaders and the general public to acknowledge and denounce the rise in anti-Asian incidents, rather than trying to increase security measures around their businesses.
In response to the Georgia murders, Vuong said she and her husband held a staff meeting with their 14 employees to figure out how best to protect themselves. The group emerged from the conversation with new protocols, including a buddy system for when staff go outside to take out the trash or walk to their cars at the end of a shift.
“We're going to start checking up on each other to see if everyone got home safely or not,"" she said. Vuong added that running a new business is stressful enough, and the threat of harassment and violence makes it “overwhelming.""
Anti-Asian violence has sharply increased since the onset of COVID-19 and the xenophobic rhetoric used by Donald Trump and other politicians to blame China for its spread. Stop AAPI Hate, a national coalition formed to address anti-Asian discrimination during the pandemic, has received reports of 3,800 anti-Asian hate incidents since last March. The group found that businesses are the primary location where these incidents occur, followed by public streets and parks.
Ben Hires, chief executive of the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center, said the Atlanta shootings were “quite the gut punch.""
“I instantly thought about our staff and the people we support . . . The women that were tragically murdered in Atlanta . . . we know them, we serve them every day here locally,"" said Hires, who is of South Korean descent.
Hires said the killings underscore an ugly reality that many have ignored until now: that racism and prejudice have always targeted the Asian business community. He said business owners were already grappling with a loss of revenue due to xenophobia and Asians being scapegoated for the coronavirus, so the “violence adds another layer of fear.""
“Women in our community are on the front line of the business sectors . . . They are nail salon workers, restaurant workers, they are taking care of their families,"" he said. “Low-wage workers and even white-collar workers like myself . . . you are living through these days with a heightened sense of safety, being more aware of your surroundings.""
Thao Ho, who works as a paralegal and community organizer to support nail salon workers in Massachusetts, said the industry is staffed mostly by Vietnamese immigrants, some of whom are undocumented. One salon worker who has been putting in longer hours to earn enough to get by during the pandemic told her she's uneasy about traveling home later at night than she used to.
“The day after the murders . . . she told me she was really afraid of taking the subway,"" Ho said. “Although she can't actually point to any [violence against her], she feels in her heart that it is a necessity to even switch train cars so that she is not by herself.""
A business owner in Chinatown, who declined to provide his name for fear of being targeted, said he feels especially anxious when walking down poorly lit streets at night. A drop in foot traffic due to the pandemic hasn't helped.
“I would be lying if I say I have no concerns or fear,"" he said through a translator. “It seems like the racial tension is on the rise.""
The Metropolitan Area Planning Council is in the midst of a months-long effort to reach small businesses owned by Asian immigrants, with the goal of making policy recommendations on how local governments can better serve the community. Some of the recommendations, announced in a presentation Wednesday, include more translation services for business owners so they can better access resources, as well as a commitment from local governments to denounce xenophobia and racism against the Asian American community.
The MAPC, which plans to formally present its recommendations to officials in the coming weeks, also suggested the state invest in tracking and researching anti-Asian acts of hate and violence. 
Some cities have already said they would increase their police presence in Asian communities following the shootings.
But Hires said that some Asian business owners may find it difficult to report acts of racism or violence if they do not speak English well.
“Imagine trying to communicate through a system that may not feel welcoming,"" he said. “I think everyone wants to have issues addressed, but people are probably weighing a feeling of whether they will be taken seriously.""
Karen Chen, the head of Boston's Chinese Progressive Association, an advocacy group, said increased police patrolling will go only so far in solving the problem.
“Those are temporary solutions,"" she said. “Long-term, the economic viability of people in the community is important."" She added that some owners are more concerned with paying their rent and their employees than fighting systemic racism.
Ho said even though nail salon workers “know that there is xenophobia and anti-Asian racism being heightened at this time, they still have to think about the next day."" Language and 
legal-status barriers have hindered many from accessing the business and unemployment assistance they need.
Hires said he wants to see a “community response from people of all walks of life speaking up about this, stepping in and being an ally.""
“People who are marginalized may not be able to do something, but other people would be in a position to support,"" he said. “It would help the community feel safer.""",6326
There is no antiracist movement without fighting anti-Asian discrimination,"Osterheldt, Jeneé",Boston Globe,2021-03-04,"It happened in Chinatown first.
Before we had a single case in the city, before we had a mask mandate, before we had our first shut down, the
xenophobic stigma attached to coronavirus started to tear away at my neighborhood. Some businesses were
down by more than half by early February last year.
By April, the Center for Public Integrity found more than 30 percent of Americans had witnessed anti-Asian
discrimination.
A year later, Chinatown is a ghost of its former self. We used to feel like strangers who somehow belonged to
one another in the most minimally neighborly way. Now it all just feels strange.
The sidewalks no longer come alive with people. The sounds of Bostonians too busy to be quiet are mute. Eye
contact is rare.
Donald Trump used his power as president to paint the virus as China's fault. He empowered folk to act on their
hate. He openly bullied CBS News correspondent Weijia Jiang. Much like we saw a rise in Muslim hate after
9/11, with COVID-19 came a cultural complicity in anti-Asian violence.
Over the last year, Stop AAPI Hate, a national coalition that has documented incidents of anti-Asian
discrimination during the pandemic, has received nearly 3,000 accounts of anti-Asian assaults. Sixty-seven of
those incidents were reported in Massachusetts.
While this wave of hate may be pandemic-driven, anti-Asian attitudes have always existed in America.
Michael Tom was in second grade, waiting to swing into playground joy, when he heard kids laughing. They
pulled their eyes back. And said, “Ching-chong.”
Growing up in a mostly white suburb in Pennsylvania, it wasn't until 2010 as a Boston University student, that
he felt community. Exploring Chinatown and Quincy, breathing in the cultural celebration, gave him a sense of
pride.
“To be Asian American is to be stuck in between,” said Tom, 28, a Somerville public relations associate. “I often
feel like I am not American enough to be American. People readily assume I don't speak English. I was an Eagle
Scout whose grandfather fought in the Korean War for the United States.”
He's cautious about leaving the house. Early on in the pandemic, his brother was spat on while running in Philly.
For him, whether we are talking about the Hell's Canyon Massacre of 1887, the vicious murder of Vincent Chin
in 1982, or the recent violent attacks against Asians in America, it's related.
“White supremacy bears down on all of us,” Tom said. “America has a pattern of using Asian Americans as
pawns. Historically, you can see it with the Immigration Act and then post-World War II, you see it with the
myth of the model minority and the way it's used to pit Asian Americans against Black Americans and Latinx
Americans. Who benefits? Who is pulling the strings behind us?”
America has always used citizenship, discrimination, and division to preserve whiteness.
During the era of World War II and the internment of Japanese Americans, everyone from Dr. Seuss to Life
magazine pushed anti-Japanese propaganda. Over time the hate was baked into American culture, and it
showed up in Boston, too.
In 1987, the Asian American Resource Workshop wrote a report, “To Live in Peace ... Responding to Anti-Asian
Violence in Boston.” The report cites incidents like the case of Chinese immigrant Long Guang Huang, who was
brutally beaten by a police officer in Chinatown in May 1985.
About seven years later, when Kibbee Miller was born, her parents knew they had to prepare her for a world that
would look at her differently.
Growing up in Mattapan, she was not yet 10 by the time classmates asked if her mom packed cat or dog in her
lunchbox. Around that same time, she was called the N-word for the first time.
A Black woman who is also Chinese, Miller said stereotypes about Asians make people think they can get away
with hate and violence. And anti-Blackness in America affects everything.
Not every assault on Asian Americans, Black folk, and marginalized communities is by a white person. White
supremacy birthed this divisive and violent behavior. A side effect is that prejudice affects how people of color
see each other and mistreat each other, too.
“There's this idea of Asians being submissive, quiet, and nonthreatening. At the same time the model minority
myth aligns Asians with whiteness. It's fragmenting us. We are all fighting systemic racism. But to tear down
these barriers we have to also talk about anti-Blackness in the Asian community.”
For Miller, these are her identities. And she had to fight both anti-Blackness and anti-Asian attitudes to embrace
herself. To her, the cultures overlap, from the way they center family to how they cherish their elders to the
importance of family dinners. And both cultures are experiencing racial trauma.
“Colonialism is so indoctrinated in America,” said Miller, 29, a Boston digital marketer. “We have to come
together.”
But what will that take? Carolyn Su thinks we need to be able to lay all the messy, complicated, and painful
truths bare. To understand accountability is not a punishment but a way forward.
When Su moved to Arlington from Texas in 2013, she noticed how teachers were confusing her daughter, a
preschooler then, with the other Asian student in her class. It was her own history repeating itself.
“I was very much ashamed of being Taiwanese American because that is what I was taught by all of the
implicit messages growing up. Do I want my daughter to feel that same sense of self-loathing, fear, and
shame? Or do I want her to feel proud of all that she is?”
Su had to put in self-work to gain confidence and examine how her insecurity around her identity stemmed
from how Asian Americans are deemed outsiders. The recent rise in violence against Asian Americans, has
been a reminder of the source of that fear.
“It's brought to light how Asian Americans can be so easily demonized as the perpetual foreigners,” said Su,
37, founder of Diverse We Run, celebrating athletic inclusion.
“We can be so quickly blamed as having been the cause of this pandemic and therefore any anger can be
directed toward Asians and justified. For so many Asians, it's representative of our experience, like the pain
and hurt that we feel doesn't matter,” she added.
Su doesn't know where to start, but she knows acknowledgement is necessary.
“There's no fixing it if we don't agree on there even being a problem to be fixed,” she said. “I don't know. It
always feels like the people of color who are affected by white supremacy are tasked with solving it.”
Mayoral candidate Michelle Wu believes we have to start with partnership, community, and policy.
“It's not enough to say we are having a conversation about Asian American issues and check the boxes. It's
not enough to do that with any identity,” the city councilor said. “Just as important are policy changes. We
need to make sure there are processes and everyone needs to have a voice in shaping the future.”
Like Miller and Tom, Wu's first experiences with racism date back to being teased over her seaweed snacks
and having her language mocked as a young girl in Illinois. She would see the bias again, even more
painfully, in how her mother was treated by the mental health care system.
“What I have known my whole life and what I have found in shared connection with far too many Asian
American friends is a feeling of invisibility,” Wu said.
It wasn't until she was a student at Harvard, volunteering in Chinatown at the Asian American Civic
Association, that she felt truly connected to the pieces of her identity she had to code-switch growing up. We
can't let that happen to the next generation.
“There's over 110 different languages spoken in BPS,” Wu said. “The breadth and beauty here, the diversity of
race, ethnicity, background, lived experiences — for me it is most important to create the spaces and
community for people to bring their full multidimensional selves into the conversation.”
In February 2020, as Chinatown was being crushed by xenophobia, Wu co-hosted a dim sum brunch at China
Pearl to combat the stigma. Since then, she has been in conversation with people all over the country
about not just anti-Asian discrimination, but racism. The violence against Asian Americans is a reminder of
hate crimes across communities of color.
“The model minority myth has pitted us against other communities in a generational fight for equity and
justice. Our communities have been closely intertwined. Many of the Asian American immigrants benefitted
from the Civil Rights activists and leaders who fought for justice and kept the door open for everyone else,”
Wu said.
“The partnerships for communities of color standing side by side through the decades — we need to be
building that infrastructure for communities to connect and stand shoulder to shoulder to end racism
against all communities who have been otherized in our system, period.”
We cannot continue to treat the fight against supremacy as a segregated fight. The cost of division has
been our freedoms. Collective liberation requires a collective revolution.",9036
"For Asian Americans, attacks hit home: Struggling with rise in racism, women see Ga. rampage as confirmation of worst fears ","Pan, Deanna",Boston Globe,2021-03-18,"When she first read the headlines from Georgia, Danielle Kim knew in her bones what horror had come to pass. 
A series of shootings at three spas in Atlanta and a nearby suburb had left eight people dead, including six Asian women. At least four of the six women were of Korean descent, like Kim. 
“It was clear to me this was not just a random attack on just regular small businesses,"" Kim said. “It appeared, based on what we're seeing, that this likely may have been a lot more targeted toward the Asian community and specifically, Asian women."" 
The suspect in custody — a 21-year-old white man named Robert Aaron Long — claimed he was not motivated by racism. But to many Asian Americans, Tuesday's deadly rampage felt like the culmination of a year in which anti-Asian racism has soared. 
In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Asian Americans have been insulted, harassed, spat upon, shunned, beaten, and killed. The organization Stop AAPI Hate has recorded nearly 3,800 anti-Asian hate incidents nationwide since last March, when the group first started tracking the attacks. More than two-thirds of the victims, the group noted, were women. 
Law enforcement officials have said that Long claimed he was motivated by “sexual addiction,"" but investigators are not ruling out the role anti-Asian bias might have played. Long has been charged with eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault. 
Four of the victims who were killed have been identified: Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Xiaojie Tan, 49; and Daoyou Feng, 44. 
Regardless of the motive, the slayings have rattled many Asian Americans, still reeling from the recent and highly publicized assaults on Asian elders in California and New York. On Jan. 28, an 84-year-old Thai man named Vicha Ratanapakdee was brutally beaten during his morning walk in San Francisco. He died of his injuries days later. 
Earlier this month, an 83-year-old Korean women in White Plains, N.Y., was struck so hard she blacked out. 
As she processed the news, Kim thought of her Korean parents, small-business owners in New Jersey, and her near constant worry for their safety. And she was reminded of an incident last March, at the beginning of the pandemic, when a middle-aged white woman snarled at her to “go back to where [she] came from"" as they passed each other in the Seaport. 
“That comment sat with me for days and weeks to come,"" said Kim, secretary of the Massachusetts Asian American Commission. “Every once in a while, I'll think back to that moment."" 
This past year of sickness, isolation, and death has been emotionally and psychologically taxing for nearly everyone, but for Asian Americans, grief and anxiety have been compounded by anti-Asian sentiment fueled by the pandemic. Civil rights groups have accused former president Donald Trump of stoking the flames of hate when he referred to the coronavirus as the “China virus"" or “Kung flu."" But the history of anti-Asian racism is much longer. 
Historian Ellen Wu, director of the Asian American Studies Program at Indiana University, said Tuesday's killings stem from a wretched tradition of discrimination against Asian women, who are stereotyped not only as passive and submissive, but as hypersexual and exotic. 
The fetishization of Asian women began with the Page Law of 1875, the first federal statute to restrict immigration to the United States. The law was ostensibly aimed at preventing Chinese prostitutes from entering the country, but in practice, it excluded virtually all Chinese women, Wu said. During and after the Korean
War, American soldiers regularly frequented Asian sex workers — women, Wu notes, who “didn't have a lot of options"" in countries devastated by war. 
From “Madame Butterfly"" to “Sayonara,"" theimage of the feminine, sexual, and subservient Asian woman has been recycled generation after generation in popular culture, Wu said, and consequently, has become “embedded in our collective cultural imagination."" And so for many Asian American women, it's impossible to separate the Georgia shooter's apparent misogyny from the specter of racism. 
“There is often a lot of unchecked, invisible violence that exists for Asian women, whether it's because of their race, or because of their immigration status, or the type of industry they're in,"" said Lisette Le, executive director of VietAID, a Fields Corner nonprofit that primarily serves Vietnamese nail salon workers. 
“They can be seen as disposable."" 
Boston City Councilor and mayoral candidate Michelle Wu, a daughter of Taiwanese immigrants, recounted in a statement her own experiences with anti-Asian racism following Tuesday's attacks. 
“Some of my most vivid childhood memories involve racist encounters with strangers,"" she wrote. “People who knew nothing about me except for my appearance feeling empowered to pull eyes into slits, or to chant ching chong sounds."" 
She also described “that constant feeling of needing to be aware, ready, on guard whenever out in public."" 
Asian Americans represent about 7 percent of the population in Massachusetts. In the United States, Asians make up about 6 percent of the population, up from about 2 percent in 1980, William Frey, chief demographer at the Brookings Institution, told The New York Times. 
Feelings like those experienced by Wu are not uncommon among Asian American women. A 27-year-old Southeast Asian woman who spoke to the Globe recalled how a stranger pulled a fake gun on her while she was walking to work in Dorchester last May. The woman, who asked to remain anonymous so her family wouldn't worry, said a man was approaching her from the opposite direction when he aimed a bright green firearm at her. He pulled the trigger and the gun clicked. 
“I flinched,"" she said, “and then he kept walking."" 
She had always felt safe walking to work, but that moment changed everything. She felt conflicted about calling the police because she was worried about how their presence would affect Black residents in the neighborhood. But her co-workers urged her to report the incident. 
Between sobs, she tried explaining the incident to police, but the operator on the other end “was confused why I was calling,"" she said. 
“They didn't understand."" She was transferred to 911 and again, she was questioned why she was even calling when “this is not an emergency."" “They kept transferring me here and there,"" the woman said. 
Then the call dropped. 
The only official record of what happened to her is a complaint she filed online with the civil rights division of the state attorney general's office. But “there was no follow-up,"" the woman said. 
She doesn't own a car, so she still walks to work. But now, she spends more money on rideshares and avoids public transportation because she fears being attacked on a train or bus. 
She tries to hide her Asian features. 
“I wear sunglasses, I wear caps, I wear hoods,"" she said. “I wear sneakers in case I need to run.""

Fear and hate in Atlanta,Board,Boston Globe,2021-03-17,"Guns and hate. Hate and guns. It's the same story over and over again in the United States. Only the details of
the particular weapon, and the particular bigotry consuming the killer, seem to change.
On Tuesday, a man opened fire at three spas in the Atlanta area, killing eight. Six of the victims were women of
Asian descent.
The police said the alleged shooter was a 21-year-old sex addict who may have patronized the spas in the past
and wanted to eliminate them because they were a source of temptation.
He was caught as he headed to Florida, where he may have planned to target “some type of porn industry,”
according to Sheriff Frank Reynolds of Cherokee County, Ga.
To the Asian American community, which has suffered from a series of high-profile attacks, the fact that the
shooter may not necessarily have been specifically motivated by anti-Asian hate comes as no relief. Considering
the long history in this country of anti-Asian violence, recent efforts by former president Donald Trump to blame
the COVID-19 pandemic on China, and the spate of depraved assaults on Asian Americans that have been
caught on video recently, there's a good reason why so many Asian Americans are on edge.
The killings take place “in a landscape where Asian Americans are increasingly terrified and fearful for their lives
and their safety because of these escalating threats against our people,” said Michelle Au, a Georgia state
senator who represents an Atlanta-area district.
If it turns out the shooter really did target his victims for sexual reasons, he won't be the first. America has
another violent strain — of sexually frustrated or confused men targeting women, which has surfaced most
recently in “incel” violence.
Hate-fueled killers in the United States have also targeted Black people, gay people, Jewish people, Sikhs . . .
the list goes on.
The first step to stopping the hatreds that underlie the violence is for leaders to denounce it unequivocally. Over
the last year, too many Republicans stayed silent as Trump, in an effort to deflect blame for his mishandling of
the coronavirus pandemic, tried to shift blame to China. It did not take any kind of crystal ball to see how that
kind of rhetoric would translate into fear and suspicion of Chinese Americans and other people of Asian descent.
More broadly, any political strategy that relies on stoking white, male, or white-male grievance is part of the
problem, because pandering to those attitudes only gives them oxygen.
That responsibility extends beyond elected officials. Especially among conservative evangelical groups, there
was also a general failure during the Trump years to stand up against hate against immigrants, Muslims, and
other groups targeted by the former president. For that matter, religious organizations and leaders should
reconsider how they portray women — and foremost the idea that they are to blame for tempting men.
Law enforcement should also do a better job identifying, tracking, and prosecuting hate crimes; it's nearly
impossible to get reliable data on the extent of racially motivated violence. The adage is true: You can't manage
what you don't measure, and law enforcement has been blind to the extent of white supremacist and other hate
activity.
Finally, at long last, state governments and Congress need to get real about guns.
The fact that a troubled 21-year-old apparently had no trouble getting a gun is utterly insane. The plain fact is
that too many people in this country have too much access to too many deadly weapons. Even minor reforms,
like outlawing sales at gun shows without background checks, have been stymied by the gun lobby.
The problem posed by guns and the gun culture in America goes beyond the carnage caused by the gunsthemselves. A country that's awash with firearms, and inducements to buy more and more of them for “self-
defense” is one in which there's profit to be had in stoking fear and division. It's no accident that the NRA, whichis ostensibly just a gun-rights group, has been scaremongering about the Black Lives Matter movement; getting
Americans to fear and hate each other is a great strategy to sell them more guns.
There's no single solution to prevent the next shooting. But as social problems, guns and hate are joined at the
hip.
Putting an end to anti-Asian hate — and all the other social pathologies that define too much of American life —
will take time and effort. In the short term, that means forcefully defending Asian Americans from defamation
around the coronavirus, and showing zero tolerance for hatemongering. Longer term, getting guns out of
Americans' hands and getting hate out of their hearts will both point us to a more peaceful future.",4711
Call the Atlanta killings what they are: racial terrorism ,None,Boston Globe,2021-03-17,"Robert Aaron Long is a terrorist. 
He told police he went on a killing spree, murdering eight people, most of them women of Asian descent, because of his sex addiction. The Asian massage spas he targeted, officials said, were “a temptation that he wanted to eliminate.” 
He's been charged with murder and assault. It doesn't appear to be racially motivated, some officials say. Some believe it's too early in the investigation to call it a hate crime. Even the president and vice president are shying away from motives. 
Domestic terrorism, as described by the FBI, is violent, criminal acts committed to further ideological goals. This can stem from political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature. 
Long prioritized his sexual morality over human life. He fetishized Asian women. He apparently believed he had the right to kill whomever tempted him to stray from his faith. If this is not a hate crime, laws need to be rewritten. If we cannot see this mass shooting as terrorism, we need to redefine it. 
Stop calling him “the 21-year-old,” as if his youth is an excuse. Stop digging into how he was super nice, “nerdy,” and “big into religion.” Call Long a murderer, a terrorist, a sexist, and a racist. Care more about his victims, like Delaina Ashley Yaun and Xiaojie Yan. 
They were alive. They had dreams. They were loved by somebody who is missing them today. 
And yet, Georgia officials seem to want to soften their killer. 
“He was pretty much fed up, at the end of his rope and this was a very bad day for him and this is what he did,” said a Cherokee County Sheriff's Office spokesman, Captain Jay Baker. 
A very bad day? The sympathy for the devil is real. 
Over five years ago, when Dylann Roof murdered nine worshipers at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., folk were hesitant to call him a terrorist. 
Back then, I wrote, “I guess people shy away from calling acts like this terrorism because that would mean white supremacy in itself is a terrorist act. And we live in a country that operates on systemic racism.” 
This is still true. And like all forms of racism against nonwhite people, America likes to erase the reality. Pretend progress is easier than actually taking into account the violence supremacy inflicts. 
And when the victims are women, well, it's been a year since police killed Breonna Taylor in Louisville and there is no justice to be had. America, like the rest of the world, devalues girls and women — especially girls and women of color. 
Women of Asian descent are no exception. Almost a quarter of Asian American and Pacific Islander women in America have experienced some form of sexual violence in their lives, according to a CDC 2010-2012 report on intimate partner and sexual violence. 
Long was specific in the kind of temptation he targeted for destruction: Asian spas. 
The hypersexualization of Asian women in Hollywood, pornography, and historic novels, combined with the stereotype of submissiveness, contribute to the fetishization that leads to sexual violence and trafficking of women and girls of Asian descent. These tropes and violence date back to World War II, the Korean War, Vietnam War, and places of US military occupation, like South Korea. 
Add this violent, sexual bias to the past year of anti-Asian assaults stirred up by Donald Trump empowering xenophobic, racist ideals around COVID-19, and the truth is undeniable. It's imperative we call racism exactly what it is: racism. 
Over the last year, Stop AAPI Hate, a national coalition that has documented incidents of anti-Asian 
discrimination during the pandemic, has received nearly 3,800 accounts of anti-Asian assaults from March 19, 2020 to Feb. 28, 2021. 
Last week, President Biden condemned the hate against Asian Americans as he addressed the nation on the one-year anniversary of the pandemic. 
“Too often, we have turned against one another,” Biden said. “A mask, the easiest thing to do to save lives, sometimes, it divides us, states pitted against one another, instead of working with each other, vicious hate crimes against Asian Americans, who have been attacked, harassed, blamed, and scapegoated.” 
“At this very moment, so many of them, our fellow Americans, they're on the front lines of this pandemic trying to save lives, and still, still they're forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in America. It's wrong. It's un-American. And it must stop,” he added. 
But how, when legislation and law enforcement rarely work in our favor? 
Prayers and condolences won't end it. Neither will shying away from firmly defining something as racist. As a Black woman, I know things can be sexist and racist at the same time. In fact, they often are — each are core values of white supremacy. 
Long's accused crimes may not be related to coronavirus, but they are most certainly anti-Asian and anti women. This is not by coincidence. 
We can't afford to have media who want to know more about the killer's life than they do the victims who are no longer here. We cannot keep paying police to safely arrest a man after a killing tour of Asian spas and dismiss it as a young man with a sex addiction while George Floyd's character is on trial as a victim of a police lynching. 
Until we start recognizing racial terror as terrorism, the very bad days won't end for Black people and people of color in America. We're playing a game of Groundhog Day with white supremacy — and it's killing us. ",5497
Rally along marathon route denounces anti-Asian hate,"Crimaldi, Laura; Sasani, Ava",Boston Globe,2021-03-27,"As Haihong Li biked last fall on a trail near the New Hampshire border, another cyclist shouted at her from behind: “Move out!”
She said she quickly realized those words had nothing to do with making room on the trail and everything to do with the way she looks.
“I was furious,” Li said Saturday.
Li, who is the principal at the Wellesley Chinese Language School, told the story to runners and supporters near the starting line of the historic Boston Marathon in Hopkinton for a rally and run to denounce the violence and discrimination against Asian people that has been surging since the coronavirus pandemic began.
Organizers dispatched relay runners in the eight communities on the 26.2-mile course between Hopkinton and Boston to spread their message, and concluded the event with a rally on Boston Common.
The fight against anti-Asian racism intensified after a gunman killed eight people at Atlanta-area spas on March 16, including six women of Asian descent. Investigators have said the suspect, Robert Aaron Long, who is white, confessed to the killings.
He claimed to have a sex addiction, authorities said, and targeted what he saw as sources of temptation. The police account of Long's claims generated backlash, though investigators have said they're still working to establish a motive, including looking into whether or not the attacks can be classified as hate crimes.
A sheriff's deputy for the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office in Georgia drew criticism for saying Long had “a really bad day” and “this is what he did.”
On Boston Common, the crowd booed when Newton School Committee member Anping Shen recalled the deputy's remarks.
Shen said Asian immigrants in the United States have a long history of working under perilous conditions, including Chinese laborers who died by the hundreds while building the transcontinental railroad during the 19th century.
“They thought, Chinese people built the Great Wall, let's bring some Chinese laborers to do the job. And millions of Chinese laborers came here,” said Shen. “They worked damn hard. They worked in the most dangerous places.”
In Hopkinton, demonstrators held a moment of silence in honor of the Atlanta-area victims. Violinist Pamela Fengperformed “Méditation” from the opera “Thaïs” by composer Jules Massenet.
“I and every other Asian American, and person of color have faced racism for just being different, and this is costing us our lives,” said Xiaofan Zhang, an organizer who lives in Boston's West End neighborhood.
The national coalition Stop AAPI Hate received 96 reports from Massachusetts of anti-Asian hate and discrimination between March 19, 2020 and Feb. 28, according to data released earlier this month. Nationwide, the group received 3,795 reports of anti-Asian incidents during the same period, it said.
Many blame the latest wave of anti-Asian bias on Donald Trump, and the xenophobic rhetoric he used to link COVID-19 to China.
Locally, there have been a series of events to show support for the Asian community, including a rally earlier this month on Boston Common, a virtual town hall held Thursday about anti-Asian racism, and vigils in Lowell and Brookline honoring the victims of the Atlanta-area attacks. Similar demonstrations have been held nationally, including a large rally Saturday in Los Angeles.
On Saturday, the storied marathon route provided a powerful backdrop for the demonstrators' mission, evoking the long history of racism that Asians have experienced in the United States and the resilient campaign against it.
Jing Zhang, who spoke in Hopkinton on behalf of the BEN Running Club, explained the meaning of the Chinese characters in the organization's logo.
Its three stacked oxen, she said, symbolize “strength and unity.”
“We may not be able to sprint in record speed, but we can really run long. We can endure,” Zhang said.
She encouraged demonstrators to look at the event as the beginning of a “long race against hate, biases, discrimination, and violence against humanity.”
“Together, we can do this. We can walk. We can run. And we can lead,” Zhang said. “While we're doing this, we spread hope, love, unity, and strength.”
Thomas Grilk, chief executive of the Boston Athletic Association, the organizer of the Boston Marathon, wore a shirt from a 2019 marathon in Lanzhou, China, and told the gathering in Hopkinton that he spent several years living in Asia.
“We at the Boston Athletic Association are humbled. We are honored that you choose this place and this course to come together against hatred and in favor of respect among peoples everywhere,” said Grilk.
The runners, some of whom carried American flags, departed from the Hopkinton Town Common before 11 a.m. followed by a group of motorcyclists who were supporting them. Many of the runners and spectators wore a sticker showing a running figure with a peace sign T-shirt, the hashtag #StopAsianHate, and the words, “unity, equality, diversity.”
On Boston Common, Representative Jake Auchincloss, a Democrat from Newton, addressed the rally.
“We must all resolve, and I resolve, to do better about speaking out, when you hear words of hatred, whether they come from the chief executive, or whether they come from around your own kitchen table,” he said.
Midway through the rally, a group of organizers shouted, “Stop being quiet!”
Demonstrators responded, “No more!”
Eileen Zhang, 42, of Quincy, brought her children and cousins to the Boston Common rally.
“We are one America, we are not foreigners, so we want to make sure our voices are heard,” she said.",5550
'She did everything for me': What we know so far about the people killed in the shootings at Atlanta-area spas,"Kaufman, Amanda; Bowker, Brittany",Boston Globe,2021-03-19,"Authorities have identified the victims who were killed after a gunman opened fire Tuesday night at three Atlanta-area spas.
Six of the eight who were killed were of Asian descent, and seven of the victims were women. The attack stirred fear among Asian-American communities, which have seen increasing racist abuse since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In a statement dated Thursday, the Fulton County medical examiner's office released the names of the four women killed at the Gold Spa and Aromatherapy Spa in the city's Piedmont Heights neighborhood. Atlanta authorities released the names of four of the victims killed at Young's Asian Massage spa in Cherokee County earlier in the week.
The names of the eight people who died, as released by authorities, are Daoyou Feng, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Tan, Delaina Ashley Yaun, Hyun J. Grant, Soon C. Park, Suncha Kim, and Yong A. Yue.
Here's what we know so far about them.
Daoyou Feng, 44
Feng was a recently hired employee at Young's Asian Massage. An editor at the World Journal, a Chinese-language news site with offices in Atlanta, told the Washington Post that its reporters had not been able to ascertain anything yet about Feng — not even the proper Chinese characters for her name. The editor said it is still unclear whether she had ties to China, Taiwan, or another country.
Paul Andre Michels, 54, of Tucker, Ga.
Michels was a businessman and a veteran of the US Army infantry, where he served in the late 1980s, according to his brother. His brother said Michels was doing work for the spa and “might have been talking with the spa's owner about how the business operates” because he was thinking of opening a spa himself. Michels was one of nine siblings. He had been married for more than 20 years and was a Catholic, and was a strong political conservative. He grew up in southwest Detroit and moved to Georgia 25 years ago for work, his brother told the New York Times. Michels was one of the four victims shot at Young's Asian Massage.
Xiaojie Tan, 49, of Kennesaw, Ga.
Tan was the owner of Young's Asian Massage. She would have turned 50 on Thursday. Tan, or Emily as she was known by friends, was dedicated to her job and her daughter, a recent University of Georgia graduate, a friend and customer told the Washington Post. Tan's family is from China, and she sometimes hosted Lunar New Year and Fourth of July parties with food and fireworks at her spa.
“She was a very good friend, a kind, sweet person,” Greg Hynson told the paper.
Tan's 29-year-old daughter, Jami Webb, told USA Today Tan worked “every day, 12 hours a day, so that me and our family would have a better life.”
“She did everything for me and for the family,” Webb said. “She provided everything.”
Michael Webb met Tan while traveling for work in China in the early 2000s, according to USA Today, and they got married in 2004. He legally adopted Jami in 2006 before the family moved from Florida to Georgia, where Tan opened her first business, a nail salon.
She and Michael remained friends after they split up in 2012. Michael, a contractor, helped Tan remodel Young's Asian Massage, her second business, last year while it was closed due to COVID-19.
“She'd always say, 'we family,'” Michael told USA Today. “Even when we got divorced, she'd say that: 'We family.' Because that's how she was.”
Jami and Michael spent Tan's 50th birthday planning her funeral.
Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33, of Acworth, Ga.
Yaun, 33, was visiting Young's Asian Massage spa for the first time with her husband on the night of the shooting. They booked a couples massage and were in separate rooms when the gunman entered and started shooting, according to a relative. Yaun's husband survived, and was locked in a nearby room as gunshots rang out. Yaun was one of four siblings who grew up in the area, and had worked as a server at a Waffle House restaurant. She raised a 13-year-old son as a single mother and had an 8-month-old daughter over the summer with her husband. She was close with her family and her mother lived with her as well.
Hyun Jung Grant, 51
Grant's son, Randy Park, told The Daily Beast in an interview that Grant “was a single mother of two kids who dedicated her whole life to raising them.”
He said he got a call Tuesday evening from the daughter of a survivor who had been next to Grant when the shooting happened.
Park spoke about the need to take care of his little brother in the wake of his mom's death.
“You see this stuff in TV shows and movies,” Park said. “It's surreal. But I have a younger brother that I have to take care of now, so as much as I want to be sad and grieve — and I am super sad — I have no choice but to move on. To figure out the whole living situation for probably the next year with my brother.”
Park said Grant wasn't just his mother but also his friend who he could tell anything to.
Grant loved to go “dancing and partying,” Park said. They would go out for sushi every night before she left for work.
In a GoFundMe page started by Park, he said he and his brother don't have other family members in the country.
“The rest of my family is in South Korea and are unable to come,” he wrote. “She was one of my best friends and the strongest influence on who we are today. Losing her has put a new lens on my eyes on the amount of hate that exists in our world.”
“My biggest priority right now is to put my mother to rest and plan out the funeral but due to some legal complications, I am unable to obtain my mother's body,” he wrote. “I don't think I'll be able to figure out this whole situation along with legal matters if given 2 weeks to move out.”
As of early Friday afternoon, the GoFundMe has raised more than $900,000 of its initial $20,000 goal.

"Asian Americans, many for the first time, are giving children and elderly parents 'The Talk' on how to protect themselves from hate","Leung, Shirley",Boston Globe,2021-03-27,"Black parents have long had “The Talk” with their children on how they should behave when pulled over by the police: Hands out of your pockets, do what they say, no sudden moves. Now many Asian Americans, for the first time, are having similar conversations with their children on how to gird themselves against a wave of anti-Asian sentiment, violence, and bullying.
For Mai Du and her 17-year-old son, Thomas Tran, talking about Asian hate may not be new, but playing out the what-if scenarios is.
Over dinner recently, Du asked her son what would he do if someone was being harassed on the T. Would he confront the perpetrator? Would he look the other way? After some reflection, the Dorchester mother and son, who are Chinese-Vietnamese, came up with what they believe is the best course of action: Pull out your phone and take video.
“That,” Du said, “is the first line of self-defense.”
Some parents have been putting off these uncomfortable discussions, but they're now unavoidable after the targeted murders of six Asian-American women in the Atlanta area. One Korean-American mom's TikTok video — complete with flash cards “stop,” “Asian,” “hate” — has gone viral.
Before Atlanta, “it wasn't in my sphere of thinking,” said Jenny Lee, a Korean-American whose daughter is 5 and son is 7. “It's hard to talk about murder, especially with a 5-year-old. They can't even imagine. Why would anyone hurt someone else because of the color of their skin or their heritage?”
To open the door for conversation, Lee drove her kids by a recent rally for Asian Americans in Wellesley, where they live. Then at bedtime, Lee explained a little more about what's happening in the world.
“We talk about why equality is so important and how the color of your skin shouldn't matter, but not everyone thinks that way,” said Lee, a medical devices executive.
It's a conversation her parents did not have with her. Growing up in Florida, she was 10 years old when she realized she was different after a boy on her school bus yelled: “Ching-chong, you don't have any eyelashes!”
Lee was shell-shocked. She felt less than. And, she doesn't want her children to go through the same rude awakening. “I want to be able to have that conversation first and see what is on their mind,” she said.
Generations of Asian Americans have been raised to work hard, get an education, and quietly assimilate. That is how my parents, immigrants originally from China, brought me up: Keep your head down because no matter what you'll always be treated like an outsider. Our silence, for the most part, has been golden — until now.
The Atlanta-area mass shooting at three spas by a white gunman has become our day of reckoning. The deaths of Daoyou Feng, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, Soon Chung Park, Xiaojie Tan, and Yong Ae Yue could have been any one of our grandmothers, mothers, sisters, daughters, or aunties.
Let there be no doubt that Donald Trump's xenophobic rhetoric, calling COVID-19 the “Chinese virus” and “kung flu,” has made this country unsafe for Asian Americans.
In just one period in March 2020, researchers found about half of the nearly 800,000 tweets featuring #chinesevirus also included anti-Asian hashtags, many with violent implications. In the one year since, there have been nearly 3,800 incidents of Asian hate nationwide documented by the coalition Stop AAPI Hate, which believes the true scope is significantly under-reported.
Trump may be out of the White House, but his legacy of hate remains. It now threatens the most vulnerable members of the Asian-American community, not only women but seniors who have been targeted in a spate of attacks coast to coast, including one that left an 84-year-old Thai man in the San Francisco Bay Area dead in January.
That means for some Asian Americans, “The Talk” has gone intergenerational. As Du counsels her teenager on how to deal with hate, she also has to warn her 82-year-old mother, who lives in Malden, not to go grocery shopping alone.
“She has to be escorted at all times,” said Du, who owns and runs two martial arts academies.
Along with worry, the pervading feeling among Asian-American parents is anger that another generation born in the United States is being treated like perpetual foreigners. (Note to the rest of America: Chinese immigrants began arriving nearly two centuries ago as laborers to mine gold and build railroads. Today, Asian Americans are the fastest-growing community of color in Greater Boston and in the country.)
Consider Hanh Tran, born in Boston, her mother one of the boat people who fled Vietnam after the war. Tran, who grew up in Dorchester and is not related to Thomas Tran, has tolerated racist taunts throughout her life, hurled at the most mundane moments, such as one at a gas station where a white man told her: “Gook, go back to where you come from.”
But as any parent can attest, it's different when your child experiences that pain of living in an ugly world. After the Atlanta murders, her 12-year-old son, Kenneth, who dealt with bullying at a previous school, felt unsafe. “I didn't want to go outside without a grown-up,” he said.
After Atlanta, Hanh Tran gives voices to what so many Asian Americans are thinking: “Are you serious? I thought it would change. It did not change at all.”
“I tell my family in Vietnam: You come to America. You think it's peaceful. You're living the life. It's really not,” said Tran, who lost her airline job during the pandemic and now is going back to school. “It's too good to be true.”
For Christine Koh, a Korean American and coauthor of Minimalist Parenting, the topic of inclusivity — whether race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion — has always been part of her conversations with her daughters, 10 and 16.
But the tone and focus began to change after Trump's election in 2016 and in the early days of the pandemic, when Koh herself could feel growing anti-Asian hostility in society. A year ago, before masks were mandatory, she felt self-conscious wearing a face covering fearing it would highlight her Asian-ness. In Asia, mask wearing has been widely accepted as a way to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.
Koh, who lives in the Boston area, began to speak more directly about Asian racism with her daughters, especially her teenager, who has a cellphone and is plugged into the news. Koh's message is simple: If someone says something mean, don't suffer in silence, and always know Mom and Dad are here to support you.
“There is a shame piece that is deeply rooted that keeps people quiet,” said Koh. “You think it's your fault.”
Koh and her family experienced countless acts of racism in Belmont, where she grew up from the 1970s to 1990s, and in Jamaica Plain where her parents owned a convenience store. Koh recalls one incident around age 7 in Belmont, when she was out walking with her mother and felt the pelt of a hard object and a spray of cold liquid, followed by an epithet (”Take that chinks!”) coming from a group of teenagers in a moving car. She had been hit by a can of soda.
Her second message to her daughters is to be aware of their surroundings. That means don't be glued to your cellphone when you leave the house. “Eyes up always,” Koh has been telling them. “You never want to get hit in the back of the head.”
Henry Wright, a sophomore at North Andover High School whose mother is Korean American and father is Caucasian, is one of those kids who has kept his reactions to the bullying bottled up. On Snapchat, the 15-year-old's so-called friends would tease him about how Asians eat dogs and cats. In the hallways at school, students get in his face and hold up a yellow highlighter or a lemon, teasing: “What's the difference?”
Wright is not sure what to do. It's a common struggle: Do you respond and risk escalating the situation? His mother, Anna Choi, has been telling her son to ignore those kids. “You have to feel sorry for them,” said Choi, a professor at Endicott College.
In his college-entrance essay, Thomas Tran wrote about an experience last August: He witnessed a group of white boys biking past two elderly Asian-American neighbors, screaming: “Go back to your [expletive] country!”
Tran, who lives in Dorchester and is a senior at Boston Latin, reacted like so many of us would have: He froze. Not because Tran had never experienced racism himself, or that the incident was so shocking. In his essay, he concluded this: “I normalized racism in order to survive, and so have many others.”
He replays that day often in his mind. And now he understands that he can't let little acts of racism go because they add up, especially after the Atlanta killings.
“What if it was my aunt, mom, or grandma, and that happened to them?” Tran pondered.
The burden of “The Talk” has been placed on generations of Black families — and now Asian Americans.
For me, it's has been easier to talk about this with my 71-year-old widowed mother who lives in California. I tell her not to go out alone, and she already decided not to go into Chinatown in Oakland. I know my mom is serious when she says, in Mandarin, that she's “xia si le,” a colloquial expression that translates as “scared to death.”
It's harder to talk about this with my two sons, ages 8 and 10. Over the past week, I've toggled between anger at having to do this at all, and a longing to insulate them just a little bit longer from the real world.
It's particularly heart-rending when my younger son stops me at: “What is Asian?”
We parents of color will continue to deliver “The Talk” as long as hate remains a threat. But to prevent history from repeating itself, we can't be the only ones doing the talking.
To truly stop the vicious cycle of hate, white parents need to do their part and have the kind of uncomfortable conversations that can root out racism before it grows into violent acts of hate.",9852
Asian American women shaken by Atlanta-area killings,"Pan, Deanna ",Boston Globe,2021-03-18,"When she first read the headlines from Georgia, Danielle Kim knew in her bones what horror had come to pass. 
A series of shootings at three spas in Atlanta and a nearby suburb had left eight people dead, including six Asian women. At least four of the six women were of Korean descent, like Kim. 
“It was clear to me this was not just a random attack on just regular small businesses,” Kim said. “It appeared, based on what we're seeing, that this likely may have been a lot more targeted toward the Asian community and specifically, Asian women.” 
The suspect in custody — a 21-year-old white man named Robert Aaron Long — claimed he was not motivated by racism. But to many Asian Americans, Tuesday's deadly rampage felt like the culmination of a year in which anti-Asian racism has soared. 
In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Asian Americans have been insulted, harassed, spat upon, shunned, beaten, and killed. The organization Stop AAPI Hate has recorded nearly 3,800 anti-Asian hate incidents nationwide since last March, when the group first started tracking the attacks. More than two-thirds of the victims, the group noted, were women. 
Law enforcement officials have said that Long claimed he was motivated by “sexual addiction,” but investigators are not ruling out the role anti-Asian bias might have played. Long has been charged with eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault. 
Four of the victims who were killed have been identified: Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Xiaojie Tan, 49; and Daoyou Feng, 44. 
Regardless of the motive, the slayings have rattled many Asian Americans, still reeling from the recent and highly publicized assaults on Asian elders in California and New York. On Jan. 28, an 84-year-old Thai man named Vicha Ratanapakdee was brutally beaten during his morning walk in San Francisco. He died of his injuries days later. Earlier this month, an 83-year-old Korean women in White Plains, N.Y., was struck so hard she blacked out. 
As she processed the news, Kim thought of her Korean parents, small-business owners in New Jersey, and her near constant worry for their safety. And she was reminded of an incident last March, at the beginning of the pandemic, when a middle-aged white woman snarled at her to “go back to where [she] came from” as they passed each other in the Seaport. 
“That comment sat with me for days and weeks to come,” said Kim, secretary of the Massachusetts Asian American Commission. “Every once in a while, I'll think back to that moment.” 
This past year of sickness, isolation, and death has been emotionally and psychologically taxing for nearly everyone, but for Asian Americans, grief and anxiety have been compounded by anti-Asian sentiment fueled by the pandemic. Civil rights groups have accused former president Donald Trump of stoking the flames of hate when he referred to the coronavirus as the “China virus” or “Kung flu.” But the history of anti-Asian racism is much longer. 
Historian Ellen Wu, director of the Asian American Studies Program at Indiana University, said Tuesday's killings stem from a wretched tradition of discrimination against Asian women, who are stereotyped not only as passive and submissive, but as hypersexual and exotic. 
The fetishization of Asian women began with the Page Law of 1875, the first federal statute to restrict immigration to the United States. The law was ostensibly aimed at preventing Chinese prostitutes from entering the country, but in practice, it excluded virtually all Chinese women, Wu said. During and after the Korean War, American soldiers regularly frequented Asian sex workers — women, Wu notes, who “didn't have a lot of options” in countries devastated by war. 
From “Madame Butterfly” to “Sayonara,” the image of the feminine, sexual, and subservient Asian woman has been recycled generation after generation in popular culture, Wu said, and consequently, has become “embedded in our collective cultural imagination.” And so for many Asian American women, it's impossible to separate the Georgia shooter's apparent misogyny from the specter of racism. 
“There is often a lot of unchecked, invisible violence that exists for Asian women, whether it's because of their race, or because of their immigration status, or the type of industry they're in,” said Lisette Le, executive director of VietAID, a Fields Corner nonprofit that primarily serves Vietnamese nail salon workers. “They can be seen as disposable.” 
Boston City Councilor and mayoral candidate Michelle Wu, a daughter of Taiwanese immigrants, recounted in a statement her own experiences with anti-Asian racism following Tuesday's attacks. 
“Some of my most vivid childhood memories involve racist encounters with strangers,” she wrote. “People who knew nothing about me except for my appearance feeling empowered to pull eyes into slits, or to chant ching chong sounds.” 
She also described “that constant feeling of needing to be aware, ready, on guard whenever out in public.” 
Asian Americans represent about 7 percent of the population in Massachusetts. In the United States, Asians make up about 6 percent of the population, up from about 2 percent in 1980, William Frey, chief demographer 
at the Brookings Institution, told The New York Times. 
Feelings like those experienced by Wu are not uncommon among Asian American women. A 27-year-old Southeast Asian woman who spoke to the Globe recalled how a stranger pulled a fake gun on her while she was walking to work in Dorchester last May. The woman, who asked to remain anonymous so her family wouldn't worry, said a man was approaching her from the opposite direction when he aimed a bright green firearm at her. He pulled the trigger and the gun clicked. 
“I flinched,” she said, “and then he kept walking.” 
She had always felt safe walking to work, but that moment changed everything. She felt conflicted about calling the police because she was worried about how their presence would affect Black residents in the neighborhood. But her co-workers urged her to report the incident. 
Between sobs, she tried explaining the incident to police, but the operator on the other end “was confused why I was calling,” she said. “They didn't understand.” She was transferred to 911 and again, she was questioned why she was even calling when “this is not an emergency.” 
“They kept transferring me here and there,” the woman said. Then the call dropped. 
The only official record of what happened to her is a complaint she filed online with the civil rights division of the state attorney general's office. But “there was no follow-up,” the woman said. She doesn't own a car, so she still walks to work. But now, she spends more money on rideshares and avoids public transportation because she fears being attacked on a train or bus. 
She tries to hide her Asian features. 
“I wear sunglasses, I wear caps, I wear hoods,” she said. “I wear sneakers in case I need to run.”

"Elderly Asian Americans are living in fear as assaults, confrontations soar. A retiree worries: 'If people beat me, I can die right away' ","Leung, Shirley",Boston Globe,2021-04-17,"A few weeks ago, Y. W. Shen, a petite Chinese American woman in her 70s, was on her daily walk in Medford when out of nowhere she was shoved to the ground by a stranger who muttered, ""Chink bitch,"" before sprinting off. 
The incident took place in broad daylight near a busy playground, but no one offered to help her as she sat on the curb, clutching a tissue to her bleeding head, Shen said. Doctors at the emergency room later told her she likely suffered a concussion. 
Recalling the attack later, Shen said she felt like the 65-year-old Filipino woman in New York City whose brutal beating just one day before hers was caught on video as security guards in a nearby building watched and locked the doors. 
""People usually jump to help someone if they have fallen down,"" said Shen. ""It's as if we are not seen as really belonging to American society, so it feels OK to treat us differently."" 
Shen had a similar experience a year ago in March, at the beginning of the pandemic. She was crossing at an intersection when two white men in a SUV drove right up to her, spitting and screaming: ""Virus, bitch!"" 
That time, Shen managed to angrily yell back a profanity. 
As infuriating as the incident was, Shen said what made her even more mad was this: The racist assault took place in front of a bus stop in Medford where a dozen people were waiting. 
""Nobody did anything,"" Shen recalled. (To protect Shen's identity, the Globe is using her Chinese name.) 
Shen's experiences were never captured in police logs because she, like many Asian Americans, are reluctant to report a hate crime. For some, it is a language barrier, while others fear retaliation, or, as in the case of Shen, they simply don't trust law enforcement. 
For these reasons, the incidents that are reported plainly represent a fraction of the actual number. An organization called Stop AAPI Hate has tried to quantify the real number by collecting reports from the Asian American community, and identified 3,795 incidents across the country over roughly the first year of the pandemic. 
But here in Massachusetts, police departments in Lowell and Quincy, cities with sizable Asian American populations, say they do not have a single report of a hate crime against Asian Americans over the past year. Boston and other major cities, however, have seen a sharp rise in anti-Asian hate crime since 2019, even as the overall numbers of hate crimes have declined. 
Boston recorded 14 anti-Asian incidents - primarily verbal assaults in 2020, up from eight in 2019. Already in 2021, the city has eight reported cases, according to the Boston Police Department. That compares to 16 reports of hate crimes against Black people and one against a Hispanic person this year. 
Anti-Asian hate has been surging as some people, looking for a scapegoat or blinded by bigotry, blame COVID-19 on China. Elderly Asian Americans, in particular, feel under attack after a spate of incidents in New York and Califomia were caught on video and went viral. One 84-year-old Thai immigrant died in January after being barreled to the ground outside his San Francisco home. 
Local Asian American groups say they are unaware of similar assaults against seniors. But the March 16 mass shooting in the Atlanta area that killed eight-including six Asian American women is heightening fears of potential violence spreading here. 
― 
All of which raises the question: What kind of society are we when senior citizens are picked off for blood sport? For many Asian Americans, myself included, this crosses a line. We are a culture that fiercely values those of the older generation who made sacrifices to allow their children to have a better life in America. To attack them is to attack our very essence. To have to tell our parents and grandparents to watch their backs is heartbreaking. I am certain if white seniors had been the victims, this country would have declared a national emergency by now. 
How J.H. Tang, 72, lives her life is the new normal for many older Asian Americans. The South End resident avoids going out alone, and, when she steps outside, she takes a good look around. 
""I never really felt this kind of fear,"" Tang said in Cantonese, speaking through a translator. ""I feel like the Chinese are especially being targeted. We are treated like enemies, like we all have the virus."" 
Her son recently bought her pepper spray, but the grandmother of five wasn't sure what to do with it. 
""I am afraid of using it,"" Tang said. ""What if they have a weapon? I don't want to escalate the situation."" 
Vivian Tseng, a 69-year-old retired corporate lawyer in Concord, had a completely different response after the Atlanta murders: She decided to learn how to shoot a gun. Like many Asian Americans, Tseng has been feeling invisible and helpless after a year of growing anti-Asian sentiment. 
""It's driven by rage and a sense of aloneness,"" Tseng said. ""If I don't do something for myself, nobody is going to save me."" 
Long Nguyen, the father of state Representative Tram Nguyen, was an undercover police officer in Vietnam. But now, at age 67 and living in Methuen, he is scared to leave his house. In frail health, he knows he cannot defend himself. 
""If people beat me, I can die right away,"" said Nguyen. 
He tells his wife to come straight home from work and not run unnecessary errands. He also advises her to wear a mask and a hat. ""Don't let people recognize you as Vietnamese,” he said. 
When Nguyen learned about the beating of a 83-year-old Vietnamese immigrant in San Francisco that took place a day after the Atlanta shootings, he realized he knew the victim, Ngoc Pham, who was his supervisor on the police force in Vietnam. Nguyen still had Pham's number and reached out to check on him after an image of his badly bruised face was splayed over the Internet. 
Pham told him he is going be OK, but Nguyen remains shaken. ""Oh my God, maybe me later, next time,"" he said. 
President Biden, through an executive order in January, has taken aim at anti-Asian hate and has directed the Department of Justice to make it one of its highest priorities. Last fall the US attorney's office in Massachusetts created a civil rights task force, and much of its current focus is on preventing hate crimes against the Asian American community, according to a spokeswoman. 
Police departments in Boston and Lowell say that since the Atlanta killings, they have stepped up patrols, from Chinatown to Fields Corner, from Cambodia Town to the Buddhist temples in Lowell. They've also made sure bilingual officers are working those beats. 
""We understand a lot of these crimes may go unreported,"" said Boston police Deputy Superintendent James Chin. 
Chin said Boston police have been working closely with Asian American groups to encourage reporting of incidents of any kind. The department is also translating its brochure on civil rights into multiple languages, including Chinese and Vietnamese. 
One of the biggest challenges is that undocumented immigrants fear deportation if they deal with the police. 
""We don't care about their status,"" said Chin. ""Don't be afraid to report."" 
Chin grew up in Chinatown, and his parents are in their 80s. For him, this wave of anti-Asian sentiment ""hits home a little doser."" 
""We are not like New York or San Francisco,"" said Chin, but ""everyone is on edge. ... We want to be vigilant."" 
The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University-San Bernardino has been tracking decades of hate crime data. These acts tend to be vastly underreported, especially among Asian Americans, said the center's director, Brian Levin. 
""This data does not reflect by any means the cumulative impact of actual hate crimes directed against Asian Americans,"" said Levin, a professor of criminal justice. ""What it is effective at is showing the trends, locations, targeting, and timing."" 
Levin has found that Boston, New York, and Los Angeles are often a bellwether for hate crime for the rest of the country. What is troubling about the current climate of anti-Asian bias crimes beyond an overall increase is that the cases have been more violent. 
One way to protect Asian Americans is strengthening hate crimes laws. Representative Grace Meng, a New York Democrat, has introduced legislation calling for greater federal oversight of COVID-19 related hate crimes and requiring the Justice Department to provide Congress with regular updates about bias incidents. In Massachusetts, Long Nguyen's daughter, state representative Tram Nguyen, is co-sponsoring a bill that would bolster the Commonwealth's hate crime statute. 
While some Asian American groups don't agree that legislative fixes are the best way to fight bias, Nguyen, along with Attorney General Maura Healey, sees updating the law as a way to increase accountability in the criminal justice system. 
""It is important to name hate crimes for what they are. They are meant to terrorize communities,"" said Nguyen, a Democrat from Andover: ""This bill is not going to end hate and violence. It will allow justice to be served."" 
Shen, the woman who was shoved to the ground in Medford, still does not feel comfortable reporting the assault to the police. 
Lieutenant Detective Paul Covino of the Medford police said he understands how some victims are wary of law enforcement, and so encourages Shen's friends and support network to report the incident on her behalf. 
""We're here to help her, not to hurt her, or make her look bad,"" said Covino. ""If we have no one reporting to us there are Asian hate crimes going on, we assume there are none going on."" 
Asian Americans are nearly 10 percent of Medford's 57,000 residents. Like Lowell and Quincy, Medford police have not received reports of anti-Asian hate crime over the past year. 
Are we to believe Massachusetts is largely insulated from anti-Asian hate? Or are our society and systems so broken we have lost our way? No community should live in fear, and it's time we fix this.

rallying cry to end asian hate,"Crimaldi, Laura; Hilliard, John",Boston Globe,2021-04-21,"At a busy intersection in Dorchester, along Washington Street in the South End, and on the steps of Quincy City
Hall, demonstrators on Saturday demanded an end to racism against people of Asian descent, who have faced
increased violence and harassment since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.
Four demonstrations organized by different groups unfolded throughout the day, including a rally at Peters Park in
the South End that culminated with a march to Chinatown and drew several hundred supporters.
“Ain't no power like the power of people 'cause the power of people don't stop,"" the marchers called out as they
stepped onto Washington Street just after 3 p.m. to begin their journey to Chinatown. The column of
demonstrators lined up behind a banner that read, “March For Our Asian Futures.""
Sophia Wu, 38, a demonstrator from the Fenway, held a sign that said, “People need to stop confusing xenophobia
with patriotism.""
She said moved to the United States from Taiwan about 18 years ago, but has felt like a foreigner here for her
entire life.
“This is something that really affects my life,"" Wu said.
The event was organized by Asian Coalition Massachusetts, which a group of young activists formed last month
after a gunman killed eight people at Atlanta-area spas, including six women of Asian descent. Investigators have
said the suspect, Robert Aaron Long, who is white, confessed to the killings.
Organizers from Asian Coalition Massachusetts said they want marginalized people within the Asian community to
have a voice, and they detailed policy objectives including fighting gentrification, cutting budgets for police
agencies, and decriminalizing sex work.
“Today is not the only day that we're going to resist, right?"" Joan Dotruong, an organizer from Dorchester, asked
the crowd. “We're going to resist until we get our demands met!""
The crowd included three sisters from North Andover who attended the event with their parents.
One sister, Grace Truong, 20, held a sign that read, “Not your model minority, scapegoat, fetish.""
Media depictions of Asian women as exotic and submissive have received renewed scrutiny since the spa
shootings and revelations that Long claimed to have a sex addiction and targeted what he saw as sources of
temptation. The police account of Long's claims generated backlash, though investigators have said they're still
working to establish a motive, including looking into whether the attacks can be classified as hate crimes.
“No one should be fetishized because of their race or how they look,"" Truong said.
Her sister Linzie, a junior at North Andover High School, held a sign that read, “We are not silent. But are you
listening?"" She said there is a misconception that Asian people are timid.
“We're being overridden by other voices and we don't get the space to really promote ourselves,"" she said.
Sam Lê Shave, a volunteer with the Asian American Resource Workshop, spoke out against immigration policies
that harm the Asian community.
“As we've seen it play out through racist policies throughout history, time and time again, here in the un-United
States, immigrants and refugees to now deportees, alongside many other marginalized people, have been
dehumanized beyond measure in the face of white supremacy,"" she said. “Our communities have been stripped of
resources and deprived and left with nothing. This is not the land of the free. This is not the land of dreams. This is
stolen land.""
The crowd applauded.
Shave also called on the crowd to fight racism directed at Black people.
“We must also address the anti-Blackness within our communities,"" she said. “This is the time to come together,
stand up for one another. Especially in times of injustice, we must show up and show out, and we cannot allow
white supremacy to pit us against each other, because when structural racism affects one of us, it affects all of
us.""
Many blame the latest wave of anti-Asian bias on Donald Trump and the xenophobic rhetoric he used to link
COVID-19 to China, though discrimination against Asian people in the United States stretches back more than 100
years.
The national coalition Stop AAPI Hate received 96 reports from Massachusetts of anti-Asian hate and
discrimination between March 19, 2020, and Feb. 28, according to data released last month. Nationwide, the group
received 3,795 reports of anti-Asian incidents during the same period, it said.
In Quincy, two separate rallies opposing anti-Asian hate were held at City Hall.
Both drew supporters demanding an end to racism, while people also called for unity and offered full-throated
support to members of the city's Asian-American community.
The “Stand Up, Speak Out! Pan-Asian Solidarity Rally,"" held Saturday afternoon, was organized by Quincy For
Transformative Change and other local organizations. Speakers discussed past experiences of racism and voiced
fear about the prospect of violence directed at Asian Americans.
They emphasized common cause with other communities, including Black Americans, who have experienced
racism and violence because of white supremacy.
Ben Hires, chief executive at the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center, highlighted efforts by Quincy residents
to create a city department of social justice and equity, as well as state legislative measures, including new
educational programs, to help combat racism.
He also called for broader investments in creating access to jobs, housing, health care, and other services for
communities of color.
“We need to center transformative justice that begins with cross-racial justice, and community building that
addresses white supremacy as the root cause of violence and hate,"" Hires told participants.
Earlier in the day, people gathered at Quincy City Hall for the “Fight Anti-Asian Hate"" solidarity event organized by a
coalition of local groups, including Quincy Asian Resources Inc.
Philip Chong, the organization's chief executive, said in a statement that the effort was meant to bring people
together.
“This is about all of us,"" Chong said. “This rally is about unity, it is about communication, and it is intended to be a
very loud statement that the city of Quincy is a place where we respect and care about one another.""In Fields Corner, Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito joined a group of demonstrators holding signs denouncing anti-
Asian hate. Drivers passing through the neighborhood honked to show their support.Polito said the Asian American community is “very much a part of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.""
“This community needs to know how important they are to us in the Commonwealth, and they need to know that
we support them and I don't want them to be scared,"" she said. “We care about them. And we need them because
they are very much a part of our future success as a Commonwealth.""
Al Wong, 74, said he is a native of Hawaii and has Chinese ancestors. His relatives in Washington state have been
subjected to verbal abuse, including being told to “go back to China.""
“This racism needs to be, one, recognized, and, more importantly, addressed by all Americans and especially the
government, at every level,"" said Wong, who lives in the North End.
Kei Nguyen, a Quincy resident, said he wanted to be at the Fields Corner event to raise public awareness about the
racism affecting the Asian community.
“I just want to lead by example,"" he said. “We need to have more Asians be vocal and speak up and be leaders.""

""It is important to name hate crimes for what they are. They are meant to terrorize communities,"" said Nguyen, a Democrat from Andover. ""This bill is not going to end hate and violence. It will allow justice to be served."" 
Shen, the woman who was shoved to the ground in Medford, still does not feel comfortable reporting the assault to the police. 
Lieutenant Detective Paul Covino of the Medford police said he understands how some victims are wary of law enforcement, and so encourages Shen's friends and support network to report the incident on her behalf. 
""We're here to help her, not to hurt her, or make her look bad,"" said Covino. ""If we have no one reporting to us there are Asian hate crimes going on, we assume there are none going on."" 
Asian Americans are nearly 10 percent of Medford's 57,000 residents. Like Lowell and Quincy, Medford police have not received reports of anti-Asian hate crime over the past year. 
Are we to believe Massachusetts is largely insulated from anti-Asian hate? Or are our society and systems so broken we have lost our way? No community should live in fear, and it's time we fix this.

National group received 67 reports of anti-Asian hate and discrimination from Mass. in 2020,"Crimaldi, Laura",Boston Globe,2021-02-13,"A year ago, Lunar New Year celebrations unfolded as COVID-19 began spreading globally, ushering in a new
wave of anti-Asian bias stoked by then-President Trump and the xenophobic rhetoric he used in labeling the
disease the “China virus.”
Now, as festivities this weekend mark another Lunar New Year, coronavirus vaccines offer relief from the virus
but not from the racism directed at people of Asian descent, who have seen the bias turn to violence, notably
against the elderly. The cases include the murder in San Francisco of Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thai
man; a subway attack in New York City during which a 61-year-old Flipino man was slashed across the face with
a knife; and several assaults targeting older Asian Americans in the Chinatown section of Oakland, Calif.
“This is not a problem that is new to our community,” Sam Hyun, chairman of the Massachusetts Asian American
Commission, said Saturday. “Even last year when we saw the spike happening, what we heard was a lot of
silence from the media and those in the highest seats of power.”
The national coalition Stop AAPI Hate received 67 reports from Massachusetts of anti-Asian hate and
discrimination between March 19 and Dec. 31, 2020, according to data released Tuesday.
Almost 90 percent of the cases from Massachusetts involved verbal harassment, about 7.5 percent were reports
of people being coughed on or spat upon, and 3 percent were physical assaults, said Russell Jeung, a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate and professor at San Francisco State University.
In one local incident reported to the organization, an Asian-American shopper said a woman at a grocery store
stated, “You will infect us.”
In another report from Massachusetts, a pedestrian said a driver screamed, “You're the reason I have to wear a
mask.” An elementary school teacher in Massachusetts reported that a student taunted a Chinese classmate by
claiming he had COVID-19 and telling other children not to go near him.
Jeung said only a small portion of the incidents reported to Stop AAPI Hate would qualify for prosecution under
most laws against hate crimes.
“To address most of the hate incidents, we need a different type of policy solution and that includes expanded
civil rights enforcement,” he said.
A bill to reform the state's hate crime statute is pending in the Legislature and would expand the law to cover
harassment. Attorney General Maura Healey is co-sponsoring the legislation.
On Tuesday, she encouraged people to report hate crimes against Asian Americans to her office.
“Anti-Asian violence is on the rise,” she wrote. “The recent assaults on our elders are deeply disturbing.”
The state's Asian American Commission has developed a system for collecting reports about hate incidents and
has been using its online platforms to promote resources to combat the violence. Last spring, the commission
published a manual for responding to anti-Asian violence.
While several prominent activists and organizers said they haven't received reports about local Asian
communities being subjected to the same type of violence documented in California and New York, the incidents
have taken a psychological toll.
“It just adds to their level of stress,” said Ben Hires, chief executive of the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood
Center.
Boston City Councilor Ed Flynn, who represents Chinatown, said some of the neighborhood's elderly residents
worry about leaving their homes to buy food or get fresh air because they fear being harassed in public.
“We have to show more empathy to the Asian community for the very difficult year that they've had,” said
Flynn. “They need to know that we're on their side and we're going to do everything we can to be helpful when
there is discrimination and bullying and intimidation or name calling.”
One way some advocates are trying to fight anti-Asian bias is by encouraging bystanders to speak up when they
witness wrongdoing. Distrust of law enforcement, language barriers, and immigration status sometimes prevent
victims from coming forward and that's why it's important for others to step up, they said.
“A lot of the folks that are being targeted, they're not going to be able to defend themselves or they're not going to report it so we need to the community speak up for them,” Hires said.
President Biden addressed the racism, harassment, and hate crimes directed in a video marking the Lunar New Year.
“It's simply wrong,” he said. “It's a stain on our national character. Every person, no matter their race,
background, religion, or language they speak, deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.”
Last month, Biden signed an executive order condemning anti-Asian racism and directed the Department of
Justice to tackle the problem more aggressively.
Jessica “Jay” Wong, interim executive director of the Asian American Commission, said her community needs
to hear more messages of support from local leaders.
“We need our leaders to show that they are actively working to make our community feel safe and not feel
alone,” she said. “None of this should ever be tolerated.”",5081
Back to Normal? Not for Many Asian Americans.,"Healy, Jack",New York Times,2021-06-09,"Facing a wave of animosity many Asian Americans remain afraid of public places even as the coronavirus pandemic recedes. 
Millions of Americans may be leaping into a summer of newly unmasked normalcy. But inside Mandy Lin's apartment in Philadelphia's Chinatown neighborhood the lockdown drags on. 
Her 9-year-old son is struggling through the last lessons of fourth grade on a laptop while many of his classmates are back in school. His grandmother stays inside all day. For exercise Ms. Lin's family paces their building's parking lot or ventures to a nearby park. 
But it is not Covid-19 keeping the family from rejoining a bustling world of restaurants schools and public spaces. 
""It's not safe to be outside"" Ms. Lin 43 said. ""There has just been unending violence and harassment."" 
A surge in anti-Asian attacks during the pandemic is now holding back many Asian American families from joining the rest of the country in getting back to normal. 
As schools phase out remote learning companies summon employees back to work and masks fly off people's faces Asian Americans say that America's race to reopen is creating a new wave of worries - not about getting sick but whether they will be attacked if they venture back onto a bus or accosted if they return to a favorite cafe or bookstore. 
In more than a dozen interviews across the country Asian Americans detailed fears about their safety and a litany of precautions that have endured even as the country has reopened. Some people are still avoiding subways and public transportation. Others are staying away from restaurants. Some dread the return of business travel or the end of remote work. 
Their fears come as attacks continue. Stop AAPI Hate a coalition of community and academic organizations tracked more than 6600 attacks and other incidents targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from March 2020 to March 2021. A survey this spring found that one in three Asian Americans worried about becoming victims of hate crimes. And while nearly three-fifths of white fourth graders are now back in class just 18 percent of their Asian American peers have returned to in-person learning according to federal surveys. 
Asian Americans said they hoped the threats would ebb as more people got vaccinated and the pandemic faded. But person after person echoed the same worry: There is no vaccine against bigotry.
It's embedded itself so deeply"" said Lily Zhu 30 a tech worker in Pflugerville Texas. ""When we got our Covid shots it was marking the end of this weird year where everyone was frozen in time. But there's still this paranoia."" 
Ms. Zhu is fully vaccinated but says she no longer takes the bus and does not know if she will ever again ride on it alone. As she ventures back into public spaces she feels more comfortable at Asian markets like H Mart or the 99 Ranch Market in Austin. 
She worries about her parents in Ohio who have gone back to commuting and taking art classes in downtown Cleveland and who now own a gun for protection. They messaged Ms. Zhu with concern after six women of Asian descent were among eight people shot to death at massage spas around Atlanta in March -- killings that galvanized many Asian Americans to demand political action to address the spike in anti-Asian violence. 
In Philadelphia Ms. Lin is rattled by the stories of violence and verbal assaults against Asian Americans that pop into her WeChat groups: A pregnant woman who was punched in the face. A 64-year-old man attacked not far from the Lin family's apartment by someone shouting anti-Asian epithets. A 27-year-old woman hit in the head without any warning or provocation. 
Ms. Lin said her family had hewed to the same guarded routine even as Philadelphia had celebrated the decline in coronavirus cases by ending capacity limits on businesses and announcing a return to full-time in-person school next autumn. 
She shops for food at nearby markets in Chinatown. Her husband brings home anything else they need from his supermarket job. And every school day she sits beside her 9-year-old son who has autism to help him with his virtual classes. 
Ms. Lin is afraid he is falling further behind by not being around other students but she has deep concerns about sending him back: His safety. The two-mile trip to his school. The fact that he cannot yet get vaccinated. 
The disparities in returning to school have become a particularly urgent concern for groups representing Asian American parents. They worry what will happen next year if their children continue to feel unsafe. The Education Department recently put out a guide for families dealing with anti-Asian bullying and reminded schools that they have a legal obligation to confront the harassment.
But it has not been enough for Ms. Lin. Not yet. 
""I feel really conflicted about what to do to support my child"" she said. 
Anna Perng a community organizer in Philadelphia who has spent the past year calling out anti-Asian hate and getting people vaccinated said she struggled to persuade some wary Chinese American families to attend the city's annual flower show at FDR Park last weekend. 
It is a huge event in a neighborhood that is miles from Chinatown and an anxious step for families who still feel threatened Ms. Perng said. She had gotten discounted tickets and arranged a Zoom chat beforehand to answer their questions. High on the list: What should they do if they felt unsafe and needed to leave in a hurry?
""We are going to have to work hard to help targeted communities feel safe"" she said. 
Many people said they were trying to strike a balance that lets them feel comfortable as much as they can in public. It can be an agonizing calibration just to take a walk: Will wearing a mask act as a shield or attract unwanted attention? Is daytime safer than night? Are largely Asian neighborhoods safer or more likely to be attacked? 
Many residents have also called on the police to increase patrols and some communities have started their own neighborhood watches. 
Some Asian Americans said they were heartened by a new federal law that seeks to strengthen the law enforcement response to a nearly 150 percent increase in anti- Asian attacks many of them aimed against women and older people. 
Still many remain fearful. ""When society is more open that means more threats"" said Jeff Le a political partner at the Truman National Security Project a think tank. 
Mr. Le has returned to much of his prepandemic life but said he is still anxious about getting back on a plane since the day in March 2020 when a woman at the Reno- Tahoe International Airport spit on him and said ""Go back to where you came from."" 
""It was a feeling of helplessness like I'd never felt before"" Mr. Le said. ""That's something I can't shake. It made me feel like I was a cancer or something radioactive."" 
Even as Americans poured back onto planes over Memorial Day the thought of flying again made Mr. Le queasy. He has visited 85 countries and used to travel constantly for work but has been grounded since last year. ""I'm a little more nervous about it than I'd thought"" he said. 
Cathie Lieu Yasuda said she felt safe walking through her hometown Folsom Calif. but said it was still too risky to take her ninth-grade daughter and fifth-grade son to a Giants baseball game. Whenever she and her children go out they follow a new rule of social distancing: Not six feet to stop the spread but arm's length to keep from getting shoved or punched. 
""The sidewalk is big enough"" Ms. Lieu Yasuda said. ""We're not afraid. We're not cowering. We're being safe."" 
After getting vaccinated Augustine Tsui is again commuting from New Jersey to his law-firm job in Midtown Manhattan but he said he does not know when his life or commute will ever feel normal. After years of taking the bus and train he now drives to work and pays as much as $65 in parking the price of easing his family's worries. His wife Casey Sun stays at home making organic soaps and cosmetics for her online business and said she rarely leaves the house. 
Mr. Tsui's office is not far from where an attacker bit off part of an Asian man's finger in mid-May. Mr. Tsui wears a mask to conceal his face as he hustles inside. 
""Instead of getting anti-Asian comments it's not entirely clear who I am"" he said. ""I can just go about my day.""",8327
A Country Just Trying To 'Get Through This': [Foreign Desk],Sarah Mervosh,New York Times,2020-04-05,"A virtual recovery meeting. A police officer donned in a face mask. A pastor without a congregation. A funeral director trying to bury the dead. This is a new America.
The merciless threat slipped into America, emptying its streets, shuttering its stores, wrecking its economy and forcing its people to retreat indoors.
In this new country, once crowded cities now feel abandoned, as if everyone suddenly moved out. There is no rush hour on the nation's highways. ""Closed"" signs hang from the
front doors of business after business.
For many, this coronavirus pandemic involves the most dramatic kind of fight -- for life, for food, for money. For others, it can feel absurdly trifling as they stay inside -- a fight
against boredom, binge eating, isolation.
There was Kalee Kamer, in Portsmouth, Ohio, 27 months sober and motivated to stay that way, participating in a recovery meeting that has moved online. Chris Allison,
patrolling the quiet city of Norman, Okla., in a sanitized police vehicle and with a blue face mask. And the Rev. Rob Lee, a pastor in Newton, N.C., without a congregation,
summoning hope amid the gloom.
This was America over 24 hours this past week, on pause and full-tilt, as the sun rose and then set and then rose again on a profoundly altered nation.
Miami
A trip to a ventanita, in Miami culture, is not just about the $1.82 cup of sweet and foamy cafecito. It is about conversation and gossip, a hangout for nosy retirees and chatty
working stiffs. Queuing is taboo. Wriggling and squeezing are the ways to reach the counter.
Or at least they were.
Flouting social distancing rules, crowds continued to congregate outside ventanitas, so much so that the county mayor threatened to shut them down. Sergio's, where the
espresso machine continues to whirl and buzz, rushed to tape markers -- six feet apart -- on the ground.
Now customers approach with caution, peering through new panes of plexiglass to order. Many scurry off with their provisions tucked in a brown paper bag.
""This is my only outing,"" said Daisy Abreu, 58, who works in magazines and left with one café con leche, one guava pastry and two empanadas.
But first she lingered for a moment to check in with Reinaldo Mesa, a 61-year-old airport contractor who picked up coffee and a medianoche sandwich. He, too, had given up
most everything in his daily routine. Except the ventanita.

Erie, Colo.
Sherry Maloney rolled out of bed, strapped on a face mask and headed for the Safeway. Today was toilet paper day. Maybe.
Rumor had it that a shipment of paper products had come in the night before. By 6:30 a.m., she was standing outside, shivering with her husband, fingers crossed she would
snag a package.
One man was down to three rolls at home. A woman said she was about ready to cut squares out of cloth diapers. ""I've been rationing two squares a trip,"" said Ms. Maloney, 63.
In the grand scheme of things, a toilet paper shortage at home is certainly not the worst crisis. But it is also certainly not normal in a land of plenty.
Inside the locked store, clerks wiped down shopping carts and spritzed the self-checkout stations. Outside, everyone talked about how a trip to the store had devolved into a
Hobbesian supermarket sweep. Jostling lines. Frantic customers. Stressed employees, exposed to God knows what germs for God knows how many hours every day""It's starting to get ugly,"" Ms. Maloney said. But it was friendly in line this morning. Two buddies ran into each other -- ""Don't shake his hand!"" one shouted.
The doors slid open, and Ms. Maloney strode inside.

Atlanta
Tonnia Blount shifted her big yellow school bus into gear and started off on the route she had been running for a decade, only now with no children to pick up and none to drop
off. They were all at home, stuck in little bungalows and apartments scattered across the working-class neighborhoods of southeast Atlanta.
But with nearly four in five Atlanta public school students poor enough to qualify for free or reduced lunch, most still needed their cafeteria calories. So this was Ms. Blount's
work for the foreseeable future: pulling her empty bus in front of Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School, loading it up with brown sacks full of breakfast and lunch, and then
delivering the sacks out in the maze of narrow streets, more like the driver of an ice-cream truck.
""I know my children,"" she said. ""I know who is in need.""
Every few blocks, Ms. Blount, 55, stopped the bus and honked until the parents and grandparents and aunties came out. ""How many babies?"" a co-worker in the back of the bus
would ask them, smiling, handing the bags down.
Sometimes they were not babies at all. Bryan Bush, 19, came out of an apartment in sweats and a hoodie. He had been working at Six Flags Over Georgia, the amusement
park.
Not anymore, he said. He grabbed a sack of breakfast and a sack of lunch.

Boston
Thalia Bardell crouched in front of the laptop she had propped up on a chair, centering it in the roughly three-foot-wide wedge of space between the end of her unmade bed and
a dresser.
""Hi, B!"" she called out to the screen. ""How's the dogs?""
""They're trouble,"" the screen replied.
Ms. Bardell teaches barre exercises, which are modeled loosely after ballet, to mostly women in their 20s, 30s and 40s. When Boston shut down, her clients begged her to come
up with a way to give their minds and bodies a break from idle worry about the pandemic.
Live-streamed exercise instruction was having a moment before the crisis, as home fitness companies like Peloton paired their machines with remote-access instructors. Now
teaching remotely is one of the few options instructors have left.
She called the group to attention. ""All right guys, let's go!"" Nurses, bartenders, teachers and financial analysts appeared on the screen, following her through a routine of squats
and lunges as she snapped her fingers with the precision of a metronome.
""Kerry, that's a beautiful pace!"" she said.
""Maite, lower your hips an inch.""
Ms. Bardell believes in moving quickly so no one has time to dwell on the pain. ""You're in a physically uncomfortable situation right now in your body, and you're in an
emotionally uncomfortable situation in the world,"" she said. ""And it's like, we're going to get through this together, just like we do with every single class.""

Amherst, Mass.
Ariana Lee, a Chinese student stranded on the campus of Amherst College, walked into a dining hall past a pandemic-era warning sign: ""Admittance Restricted.""
The food service workers lit up when they saw her. She greeted them brightly. ""Hi! Can I get the pulled chicken taco over Mexican rice? And some guac with the salsa, please?""
These days, with classes now online, campus feels like a ghost town. In her one-minute walk to the dining hall, Ms. Lee, a senior, encountered only one other person, a janitor
pushing a cart full of cleaning supplies across the common room, like a lone ship leaning into a storm.
The servers wore gloves, but no masks. The open cereal dispensers stood empty. The cafeteria tables were cordoned off.
The food was tastier than it was before the pandemic, she said, but the portions were smaller. She preferred not to pick up food in town, though, because ""people on the street
say racist things."" The other day, a man called her Chinese-American friend a racial expletive and said that wearing a mask would not help.
Her parents have left Beijing and are riding out a two-week quarantine in a small apartment in Hong Kong. They have to wear trackers on their wrists. Food is delivered to their
door. Her mother sprays down every package with disinfectant.
Ms. Lee walked back to her dorm room, unpacked her brown paper bag and laid out her food on her desk: two bananas, an orange, a cardboard bowl of rice, a cardboard box of
chicken tacos. She looked at it, as if it were a still-life painting, and did not eat.

Pittsburgh
The milk incident happened right after lunch, when the 8-year-old was losing patience with long division. It was his second tantrum of the day, the first set off by a missing
sweatshirt. That one had been pretty loud, but at least it didn't involve spilling milk all over the dining room table.
A home-schooling mother as of two weeks ago, Tanying Dong, 39, has been trying to make sure her oldest son does at least some schoolwork every day. When he is absorbed
in a lesson and his little brothers, ages 2 and 5, are nestled in the soft glow of PBS Kids, Ms. Dong can then maybe get to some of the endless other tasks. Such as her payingjob, in public law. And the housework. The meals. The checking-in on friends and relatives.
Three boys, at prime havoc age, with no school, no day care, no babysitter, no playgrounds, no friends and, for much of the time, no other adult.
Amid it all, she has taken up sewing. Specifically, face masks for the whole family. Ms. Dong's husband is a pediatric anesthesiologist, and while the children's hospital is not yet
a battlefield infirmary like so many urban emergency rooms, things could change quickly.
The sewing had been going pretty well until the 5-year-old knocked the sewing machine on the floor. Her husband seems to have fixed it. She'll know tonight when she picks it
back up, once the kids are in bed.

Norman, Okla.
Police Officer Chris Allison pulled over a red Chrysler 300 sedan, approached from the passenger side and asked the driver for his license and insurance. The man pulled the
papers from his glove compartment and leaned toward the window. But Officer Allison didn't touch them.
He reached instead for his cellphone.
""OK, I'm just going to take a picture of that,"" Officer Allison told the man.
Officer Allison, 34, patrols southwest Norman, where a stay-at-home order is in effect and four nursing home residents have died from the pandemic. Norman is different now,
and so is policing. The most prosaic parts of the job have become potential hazmat situations.
Officers used to sit two to a table for pre-shift briefings at headquarters, but social distancing put an end to roll call. Officers also keep their distance from one another when
they go out on calls. On Tuesday, the officer's lunch got a wipe-down: He used Clorox wipes to disinfect his milkshake, tea and wrapped straws.
At the end of his shift, he used to park his police S.U.V. outside his house, walk inside and hug his wife, 5-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son. Now, he pulls straight into the
garage, undresses there, stuffs his uniform into the washing machine, disinfects his equipment and then heads straight for the shower before touching anyone.
It turned out that the Chrysler's license plate didn't match the vehicle. Maybe it was stolen. Maybe the driver hadn't registered it yet. From the driver's seat of the S.U.V., the
officer asked for backup. Then he readied himself to face the driver again. He reached over to the passenger seat for his blue cloth mask.

Orlando, Fla.
Kimberley Mitchell, a second-generation funeral director, gathered the grieving family in her office. In the age of social distancing, her only goal was to help them hang on to the
tiniest bit of cultural tradition.
Ms. Mitchell of Mitchell's Funeral Home looked into the eyes of the family representative seated across the room. A month ago, she would have placed her hand on the relative's
shoulder as a gesture of comfort.
On this afternoon, she gently laid out the dizzying, surreal set of safety rules reshaping how America buries its dead. The family settled on a simple half-hour service in the
chapel. It has 22 rows of pews -- room for seven mourners, a pastor and two staff members. They also decided to hold a memorial service once the country returned to normal.
""It feels something like 'to be continued' for some people saying goodbye to their loved ones,"" she said.
Before the crisis, Ms. Mitchell greeted family members reeling from loss with hugs. Now, it was simply too risky. Now mourners had to move through reposing rooms in shifts,
one small group at a time.
It was jarring. And exhausting. And unmooring.
But Ms. Mitchell still had her smile and her words. She could still offer hope and the promise of healing by reciting from the 30th chapter of Psalms -- ""joy cometh in the
morning.""
""The hardest thing is to see someone grieving alone,"" she said. ""Think about that. Alone.""

Dr. Steven Demetropoulos had been seeing patients since 7:10 a.m. He was tired, but he was also a man on a mission.
He needed to drive home in his pickup truck so he could quickly change clothes before heading back out, straight to City Hall, where he hoped to convince the Council to enact a
curfew.
In February, Dr. Demetropoulos became the mayor of Pascagoula, a Gulf Coast city of about 21,000 people. He ran on a platform of economic growth and beautification.
But now he also makes videos for residents about how to survive the worst public health crisis in decades. ""This is Dr. Steve, your mayor,"" he tells them, dressed in green scrubs
behind the mayor's desk.
Tomorrow he would make another video, about how droplets spread through the air and why it was important that people stay six feet apart.
His advice is not limited to physical health.
""Keep trusting, keep praying,"" he said in one video. ""We will get through this together.""

Kalee Kamer was in bed, snuggled next to her boyfriend and their cat, Dirtball, participating in a drug recovery meeting streaming on Facebook Live.Ms. Kamer -- 27 months sober after decades of addiction to heroin, meth, crack and whatever else she could get her hands on -- lost her burger-joint waitressing job on March
15. She and her boyfriend, Chris Keeton, who is also in recovery, have cleaned the house so thoroughly it practically gleams. They watch four or five virtual recovery meetings a
week.
In this small city, the center of Ohio's opioid epidemic, temptation is never far.
The couple's gazes are fixed on the Facebook session, hosted by a local drug recovery group called Raw Addiction.
Kathy Newman, a drug treatment counselor nearly nine years in recovery, urged viewers like Ms. Kamer to stick with the program. Flurries of emojis rose across the screen as
viewers cheered in support.
Hundreds of comments appeared in real time -- testaments of hope and despair that would, in normal times, be shared face-to-face.
I'm afraid of picking up the needle again ... I need out.
I'm in rehab.
April 6th will be 18 months clean from shooting up. You guys are such a great inspiration.

The schedule promised a matchup between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Colorado Rockies. But Dodger Stadium is empty, its doors locked shut, and outside, the birds are
louder than what is left of traffic in one of America's most congested cities.
All the familiar faces are somewhere else. The guys hawking T-shirts, the guys selling beers out of coolers, the guys scalping tickets, the women cooking bacon-wrapped hot
dogs just before the final uphill into the stadium parking lots, blocked off with signs that now say ""No public access.""
Solitary joggers passed by, one after another, under billboards advertising season tickets for a season in limbo. A man in a surgical mask walked his pug.
Alex Wood, the 29-year-old left-hander, was scheduled to pitch for the Dodgers. Right about now, the Rockies would be finishing batting practice, and Mr. Wood would be in the
clubhouse going over the game plan with his catcher and pitching coach. Instead, he's a few hundred miles away in Arizona, crashing at a teammate's house. He said he was
throwing most days, and just trying to maintain ""some semblance of sanity.""
During what would have been game time, he said, he was doing pretty much what every other American was doing. Eating. Watching television. Sleeping.
Mr. Wood counseled patience for frustrated fans. ""Let that excitement continue to build,"" he said, ""and let it loose once we start our season.""

Donna Danahy was sitting on a mattress in a hotel just off the interstate, queasy from the rising waves of dread and uncertainty.
Ms. Danahy, 58, lost her job as a server at Steak 'n Shake a couple of weeks back when it moved to drive-through only. With that, she lost the income needed to pay the first
month's rent -- $600 -- on what was supposed to be a new studio apartment.
A co-worker she had been staying with left town, leaving Ms. Danahy homeless. For several days she parked her 2006 Toyota Camry in a truck stop, drawing down curtains
attached with Velcro, sliding a sun visor in the windshield and tucking her 5-foot-1-inch frame into the back seat for a nerve-racking attempt at sleep. Sometimes she closed her
eyes and wished she would never wake up. Sometimes she was hard on herself for not securing a more stable existence.
""Leading up to this, I felt all this was self-induced; I did this to myself,"" she said.
The plan had been to move into the new place on April 1. But the landlord told Ms. Danahy she would release her unit if she could not come up with the money by April 14. She
was hired for a $13-an-hour job at a grocery store deli but could not start until she got her birth certificate, which was on its way in the mail.
A social services organization secured her the hotel room for a week. But what would she do once the week was up? She began to cry. It was hard not to feel vulnerable. She
has asthma. She wondered if she would get infected from all the moving around.

Tammy Wiatrowski curled up on a lilac sectional with a writing tray and a floral-patterned journal.
She has been writing in it since early March, after working 57 hours over four days as a charge nurse in a critical care unit. It had dealt with the first spate of the nation's

In the manner of academic scientists during normal times, at the end of a day that was light years from normal, Enrique Lin Shiao led with the data.
Never mind that the prestigious University of California, Berkeley, biology laboratory where he is a postdoctoral fellow was shuttered for regular research studies. Or that Dr. Lin
Shiao, 31, was presenting his results to disembodied colleagues in a Slack channel as he ate dinner.
What mattered was that providing the data to the Food and Drug Administration was a prerequisite for clearance to perform much-needed clinical tests for the new coronavirus.
And the data was good.
""Awesome work,"" typed Jennifer Doudna, a Berkeley professor who runs the Innovative Genomics Institute, as she studied Dr. Lin Shiao's graphs from her living room.
The dearth of tests available to Americans who may be infected has anguished molecular biologists, whose research routinely invokes the basic procedure used to detect virus
genes in a patient's nasal swab.
Dr. Doudna, the co-developer of a gene-editing tool called CRISPR, has transformed the first floor of her institute into a testing center that aims to process at least 1,000
samples a day. But first, the group needed to show the F.D.A. the lowest level of virus its test could detect.
As some of Dr. Lin Shiao's colleagues appended congratulatory ""clapping"" and ""on fire"" icons to the charts that indicated the test was highly sensitive, others looked ahead, to
when they would begin again.

The sky over Central Park was slate gray, with pinpoints of stars dim amid the city's stubborn glow.
The East Meadow, its lush grass preserved by fences and ""Keep Off"" signs for an anticipated summer of sun tanning and picnics, was instead bathed in a sea of white medical
tents brought by truck from North Carolina to aid the city's overwhelmed hospitals.
The tents -- 14 in all -- were empty, save for 68 portable metal beds, neatly laid with identical white sheets and pillows.
Samaritan's Purse, a Christian charity, drove in its own supplies. Once the field hospital gets final administrative approval from health department officials to operate, the city
will supply the patients.
In the I.C.U. tent, there were 10 beds, each accompanied by the most desired piece of medical equipment in the world -- a ventilator, which can cost upward of $50,000.
Samaritan's Purse has used the same field hospital to treat families stricken by Ebola in Liberia, to care for townspeople who had been trapped in rubble after an earthquake in
Ecuador, and to operate on children in Iraq who had been struck by shrapnel launched by the Islamic State.
A few weeks ago, it set up a similar field hospital in Cremona, Italy, the nation with the world's most coronavirus fatalities. This is the first time one of the hospitals has been
deployed in the United States. No one knows how long a field hospital will be needed in the center of Manhattan.

The sky was still dark when the Rev. Rob Lee sat down at his desk, picked up his fountain pen and began to write.
Even in normal times, Mr. Lee, 27, is an early riser. But in the weeks since a pandemic put an end to all routines, including Sunday church, he has been waking up earlier and
earlier, no need for an alarm.
He thinks about his congregation of about 50 regulars and the ""collective pain"" shared across the world right now. He thinks about his wife, who lost hours at her marketing job.
He thinks about his mother, a hospice nurse. And, if he is being honest, he thinks about himself, his own mortality. A year and a half ago, a lung collapsed during an asthma
attack, leaving him especially vulnerable to the outbreak.
A few weeks ago, as the crisis intensified, he issued an online callout for prayer requests and offered to send handwritten letters in return. So far, he has received more than
300:
I am alone in California and far from family.
I just lost my job today.
I feel lonely and unsettled in these times.
Mr. Lee, a descendant of General Robert E. Lee who once made headlines for speaking out against white supremacy and Confederate monuments, sees the current crisis as
another pivotal moment for the country.
Writing back to the supplicants has become both a grounding ritual to calm his own anxieties -- and a small act of resistance.""It's a sense of, we're going to show up,"" he said. ""The coronavirus is terrible, but it's not the fullness of who we are as a people. It's not the end of our story.""

I'm Chinese. That Doesn't Mean I Have the Virus.,Celine Tien,New York Times,2020-03-08,"""If you're scared of me, get up and leave.""LOS ANGELES -- I turned 24 last month. The day before my birthday, I walked into a nail salon to get myself a birthday manicure. After I was seated, a nail technician walked over. She was an Asian woman in her 50s. She sat down and I smiled at her. I couldn't see if she smiled back because she was wearing a face mask.The technician looked at my hands, as if considering their shape, and then suddenly asked, ""Are you Chinese?""""I am,"" I responded. ""Are you?""""No,"" she said quickly, ""I am Vietnamese. We all are in the salon. But are you from-China Chinese?"" She raised an eyebrow, her tone like the edge of a blade, sharp and cold.I shifted uncomfortably in the seat, suddenly very aware she was holding my hands. ""I'm from mainland China and Taiwan.""""You know, we are scared of you Chinese people,"" she said loudly, because you eat ""weird"" food ""and bring it here. Chinese people, I don't like you, you are so bad, so bad and so gross.""There was a moment when I couldn't even hear what she was saying anymore. I could only focus on the slight shifts in her face mask as she continued to rant.Finally, my voice cracking, I said: ""I just came back from China in January. If you're scared of me, get up and leave.""The technician went silent. The manager, who had been listening nearby, ran over to intervene. When I looked up, I realized everyone in the salon had been listening. I turned to the woman on my right, then to the other workers who were to my left. Each person I turned to looked away. The room was silent.The manager made my nail technician leave and apologized quietly, offering a free manicure. I bit my lips to stop the trembling.This past month, I've made less eye contact with people when I've walked outside. When I felt like coughing, I smothered the urge by biting my tongue. When I went to shake someone's hand at a party, I instinctively scanned their arm for the tiniest jerk back, a moment of hesitation. When I went to a restaurant in Santa Monica, Calif., the awareness of my being the only Chinese person sat heavier in my gut than anything I ate at lunch.All the while, I watched news headlines snowball from unforgiving takedowns about Chinese people and their supposed ""hygiene problems"" to random pictures of Asian-Americans walking down the street splayed as cover art for articles about non-Asian coronavirus patients.It dawned on me: Sensational reporting and social media were making fear more contagious than the virus itself.I realized my friends in the United States read only the headlines about the coronavirus but knew nothing about the stories behind them. They didn't hear from our family friend whose mother, a doctor, flew from Guangdong Province to Wuhan to volunteer with thousands of other hospital workers. They didn't see the lines etched into doctors' and nurses' faces from wearing face masks and goggles nonstop for weeks.My non-Asian friends don't have friends in China who carefully ration their meals into daily slivers because supermarket shelves are empty. They don't see the internet activity in cities across Asia, where people come together to comfort one another during quarantine, to be together even when they are apart.People in America aren't sharing enough of these stories because what they really want to share is fear. Fear generated by the headlines that my friends whisper about over every meal.Fear arouses us more. Fear is viral. When fear is coursing through every group chat, Instagram story, news headline, people don't stop to ask: Are we hurting anyone by perpetuating it?After I rushed home from the nail salon that day, my mother and I called the owner. We asked her to let us come into her store and speak to her staff. The owner agreed.The next morning, my mother, two friends and I gathered in a circle with the entire salon staff of Asian women. At first, no one said anything. But slowly, one by one, they started asking questions that revealed their foremost fear: the coronavirus death rate.I brought up a report by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention: It had the Covid-19 fatality rate at 2.3 percent. The latest report from the World Health Organization shows the global fatality rate at 3.4 percent, but the rate varies from country to country. In South Korea, where thousands have been tested and 35 have died, the rate is currently about 0.6 percent.And considering that the number cases that are not reported -- because of mild symptoms -- is probably high, epidemiologists believe that the death rate could be under 1 percent, and even lower in China once you look outside of Wuhan. About 80 percent of Covid-19 cases appear to be mild and do not require medical treatment. They resolve on their own. Chinese analysts have found that 1.2 percent of Covid-19 cases are completely asymptomatic.We also talked about how perpetuating harmful stereotypes that Chinese people eat ""weird"" food can be detrimental not just to Chinese people but also to all Asians. After all, to many Americans, we all look the same.My voice a little unsteady, I shared with the women that the incident in the salon left me shaky for the rest of the day. That by nighttime, my anger had melted away to tears, leaving me collapsed on the couch.But something haunted me more than the nail technician's rant: The silence in the room when everyone heard it.Silence is deafening. Silence is enabling. In my family people call me the pit bull because I'm the first to fight back if someone attacks my people. In the one moment I tried and failed to be my own pit bull, no one stepped in to be mine.At the end of our conversation, there was a brief silence, and then a woman stepped forward. She said quietly: ""This has happened to me too. People said bad things to me, too, because of virus."" The manager, who had been profusely apologizing, stopped. Her face softened to sadness.""Customers come in and ask me again and again, am I Chinese, have I been to China, do I have the virus,"" she said.""I didn't know what to say before when people say bad things. Now I know.""The coronavirus is serious. It is worth taking protective measures against. I am also wary of it. But in the past few weeks, I've learned to be fearful of things possibly more contagious than Covid-19: racism and the silence of those who witness it.If you see someone like me being harassed or attacked, step in. Say something. If you can't say something, at least check on the person afterward. Share facts on social media about Covid-19, not fear.I have a little brother I want to protect and parents who I hope can walk into a store and not be made to feel inhuman. With every word I write, I think: We cannot forsake love even in fear, because that's when we need it most.Celine Tien is the founder and chief executive of Flowly: Relaxation Training, a mobile virtual reality app for chronic pain and anxiety management.",6918
Call It ‘Coronavirus’,The Editorial Board,New York Times,2020-03-24,"Disease and prejudice have long gone hand in hand. We can do better in 2020.We’ve been down this road before, too many times. In the 14th century the Black Death provoked mass violence against Jews, Catalans, clerics and beggars; when syphilis spread in the 15th century, it was called variously the Neapolitan, French, Polish and German disease, depending on who was pointing the blame; when the plague struck Honolulu in 1899, officials burned down Chinatown. And so on, down to our times, when epidemics like Ebola, SARS and Zika fueled animus toward specific regions or peoples.Here we are in 2020, with Asians being assailed across the United States and around the world as purported sources of the “Chinese flu,” the “Wuhan coronavirus” or simply the “foreign virus.” Once again, a mysterious, fast-spreading and sometimes lethal disease is exacerbating racism and hatred — only now with the help of the potent megaphone of social media.As the coronavirus has spread from its beachhead in Wuhan, China, old anti-Asian prejudices have spread with it, from the “Yellow Peril” canard that led to the lynching of Chinese in the 1870s to stereotypes of Chinese as dirty and decrepit.As The Times reported on Monday, Chinese-Americans and other Asians lumped together with them by racists are being beaten, spat on, yelled at and insulted from coast to coast, driving some members of the maligned minority to purchase firearms in the fear of worse to come as the pandemic deepens.The United States is not alone in this blight of xenophobia. Japan’s Kyodo News agency described similar incidents of anti-Asian bigotry wherever the coronavirus has struck: Asian students pelted with eggs in Leicestershire, England, or people in Egypt yelling out “corona” when passing Asians in the street. Vile posts on social media have made graphic threats in rants against Asians over the coronavirus.However much mystery still surrounds the coronavirus, these are not the Dark Ages, and there really should be no reason to remind people that this terrible new virus makes no distinction among races or nations. Though it makes good medical sense to keep a distance from people who have been to an area with a high rate of infection — which today is effectively anywhere — it is foolish and malicious to hold the Chinese (or any other) people responsible for the spread of the virus, or to assume that they are somehow more likely to be its carriers.A time of great fear and danger requires solidarity, humanity, sacrifice and hope, and not hysteria or hatred. That should be the message of the world’s political, social, religious and corporate leaders as they race to find ways to cope with the lethal virus. Many leaders have done just that.It is more than unfortunate, then, that President Trump, some members of his cabinet and some conservative politicians have opted to fan the bigotry by deliberately using the term “Wuhan virus” or “Chinese virus.” Mr. Trump, who spent previous months calling it the coronavirus, started defending the use of “Chinese virus” last week. Photographs of a text of the speech he was reading seemed to show “Corona” lined out and “Chinese” written in the president’s hand. Mr. Trump tweeted support of the Asian-American community on Monday, but his many supporters online had already embraced his formulation.In tying the virus to China, the president has also adopted the argument of Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, that referring to Wuhan or China is payback for Chinese disinformation and for Beijing’s delay in letting the world know of the outbreak. Of course, it is possible to hold the Chinese government accountable for its handling of the crisis and its spread of misinformation without maligning a nation of more than 1.3 billion people or the people of Chinese descent who make their homes in nations around the world.The xenophobia and prejudices that result from naming new infectious diseases after places, people or animals are the reasons the World Health Organization has urged against doing so, and instead using generic descriptive terms like “coronavirus.” Names like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Spanish flu, swine flu or monkey pox, the W.H.O. said, can have serious consequences, whether provoking a backlash against members of a particular community or prompting needless slaughter of food animals.In the end, though, the anti-Asian hatreds spread by the coronavirus are not solely the product of politics, but of the deep fears that have always accompanied the outbreak of lethal pathogens. It is for all Americans to try, in whatever ways they can, to remain united and compassionate as the disease invades all facets of our lives.",4692
Why I’ve Stopped Telling People I’m Not Chinese,Euny Hong,New York Times,2020-05-17,"When confronted with racism toward anyone, our instinct should be indignation, not deflection.Mid-February, when the world was starting to go pear-shaped, I had to travel to an area where I’d previously experienced anti-Asian sentiment. So a few days before the trip, I emailed my (white) hairdresser frantically: “I know this sounds crazy but can you can make me blonde? I’m traveling next week and I’m worried about being mistaken for Chinese and blamed for the coronavirus.”Let’s skip the ridiculousness of the idea for a second to focus on the important bit: Why had I worded my request so offensively? I could have just said I was worried about xenophobia. Why was I throwing people of Chinese descent under the bus? It’s like that old joke about the two people running away from a bear: You don’t have to outrun the bear, you just have to outrun the other guy. Except in this case: You don’t have to deal with racism; you just have to make people racist at someone else.My panic was a humbling reminder that I should never be overly confident that I would do the right thing in the face of fear. Sure, wanting to avoid racial profiling is a survival instinct. But survival instincts are often amoral and, if unchecked, can easily turn ugly.I ended up not dyeing my hair because a sudden allergy attack made it ill advised. Also, it was stupid.But I shared my anxiety with a half-Chinese-American, half-white friend. What if I get stopped at the airport for extra screening? I asked. She messaged, “Carry around a copy of your books to prove you’re Korean.” (Two of the books I wrote have the word “Korean” in the title.) She added: “I’m serious.”I messaged “LOL,” dismissed her idea for about 10 minutes … and then put copies of my books in my carry-on bag.What was my plan? To run up to someone hurling epithets and say, “Hey I think we can all agree this Covid stuff is all China’s fault, but good news, I’m Korean! You know, the ones who brought you BTS? So we’re good, right?”This impulse isn’t exactly new, even if the pandemic has brought out its most sinister form. I’ve been doing it since I was a child. Worse, I was taught to do it.When I was a kid in late-1970s suburban Chicago, anti-Chinese taunts were a daily occurrence. It was a frequent topic at Korean church — the only place we clapped eyes on other Koreans outside our own homes. Our parents and Sunday school teachers told us that the correct response was, “I’m not Chinese; I’m Korean.” (This didn’t even work, it should be noted: When I informed a mean kindergartner that I was Korean, he responded, “There is no such place.”)None of us kids were proud of being Korean-American back then. The grown-ups tried to counter this shame by instilling ethnic pride. But despite their good intentions, they invited pride’s ugly sibling: implied permission to step on other people.For an inarticulate child, maybe “I’m not Chinese” isn’t an especially meaningful retort. But a grown woman should know better.So what finally brought about my moment of self-reckoning? It was a T-shirt.Last month, a Chinese-American friend of mine posted on social media about a targeted internet ad that had outraged her. In the wake of Covid-19, some clothing vendor saw a business opportunity: a series of T-shirts with slogans like, “I’m Asian but I’m not Chinese,” “I’m not Chinese, I’m Korean,” “I’m not Chinese, I’m Malaysian,” etc. Her friends’ comments under her post were equally indignant. (So much for predictive algorithms, by the way.)My first thought was, “I wish we’d had these shirts when I was a kid.”And then I stopped myself, horrified.By way of context — not justification — Asians have been siccing people on other Asians for ages. In World War II-era America, some Asian-owned businesses posted signs in their windows specifying that they were not Japanese. I have even met a few Asians of that generation who currently believe that it made political sense for Franklin D. Roosevelt to put Japanese-Americans in internment camps. Just the Japanese.Which is not to say that mislabeling isn’t dangerous; it can even be deadly. In Highland Park, Mich., in 1982, there was an incident that all Asian-Americans of a certain age remember vividly: A Chinese-American named Vincent Chin was murdered in a strip club by two white autoworkers who assumed he was Japanese — one of the people who, they believed, had destroyed the American auto industry.It was a tragic case of mistaken identity. But to respond to that horrific incident with “Vincent Chin wasn’t even Japanese!” is to create a dangerous distraction from the core issue: It is never OK to attack anyone based on their race.But what I’ve come to realize over the past few weeks is that even if I don’t identify with that designation and find it overly broad, like it or not, it shapes how people see me. The only path forward for any of us requires a united front.If someone says, “You Chinese are killing us,” I am in that moment Chinese. Whether I give the other person a piece of my mind or not — awkward, perhaps, from six feet away— my instinct should be indignation, not deflection. Because one of many lessons I’ve learned from the pandemic and its consequences is that focusing on being misidentified by a xenophobe is nothing better than trying to negotiate a more accurate insult.",5319
Art Rebuffs Discrimination: [Correction],Lauren Messman,New York Times,2020-11-05,"After a wave of anti-Asian discrimination, the artist Amanda Phingbodhipakkiya wanted to ""turn these hurts into something beautiful."" Her panels will transform a Brooklyn subway station.On Tuesday, New Yorkers commuting through the Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center subway station will find it transformed with vibrant portraits of Black, Asian and Pacific Islander people along with anti-discriminatory messages like ""I did not make you sick"" and ""I am not your scapegoat.""The series is the work of the neuroscientist turned artist Amanda Phingbodhipakkiya (pronounced PING-bodee-bak-ee-ah). In August, Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya was named a New York City Public Artist in Residence through a program that has partnered artists with city agencies since 2015. She is one of two artists currently embedded with the city's Commission on Human Rights, which invested $220,000 in this campaign.Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya's ""I Still Believe in Our City"" series was created as a response to a grim statistic. From February to September, the Commission received more than 566 reports of discrimination, harassment and bias related to Covid-19 -- 184 of which were anti-Asian in nature. It's a troubling spike not just appearing in New York, but in Asian-American communities across the country.""My goal with this art series was to turn these hurts into something beautiful and powerful,"" Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya said in a phone interview. She added, ""I really wanted to find a way to say, despite everything we have faced as Asian-Americans and New Yorkers, that I still believe in New York.""From Nov. 3 to Dec. 2, the series of 45 pieces will be displayed in the Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn, a central hub that serves a diverse group of commuting New Yorkers. Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya said that it was also the site of a reported, Covid-related bias incident in March, when a 26-year-old Asian-American man reported he was spat on.A description of that incident has been included in one of the pieces, alongside portraits of Asians and flowers that Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya said have symbolic meanings in Chinese and East Asian cultures. Other panels offer information and historical context about the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and statistics about Asian-owned businesses.The series also features portraits of Black people as a sign of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and as a larger call to end institutional racism.""As you traverse the terminal and look upon Asian and Black faces, full of defiance and strength, and learn about the injustices that we've faced,"" Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya said, ""you can't help but see us and you can't help but feel that we are reclaiming space.""For Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya, whose parents are Thai and Indonesian, the series is personal. Growing up in Georgia before moving to New York 14 years ago, she said she and her family experienced anti-Asian bias firsthand. Through this series, she wanted to amplify those experiences, and those of others in her community, which oftentimes go unnoticed.""My art has always been about making the invisible visible,"" she said. ""I've explored everything from microscopic universes to outer space and things that just can't be seen with the naked eye. And I think struggles of communities of color are often invisible.""After a monthlong display in Atlantic Terminal, art from the series will appear around various points of the city in bus shelters, LinkNYC kiosks and Department of Transportation display cases. There are also plans for a hand-painted mural to appear in the city, with the exact location yet to be announced.",3591
'No Vaccine for Racism': Asian New Yorkers Still Live in Fear of Attacks,"Watkins, Ali & Bromwich, Jonah E.",New York Times,2021-07-14,"NEW YORK - The surveillance video captures a brutal scene: A woman is thrown down a flight of stairs and smacks into the subway platform violently enough to fracture a bone in her face. It was May 28 and the woman in her 60s was among dozens of people attacked during a spate of anti-Asian violence this year. It may not even have been the first such attack by the suspect John Chappell a law enforcement official said. Two months earlier Chappell who had dozens of prior arrests had been suspected of lighting an Asian woman's backpack on fire the official said. He was released just days after his arrest in May.Six months into a series of brutal attacks on people of Asian descent across the city Chappell's case underscores the challenges police and prosecutors have faced in both preventing the violence and punishing those responsible. Many of the attacks are unpredictable and carried out by people in the throes of mental health episodes seemingly at random. Officials say they doubt many of the hate crime charges related to the attacks will stick in court and those arrested are often released quickly. And the Police Department appears to have scaled back its efforts to stop them: An undercover unit intended to prevent anti-Asian attacks has not been active since May after officers faced threats of violence themselves.But the attacks have continued and anxiety and trauma still grip many pockets of the city's Asian communities where the violence feels fresh even as the spotlight on it has dimmed. ""There's still this fear that permeates throughout the community"" said Chung Seto a community leader and political strategist in Chinatown.For many she said the fear feels like a continuation of the darkest days of 2020 when city residents were afraid of going outside because of the coronavirus. Now shop owners in Seto's neighborhood remain concerned about staying open late and elders - including Seto's parents - will not venture outside. ""It's not so much catching COVID"" Seto said. ""There's no vaccine for racism.""Attacks on Asian Americans have shaken cities around the country: In Los Angeles hate crimes against Asian Americans more than doubled in the past year and in Boston Asian American elders are learning how to defend themselves with canes. For New York the problem endures as the city forges ahead with its reopening and visitors once again wander the streets of Chinatown - and many living in the neighborhood say they feel left behind.But for New York's police stopping the attacks before they happen is particularly difficult - even when the person accused has dozens of prior arrests. And even when arrests are made the defendants are often released pending trial corrections records show. Chappell for example was released just a few days after his arrest despite prosecutors seeking high bail. ""It's nice to know there's a task force. It's nice to go on the bus and there's this messaging of anti-Asian hate crimes"" said Kevin Nadal a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ""But what does that actually do?""The challenges continue even as anti-Asian violence keeps rising: As of June 27 reported hate crimes against Asian New Yorkers had increased by 400% compared with the same time frame in 2020 from 21 to 105 according to Police Department statistics. The psychological effects of that violence have scarred entire communities. In South Brooklyn where a community senior center just reopened after closing for the pandemic Don Lee a community organizer said Asian elders have been hesitant to travel to and from its programs. ""There are people who are excited to come back but we know many of the seniors don't feel safe to come out"" Lee said. ""The fear's still very real.""Lee said he knew firsthand that some victims of harassment and hate crimes were no longer reporting the incidents to police because they believed nothing meaningful would be done with their case. ""What is the point right? What is the point?"" Lee said. ""I don't think it's the police. I think it's the system.""Law enforcement officials and experts note that it can be difficult to prosecute cases as hate crimes which require proving the defendant's intent was based on the victim's race or ethnicity. In previous years many suspects might have been arrested on assault or harassment charges without a hate crime designation. ""The public is seeing this rash of attacks on Asian Americans and it is possible that there is a trend happening because of racial animus,"" said Alissa Heydari, a former assistant district attorney in New York City who now helps direct the Institute for Innovation in Prosecution at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ""But to prove it in court when the criminal standard is beyond a reasonable doubt it is really hard to show that a victim was picked in large part because of their ethnicity or gender.""The attacks many of which have been recorded on video and shared widely shocked the conscience of the city. Groups of volunteers now patrol the streets of Chinatown hoping to deter potential attacks. Many Asian New Yorkers say they no longer leave home without pepper spray or established buddy systems. In March the Police Department cobbled together a volunteer group of Asian American officers who work during their time off hoping to stop attacks if they see them happening including a pilot program where undercover officers wandered streets where anti-Asian violence had taken place and was thought to likely reoccur.The plainclothes officers were meant to both lure potential offenders into confrontation and intervene if they saw anti-Asian harassment occurring. But the undercover strategy left officers in tenuous positions and some were nearly attacked according to a law enforcement official familiar with the matter. In one instance an undercover officer who is of Asian descent was approached by a man on a train platform in Queens. The man waved his hand and hat in the officer's face and said ""That's why you peoples are getting beat up"" according to a police report. He was charged with aggravated harassment as a hate crime in April. Another officer was approached by a man in midtown Manhattan who shouted anti-Asian slurs at him and said ""Go back to China before you end up in the graveyard"" using an expletive police said. He was also charged with harassment and menacing as a hate crime.Although it has decreased the use of undercover officers the Police Department continues to maintain a hate crimes task force that specifically deals with anti-Asian incidents. From March 1 to March 30 for example that group made 27 arrests in attacks or harassment against Asian American victims in the city 22 of them were recorded as hate crimes within the Police Department. And in 23 of those 27 incidents people accused in the attacks had previously encountered law enforcement because they appeared to be having mental health episodes according to statistics provided by the police. As in Chappell's case many of those 27 incidents involve the same person. One person was responsible for four separate incidents police said.Stewart Loo a deputy inspector who led the task force for its first 10 months of existence said the unit did not solely investigate hate crimes. The 25 detectives involved also provided help to other units when they investigated crimes that involved Asian victims who did not speak fluent English. Loo who retired this spring said that leading the task force had been demanding. He and the group's other members were not paid for the volunteer hours they put in - instead they worked their normal shifts in addition to their work with the force.For those who work and live in neighborhoods like Manhattan's Chinatown it is tempting to see the city's recovery and assume the worst is over. Md Ali 31 said he had sometimes been nervous in the spring and in the height of the pandemic but his souvenir shop at Mott and Bayard streets was near a police precinct so he felt safe. ""Business picked back up a little bit"" he said. ""If it stays like this maybe we can survive.""",8066

For many she said the fear feels like a continuation of the darkest days of 2020 when city residents were afraid of going outside because of the coronavirus.
Now shop owners in Ms. Seto's neighborhood remain concerned about staying open late and elders -- including Ms. Seto's parents -- will not venture outside.
""It's not so much catching Covid,"" Ms. Seto said. ""There's no vaccine for racism.""
Attacks on Asian Americans have shaken cities around the country: In Los Angeles hate crimes against Asian Americans more than doubled in the last year, and in Boston Asian American elders are learning how to defend themselves with canes. For New York the problem endures as the city forges ahead with its reopening and visitors once again wander the streets of Chinatown and many living in the neighborhood say they feel left behind.
But for New York's police stopping the attacks before they happen is particularly difficult even when the person accused has dozens of prior arrests. And even when arrests are made the defendants are often released pending trial corrections records show. Mr. Chappell for example was released just a few days after his arrest despite prosecutors seeking high bail.
""It's nice to know there's a task force. It's nice to go on the bus and there's this messaging of anti-Asian hate crimes,"" said Kevin Nadal, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ""But what does that actually do?""
The challenges continue even as anti-Asian violence keeps rising: As of June 27, reported hate crimes against Asian New Yorkers had increased by 400 percent compared with the same time frame in 2020, from 21 to 105 according to Police Department statistics. The psychological effects of that violence has scarred entire communities.
In South Brooklyn, where a community senior center just reopened after closing for the pandemic, Don Lee a community organizer, said Asian elders have been hesitant to travel to and from its programs.
""There are people who are excited to come back but we know many of the seniors don't feel safe to come out,"" Mr. Lee said. ""The fear's still very real.""
Mr. Lee said he knew firsthand that some victims of harassment and hate crimes were no longer reporting the episodes to the police because they believed nothing meaningful would be done.
""What is the point right? What is the point?"" Mr. Lee said.
Law enforcement officials and experts note that it can be difficult to prosecute cases as hate crimes, which require proving the defendant's intent was based on the victim's race or ethnicity. In previous years many suspects might have been arrested on assault or harassment charges without a hate crime designation.
""The public is seeing this rash of attacks on Asian Americans and it is possible that there is a trend happening because of racial animus,"" said Alissa Heydari, a former assistant district attorney in New York City who now helps direct the Institute for Innovation in Prosecution at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ""But to prove it in court when the criminal standard is beyond a reasonable doubt it is really hard to show that a victim was picked in large part because of their ethnicity or gender.""
The attacks, many of which have been recorded on video and shared widely, shocked the conscience of the city. Groups of volunteers now patrol the streets of Chinatown hoping to deter potential attacks. Many Asian New Yorkers say they no longer leave home without pepper spray or established buddy systems.
In March the Police Department cobbled together a volunteer group of Asian American officers who work during their time off hoping to stop attacks if they see them happening -- including a pilot program where undercover officers wandered streets where anti-Asian violence had taken place and was thought to likely reoccur.
The plainclothes officers were meant to both lure potential offenders into confrontation and intervene if they saw anti-Asian harassment occurring. But the undercover strategy left officers in tenuous positions and some were nearly attacked according to a law enforcement official familiar with the matter.
In one instance an undercover officer who is of Asian descent was approached by a man on a train platform in Queens. The man waved his hand and hat in the officer's face and said ""That's why you peoples are getting beat up"" according to a police report. He was charged with aggravated harassment as a hate crime in April.
Another officer was approached by a man in Midtown Manhattan who shouted anti-Asian slurs at him and said ""Go back to China before you end up in the graveyard,"" using an expletive the police said. He was also charged with harassment and menacing as a hate crime.
Though it has decreased the use of undercover officers the Police Department continues to maintain a hate crimes task force that specifically deals with anti-Asian incidents. From March 1 to March 30 for example that group made 27 arrests in attacks or harassment against Asian American victims in the city, 22 of them were recorded as hate crimes within the Police Department.
And in 23 of those 27 episodes people accused in the attacks had previously encountered law enforcement because they appeared to be having mental health episodes according to statistics provided by the police. As in Mr. Chappell's case many of those 27 incidents involve the same person. One person was responsible for four separate incidents the police said.
Stewart Loo a deputy inspector who led the task force for its first 10 months said that the unit did not solely investigate hate crimes. The 25 detectives involved also provided help to other units when they investigated crimes that involved Asian victims who did not speak fluent English.
Mr. Loo who retired this spring said that leading the task force had been demanding. He and the group's other members were not paid for the volunteer hours they put in -- instead they worked their normal shifts in addition to their work with the force.
For those who work and live in neighborhoods like Manhattan's Chinatown it is tempting to see the city's recovery and assume the worst is over. Md Ali 31 said he had sometimes been nervous in the spring and in the height of the pandemic, but his souvenir shop at Mott and Bayard Streets was near a police precinct so he felt safe.
""Business picked back up a little bit,"" he said. ""If it stays like this maybe we can survive.""

Back to Normal? Not for Many Asian Americans.: [National Desk],"Healy, Jack",New York Times,2021-06-09,"Facing a wave of animosity, many Asian Americans remain afraid of public places even as the coronavirus pandemic recedes.Millions of Americans may be leaping into a summer of newly unmasked normalcy. But inside Mandy Lin's apartment in Philadelphia's Chinatown neighborhood, the lockdown drags on.Her 9-year-old son is struggling through the last lessons of fourth grade on a laptop while many of his classmates are back in school. His grandmother stays inside all day. For exercise, Ms. Lin's family paces their building's parking lot or ventures to a nearby park.But it is not Covid-19 keeping the family from rejoining a bustling world of restaurants, schools, and public spaces.""It's not safe to be outside"" Ms. Lin, 43, said. ""There has just been unending violence and harassment.""A surge in anti-Asian attacks during the pandemic is now holding back many Asian American families from joining the rest of the country in getting back to normal.As schools phase out remote learning, companies summon employees back to work, and masks fly off people's faces, Asian Americans say that America's race to reopen is creating a new wave of worries—not about getting sick but whether they will be attacked if they venture back onto a bus or accosted if they return to a favorite cafe or bookstore.In more than a dozen interviews across the country, Asian Americans detailed fears about their safety and a litany of precautions that have endured even as the country has reopened. Some people are still avoiding subways and public transportation. Others are staying away from restaurants. Some dread the return of business travel or the end of remote work.Their fears come as attacks continue. Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition of community and academic organizations, tracked more than 6,600 attacks and other incidents targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from March 2020 to March 2021. A survey this spring found that one in three Asian Americans worried about becoming victims of hate crimes. And while nearly three-fifths of white fourth graders are now back in class, just 18 percent of their Asian American peers have returned to in-person learning according to federal surveys.Asian Americans said they hoped the threats would ebb as more people got vaccinated and the pandemic faded. But person after person echoed the same worry: There is no vaccine against bigotry.""It's embedded itself so deeply"" said Lily Zhu, 30, a tech worker in Pflugerville, Texas. ""When we got our Covid shots it was marking the end of this weird year where everyone was frozen in time. But there's still this paranoia.""Ms. Zhu is fully vaccinated but says she no longer takes the bus and does not know if she will ever again ride on it alone. As she ventures back into public spaces she feels more comfortable at Asian markets like H Mart or the 99 Ranch Market in Austin.She worries about her parents in Ohio who have gone back to commuting and taking art classes in downtown Cleveland and who now own a gun for protection. They messaged Ms. Zhu with concern after six women of Asian descent were among eight people shot to death at massage spas around Atlanta in March — killings that galvanized many Asian Americans to demand political action to address the spike in anti-Asian violence.In Philadelphia, Ms. Lin is rattled by the stories of violence and verbal assaults against Asian Americans that pop into her WeChat groups: A pregnant woman who was punched in the face. A 64-year-old man attacked not far from the Lin family's apartment by someone shouting anti-Asian epithets. A 27-year-old woman hit in the head without any warning or provocation.Ms. Lin said her family had hewed to the same guarded routine even as Philadelphia had celebrated the decline in coronavirus cases by ending capacity limits on businesses and announcing a return to full-time in-person school next autumn.She shops for food at nearby markets in Chinatown. Her husband brings home anything else they need from his supermarket job. And every school day she sits beside her 9-year-old son who has autism to help him with his virtual classes. Ms. Lin is afraid he is falling further behind by not being around other students but she has deep concerns about sending him back: His safety. The two-mile trip to his school. The fact that he cannot yet get vaccinated.The disparities in returning to school have become a particularly urgent concern for groups representing Asian American parents. They worry what will happen next year if their children continue to feel unsafe. The Education Department recently put out a guide for families dealing with anti-Asian bullying and reminded schools that they have a legal obligation to confront the harassment.But it has not been enough for Ms. Lin. Not yet.""I feel really conflicted about what to do to support my child"" she said.Anna Perng, a community organizer in Philadelphia who has spent the past year calling out anti-Asian hate and getting people vaccinated, said she struggled to persuade some wary Chinese American families to attend the city's annual flower show at FDR Park last weekend.It is a huge event in a neighborhood that is miles from Chinatown and an anxious step for families who still feel threatened, Ms. Perng said. She had gotten discounted tickets and arranged a Zoom chat beforehand to answer their questions. High on the list: What should they do if they felt unsafe and needed to leave in a hurry?""We are going to have to work hard to help targeted communities feel safe"" she said.Many people said they were trying to strike a balance that lets them feel comfortable as much as they can in public. It can be an agonizing calibration just to take a walk: Will wearing a mask act as a shield or attract unwanted attention? Is daytime safer than night? Are largely Asian neighborhoods safer or more likely to be attacked?Many residents have also called on the police to increase patrols and some communities have started their own neighborhood watches.Some Asian Americans said they were heartened by a new federal law that seeks to strengthen the law enforcement response to a nearly 150 percent increase in anti-Asian attacks, many of them aimed against women and older people.Still, many remain fearful. ""When society is more open that means more threats"" said Jeff Le, a political partner at the Truman National Security Project, a think tank.Mr. Le has returned to much of his prepandemic life but said he is still anxious about getting back on a plane since the day in March 2020 when a woman at the Reno-Tahoe International Airport spit on him and said ""Go back to where you came from.""""It was a feeling of helplessness like I'd never felt before"" Mr. Le said. ""That's something I can't shake. It made me feel like I was a cancer or something radioactive.""Even as Americans poured back onto planes over Memorial Day, the thought of flying again made Mr. Le queasy. He has visited 85 countries and used to travel constantly for work but has been grounded since last year. ""I'm a little more nervous about it than I'd thought"" he said.Cathie Lieu Yasuda said she felt safe walking through her hometown Folsom, Calif., but said it was still too risky to take her ninth-grade daughter and fifth-grade son to a Giants baseball game. Whenever she and her children go out, they follow a new rule of social distancing: Not six feet to stop the spread but arm's length to keep from getting shoved or punched.""The sidewalk is big enough"" Ms. Lieu Yasuda said. ""We're not afraid. We're not cowering. We're being safe.""After getting vaccinated, Augustine Tsui is again commuting from New Jersey to his law-firm job in Midtown Manhattan but he said he does not know when his life or commute will ever feel normal. After years of taking the bus and train, he now drives to work and pays as much as $65 in parking, the price of easing his family's worries. His wife Casey Sun stays at home making organic soaps and cosmetics for her online business and said she rarely leaves the house.Mr. Tsui's office is not far from where an attacker bit off part of an Asian man's finger in mid-May. Mr. Tsui wears a mask to conceal his face as he hustles inside.""Instead of getting anti-Asian comments it's not entirely clear who I am"" he said. ""I can just go about my day.""",8292
"With Ads and Hashtags, Fighting Anti-Asian Hatred: [Business/Financial Desk]",Tiffany Hsu,New York Times,2020-07-22,"With more than 2,000 incidents and little action from the federal government, efforts to curtail pandemic-related racism have fallen to P.S.A.s and social media campaigns.A new public service announcement makes a point that federal leaders have largely overlooked: Asian-Americans are facing a surge of harassment linked to fears about the coronavirus pandemic.The spot, which debuted on Tuesday, includes testimonials from a firefighter, a nurse, a driver, an artist, the celebrity chef Melissa King and others, who describe being told to ""go back to China"" or having people spit in their direction.The somber ad, produced by the nonprofit Advertising Council with help from the Emmy-winning writer Alan Yang, ends with a request: ""Fight the virus. Fight the bias.""Anxiety about the novel respiratory virus, which was first detected in Wuhan, China, has fueled xenophobia and bigotry toward people of Asian descent. A coalition of civil rights groups recorded more than 2,100 incidents in 15 weeks; the New York City Commission on Human Rights recently described a ""sharp increase in instances of hostility and harassment.""A list of recent cases compiled by the Anti-Defamation League chronicles ""surging reports of xenophobic and racist incidents,"" including Asian-owned stores defaced with racist graffiti, video chats disrupted by anti-Asian comments and people being beaten or denied entry to businesses.President Trump has repeatedly described the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" and, in recent weeks, as ""kung flu,"" despite saying publicly that it is ""very important that we totally protect our Asian-American community in the United States"" and that the pandemic is ""not their fault in any way."" Inflammatory statements from leaders can exacerbate racist behavior, according to researchers and civil rights leaders.The fight against pandemic-related harassment of Asian-Americans has largely fallen to civil rights groups, marketing agencies, social media accounts and nonprofit organizations, which have promoted hashtags like #IAmNotCovid19, #RacismIsAVirus, #HealthNotHate, and #MakeNoiseToday.Asiancy, an affinity group of the Wieden + Kennedy Portland ad agency, posted a video in May about the repercussions of recent anti-Asian discrimination. The marketing firm IW Group recruited actors, musicians, designers and influencers to participate in the #WashTheHate campaign.The Ad Council, which also introduced a face mask initiative with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York this month, will roll out the new anti-harassment campaign online and on television.The issue of racism toward Asians hit ""very close to home,"" said Mr. Yang, who is known for popular shows like ""Parks and Recreation"" and ""Master of None."" He had just finished directing and publicizing ""Tigertail,"" a family drama made for Netflix featuring a nearly all-Asian and Asian-American cast.One of the lead ""Tigertail"" actors, Tzi Ma, was at a Whole Foods store in Pasadena, Calif., early in the outbreak when a man approached in a car and told Mr. Ma that he ""should be quarantined,"" Mr. Yang said. Later, during an interview with Mr. Yang on Instagram Live, viewers left comments saying he and the interviewer, an Asian man, were the same person.""This wasn't an abstract idea to me, something theoretical,"" Mr. Yang said. ""I knew people this was happening to."" He described the production process as ""an emotionally fraught time,"" when he toggled between overseeing the shoot over Zoom and attending Black Lives Matter protests.The result, Mr. Yang said, is a rare example of a nationwide marketing effort focused on Asian issues, represented by Asian-Americans from a wide range of backgrounds.""It's very meaningful to me,"" he said. ""I never saw this growing up.""In a Pew Research Center survey, 58 percent of English-speaking Asian-American adults said expressions of racist or insensitive views about Asians had become more common since the pandemic began. More than 30 percent said they had encountered slurs or racist jokes in recent months, and 26 percent said they feared being threatened or physically attacked because of their race -- a higher percentage than for Black, white and Hispanic adults.But many Americans, including several non-Asian members of the production team working on the Ad Council's campaign, have been unaware of pandemic-related racism, Mr. Yang said.Steven Moy, the chief executive of the Barbarian ad agency, said campaigns like this one were ""a good starting point.""""I don't know if this is enough, or how effective it will be, but let's do baby steps and create awareness,"" he said. ""I have not seen enough of this -- we should do more.""",4657
'I Am Going to Physically Explode': Pandemic's Demands Make 'Mom Rage' Soar,Minna Dubin,New York Times,2020-07-12,"With coronavirus concerns, stay-at-home orders, financial instability and mounting civil unrest, it is no surprise that mothers are experiencing intensified anger.After I wrote a personal essay on mom rage in 2019, strangers on Twitter declared me an unfit mother. But I expected Twitter-hate. What I did not expect were the many emails I received from mothers around the world, saying they too struggle with mom rage and my story made them feel less alone.After the initial flood of emails, a trickle continued over the next six months. Then Covid-19 happened, and with it, stay-at-home orders. My inbox began lighting up again, illuminating a direct correlation between mom rage and sheltering in place.""Mom rage"" is the colloquial term for the unrestrained anger many women experience during pregnancy, postpartum and beyond.It is a popular topic these days in a support group for working moms at The Motherhood Center, a clinical treatment facility in Manhattan that offers services for pregnant and postpartum women. Paige Bellenbaum, a group facilitator and the center's founding director, said, ""Mom rage is something we talk about all the time. Social isolation, lack of support, managing high levels of anxiety and stress -- this is the new normal of being a mother, and during the pandemic in particular.""Anger and rage are waving red flags hinting at feelings below the surface. Mothers who experience rage may be feeling alone, unheard, and unsupported, Bellenbaum said. ""But it's so much more powerful to feel angry and rageful than to touch the vulnerability of what lives behind it.""Between stay-at-home orders, Covid-19 health concerns, financial instability (or fear of it), police violence against Black people, it is no surprise that mothers are experiencing intensified rage above the surface, and feelings of grief, fear, and loneliness below.""We're asking all parents, but it's especially moms on the front lines, to try to do 24/7 child care without a break at the same time that they're trying to often hold down a job,"" said Laura Markham, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist, parenting coach and author of ""Peaceful Parent, Happy Kids: How to Stop Yelling and Start Connecting."" ""So, is there more mom rage?"" she asked. ""How could there not be?""Mom rage expresses itself in different ways. Anya Persaud, who has a 3-year-old and a newborn and lives in Beacon, N.Y., could pinpoint her fury: ""Raising my voice and walking hard are signs I'm heading from frustration to rage.""Molly Caro May, who lives in Bozeman, Mont., and is the author of ""Body Full of Stars: Female Rage and My Passage into Motherhood,"" said of her rage, ""I never hurt anyone, but I was out in the forest throwing rocks at trees.""Moms aren't supposed to yell and stomp and throw rocks, and we aren't supposed to share our rage publicly. I have wondered if I've been able to write openly about mom rage without much reproach because it has become so commonplace in our lexicon, or if it is because I am white.Nefertiti Austin, the author of ""Motherhood So White: A Memoir of Race, Gender, and Parenting in America,"" wasn't familiar with the term ""mom rage,"" but acknowledged that the intense anger is somewhat universal for moms. Of Black mothers, Austin said: ""It's tricky for us, because we are already saddled with 'angry Black woman.' I definitely don't want to be described as having mom rage, because it's not going to play the same if I say I have it, than if a white mom says she has it.""Austin added that because of racist stereotypes, Black mothers are under more pressure to appear perfect. With police violence against Black people, Austin said, Black mothers may have their ""children on a tighter leash than white parents.""""The whole 'kids will be kids' thing? We know that that's not true when it comes to our kids. There isn't a lot of grace for Black children,"" Austin said.That fear and perfectionism can only add fuel to the mom-rage fire.Since viewing the video of George Floyd's death, Persaud said her mood and sleep have suffered. ""I've had overwhelming anxiety and feelings of hopelessness and helplessness.""Duan said one of the factors affecting her mom rage is ""the trauma of being Asian-American during the pandemic,"" after some, including President Trump, have blamed China for the coronavirus outbreak. The attack has led to a surge in xenophobia against Asian-Americans.It's been a few months since the pandemic began and several weeks since protests against police violence filled our neighborhoods. All the while, mothers continue to work multiple jobs at once (teacher and mom at a minimum), and they're exhausted. May said she vacillates between ""this week, we're going to study cities of the United States"" and ""actually, we're just going to be outside playing with sticks.""Like May, Duan concedes her bandwidth has been lower since Covid-19. ""I think it goes hand-in-hand with my resignation,"" she said. ""I'm fine with the kids just messing around and occasionally learning.""Persaud is having similar throw-up-her-hands moments these days. ""Where before I might have raised my voice, now I give in,"" she said. She will allow her son to skip a nap or eat with the television on. ""Surely, we can't yell and scream every day, right?""This ""laissez faire"" parenting style seems more than warranted during this strange, stuck-at-home period. But how can mothers fill up their tanks above empty? Is self-care even possible for mothers during the coronavirus era?May described her self-care during the pandemic as ""feast or famine."" ""Some weeks, I'm on it,"" she said. ""I exercise, feed myself beautiful food, get some quiet time, and I feel really good. Other weeks I'm literally eating butter on bread in the corner of my kitchen eight times a day. It can feel like I just need to get my basic needs met and everyone is in the way of that.""When I asked Persaud how she makes time for herself, she answered unequivocally, ""Showers!"" Whitney Sandoval, who lives in Wichita, Kan., with her 5- and 3-year-olds, will drive to pick up her groceries and then hang out in her car in the parking lot. ""I listen to music or a podcast, read or just sit in silence. It's the closest I can get to being alone.""Eating properly, exercising, showering and getting a little alone time sound like they belong in the ""basic health requirements"" category as opposed to ""self-care for mothers.""Even if those bare minimum self-care needs are met, mom rage doesn't just disappear. Rage has something to say and, according to Dr. Markham, ""Rage doesn't dissipate until it feels heard.""Ruth King, an educator, life coach, meditation teacher and the author of many books, including ""Healing Rage: Women Making Inner Peace Possible"" and ""Mindful of Race: Transforming Racism from the Inside Out,"" said: ""Rage sits at the crossroads of personal transformation. Rage is not to be understood as a useless emotion, empty of knowledge. Rather, rage is fierce clarity and untapped fuel -- when we push rage away, we can't learn from it.""Unfortunately, many mothers are doing just that. It is a challenge to find mothers who will talk on the record for this article. One mom eagerly emailed me about her rage, but then declined being quoted, saying, ""You know, mom shame.""Bellenbaum of The Motherhood Center said, ""There's so much guilt that we feel toward ourselves, and a kind of inner-disappointment that we have these types of feelings at this intensity, especially toward our children.""It can be challenging for partners living with those who have mom rage to be able to offer compassion and support, especially during the pandemic, when the emotional bandwidth of all parents is stretched thin.In support groups at The Motherhood Center, Bellenbaum has seen mothers find the nonjudgmental witnesses they need in each other. She said, ""When we connect with other women who are having the same feelings, that sense of community creates an initial and immediate relief.""I have experienced this relief myself. What the mothers who write to me about their mom rage don't know is that their emails help me feel less alone, too. Since the pandemic began, people have been clapping, singing and howling into the night at a certain hour. Some clap to thank essential workers. Others howl in grief or just to relieve stress. Maybe it's time for mothers to take to the windows and bellow out a collective earsplitting roar.",8401
"As Coronavirus Spreads, So Does Anti-Chinese Sentiment",Motoko Rich,New York Times,2020-01-30,"In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDon’tComeToJapan has been trending on Twitter. In Singapore, tens of thousands of residents have signed a petition calling for the government to ban Chinese nationals from entering the country.In Hong Kong, South Korea and Vietnam, businesses have posted signs saying that mainland Chinese customers are not welcome. In France, a front-page headline in a regional newspaper warned of a “Yellow Alert.” And in a suburb of Toronto, parents demanded that a school district keep children of a family that had recently returned from China out of classes for 17 days.The rapid spread of the coronavirus that has sickened about 9,800 people — the overwhelming majority in China, with all of the 213 deaths there — has unleashed a wave of panic and, in some cases, outright anti-Chinese sentiment across the globe.While officials scramble to contain the crisis — the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency and the State Department issued a “do not travel” to China advisory — fears over the dangerous outbreak have fueled xenophobia. And the wave of spreading panic has, at times, far outstripped practical concerns.At a time when China’s rise as a global economic and military power has unsettled its neighbors in Asia as well as its rivals in the West, the coronavirus is feeding into latent bigotry against the people of mainland China.“Some of the xenophobia is likely undergirded by broader political and economic tensions and anxieties related to China, which are interacting with more recent fears of contagion,” said Kristi Govella, an assistant professor of Asian studies at the University of Hawaii, Manoa.Some of the response to the outbreak can be seen as a rational calculation based on the risk of infection: Airlines are canceling flights to Wuhan, the center of the epidemic, and other Chinese cities, and conference organizers are asking Chinese delegations not to attend.Late Thursday, Italy’s prime minister said that his country had blocked all flights to and from China. And countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, Russia and Vietnam have temporarily stopped issuing certain classes of visas to travelers from Hubei Province, where Wuhan is situated, or China altogether.“I think it is time to put a temporary ʻdo not enter’ sign on our doorstep for visitors from China,” said Ralph Recto, a lawmaker in the Philippines.Bangkok residents are avoiding malls that are particularly popular with Chinese tourists. A plastic surgery office in the wealthy Gangnam neighborhood of Seoul has instructed employees that they can see Chinese customers only if they can prove that they have been in South Korea for 14 days or more, the potential period that the virus can lie dormant.At a sushi restaurant in the neighborhood that once housed the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo, where about 90 percent of the customers are Chinese, Yaeko Suenaga, 70, a server, said she understood why some stores might want to reject visitors from China.“I don’t think this fear comes from discrimination,” Ms. Suenaga said, “but from the true fear that humans have of getting infected with a virus that may lead to death.” Ms. Suenaga said that her restaurant would continue to welcome all customers, but that workers would wear masks.It is not always easy to discern the boundary between understandable fear and unmistakable discrimination. But some protective measures have effectively amounted to racial or ethnic profiling.At Bread Box, a banh mi restaurant in central Hoi An, a popular tourist outpost in Vietnam, the owners posted a makeshift sign outside their storefront this month reading, “We can’t service for Chinese, SORRY!” Up the coast, the Danang Riverside Hotel announced on Saturday that it would not accept any Chinese guests because of the virus.Kwong Wing Catering, a small restaurant chain in Hong Kong, announced in a Facebook post on Wednesday that it would serve only patrons speaking English or Cantonese, the city’s native language — a tongue distinct from the Mandarin spoken on the mainland. The business has been a vocal supporter of the Hong Kong democracy movement that has risen up in defiance of Beijing.Public health experts said they understood some of the impulses. “In a sense, it’s a natural reaction to try to distance yourself from a potential cause of illness, particularly when there’s no known cure,” said Karen Eggleston, director of the Asia health policy program at the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University.But examples in both mass and social media have clearly crossed a line. In Australia, The Herald Sun, a Murdoch-owned newspaper, published the words “China Virus Panda-monium” over an image of a red mask. More than 46,000 people from the resident Chinese community in Australia signed a petition that called the headline “unacceptable race discrimination.”Le Courrier Picard, a regional newspaper in northern France, caused outrage with its “Yellow Alert” headline this month. The newspaper later apologized.On Twitter in Japan, where there has long been unease about the conduct of Chinese tourists, commenters have labeled them “dirty” and “insensitive” and have called them “bioterrorists.”Disinformation is also running high. A much-viewed YouTube video in South Korea claims that a biochemical weapons facility in China leaked the coronavirus, a theory that has gained currency in other corners of the globe. In Australia, a fake post circulating on Instagram warned that shops in Sydney containing items like fortune cookies, rice and “Chinese Red Bull” were contaminated.The episodes of racism have swept up other people of Asian descent. In France, one Vietnamese woman told the newspaper Le Monde that she had been insulted by a car driver who shouted “Keep your virus, dirty Chinese!” and “You are not welcome in France” as he sped away through a puddle, splashing her.In Australia, Andy Miao, 24, an ethnic Chinese Australian who returned this month from a trip to China, said that passengers on public transport gave him odd looks if he was not wearing a face mask.“It makes people like me who are very, very Australian feel like outsiders,” Mr. Miao said. “It’s definitely invoking a lot of past racial stereotypes.”The Chinese — and Asians in general — were subjected to similar xenophobic reactions during the SARS epidemic of 2003. But now far more Chinese are traveling abroad: According to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Chinese travelers made about 150 million overseas trips in 2018, up more than 14 percent from the previous year.China’s lockdown of tens of millions of people, intended to curb the spread of the virus, may be spurring other governments to overreact, said Koichi Nakano, a political scientist at Sophia University in Tokyo.“The fact that the Chinese government itself is treating people like that would in some ways enable or encourage some of the other people or governments to take equally draconian measures,” Mr. Nakano said.Some governments are trying to ease the panic. In Toronto, politicians, a school board and some community groups have issued public appeals to avoid a repetition of the racism that swept the city in 2003, when SARS killed 44 people there.“While the virus can be traced to a province in China, we have to be cautious that this not be seen as a Chinese virus,” the school board in the York Region, a suburb with many Asian residents, said in a statement issued on Monday. “At times such as this, we must come together as Canadians and avoid any hint of xenophobia, which in this case can victimize our East Asian Chinese community.”Although Indonesia has suspended flights from Wuhan, the governor of West Sumatra, Irwan Prayitno, ignored a plea from a citizens group to reject all Chinese tourists. On Sunday, he went to the airport to welcome 174 Chinese visitors from the southwestern city of Kunming.In the Ginza shopping district of Tokyo, which is often thronged with Chinese tourists, Michiko Kubota, who runs a clothing boutique, said she hoped the Japanese government might do more to help China, such as by sending masks or other medical supplies.“Japan and China may be critical of each other sometimes, but the kindness is mutual,” Ms. Kubota said. “I hope we could do more to help eradicate fear in China as well.”",8317

Sin’s collaborative project at Junzi Kitchen shows the global reach of his home country’s cuisine. (Jenny Huang/The New York Times)Lucas Sin was recently telling a Dominican cook about hong dou sha, a red bean soup popular as a chilled Cantonese summer dessert. “Oh, yeah,” Sin recalled the cook’s saying, “habichuelas con dulce.”The Dominican Eastertime dessert, also a cold red bean soup, is spiced with cloves, while the Chinese treat is cinnamon-driven, and the Dominican version has more milk, but the dishes are unmistakable culinary cousins.It was an aha moment, unlocking for both chefs the cuisine of China’s far-flung diaspora. “We didn’t know,” Sin said, “because how often do Chinese and Dominican chefs really talk?”As far back as the ancient Silk Road and up through the diasporas of the 19th and 20th centuries, Chinese émigrés have made their homes across the world. Wherever they did, local riffs on recipes — then riffs upon riffs — were born.Consider the halal Hui dishes of Cairo, chop suey in San Francisco, egg rolls in New York, a deep-fried shumailike beef dimmy in Sydney, Big Mac baos in Toronto or sweet-and-sour fish in the Chinês clandestinos of Lisbon, Portugal. Some, such as Kazakhstan’s laghman noodles, are national staples. There are whole cuisines — Chuka in Japan or Chifa in Peru — made up of interpreted Chinese recipes, including dishes as common as ramen or lomo saltado. All are satellite culinary provinces of mainland China.Such has been the view of Sin, 27, a wunderkind chef who first opened a restaurant at 16 in an abandoned factory in Hong Kong, then ran a diner out of his dorm room at Yale. He is now the executive chef at Junzi Kitchen, a fledgling fast-casual chain serving modern Chinese food.Because that food did not exist in the Hong Kong of his youth, Sin has an unabashed love of Chinese American fare, especially at Wo Hop, an 82-year-old classic in Manhattan’s Chinatown. “It was new to me, and so exciting that it didn’t occur to me for years that Chinese food is too simple and monolithic in the U.S.,” he said.He was disturbed, then, by how easily anti-Asian sentiment and violence surged — even in places like New York — as the coronavirus pandemic shut down the planet. Strangers tossed half-filled cans of beer at him. One threw a long, fluorescent light bulb at him like a javelin.“It took me coming to New York to start really understanding what it meant to be a minority,” he said. “It’s disappointing that people who like our food and eat our food all the time are so quick to attack and deface Chinese restaurants.”To counter the parochialism of quarantine, in March Sin started Distance Dining (“a dinner series about how Chinese food connects the world”) to highlight dishes of the Chinese emigrant population — at 10.7 million, the world’s third-largest, behind Mexico’s 11.8 million and India’s 17.5 million. They call themselves sanju, which translates to “scattered living.”The pop-up meals — which are put together at Junzi from elements prepared by Sin and collaborating chefs — are available by delivery roughly once a week and accompanied by an Instagram Live session explaining their origins and interplay.China is home to some 56 officially recognized ethnic groups, and the culinary trend for Chinese food in recent years has leaned toward Imperial recipes and hyperregional cuisines — Fujianese, Hunanese, Sichuanese, Shanghainese, Uighur, Xianese, Yunnanese. But Sin’s program, by provocative contrast, has embraced the authenticity of Chinese cuisine’s globalism while avoiding “fusion,” a term that has widely curdled into a slur among gourmands.“This is confluence, not influence,” Sin said.Andrew Doro, a Chinese American food blogger intent on eating dishes from every nation in the world, without leaving New York City, favors Guyanese Chinese dishes like fried bangamary (a fish) and crispy cha chi gai.“There are so many more types of Chinese food than even most Chinese people realize,” Doro said.Sin was suddenly partnering with celebrated restaurants left and right: Malaysian lobak and buckwheat mochi with Kopitiam, Taiwanese pineapple egg tart with Spot Dessert Bar, Thai khao soi and Yunnanese paoluda with Fish Cheeks, or Vietnamese bun bo Teochew and che bap with Madame Vo. Collaborations serve up to 200 diners, and two superfans have eaten all of the 14 meals so far.As the zeitgeist shifted from pandemic panic toward rage for racial equity, inspired by the killing of George Floyd, Sin tweaked his program: Soon he was messaging with Kia Damon and Ghetto Gastro, a collective of food lovers based in the Bronx.They discussed dishes as varied as yakamein, the Afro-Chinese soup of New Orleans — which Sin made with Damon for one dinner — or what chef Eddie Huang and others call “hood Chinese” food, like the chicken wings served in many New York neighborhoods. The Chinese diaspora, it turns out, is remarkably agile.“China is this incredible beacon in food,” said Marcus Samuelsson, the Ethiopian-Swedish host of “No Passport Required,” who has made Harlem his home. “We’re relearning about heritage, culture and history. That’s not just happening in the food world but everywhere. We see it in taking down monuments, for example. We’re having a really important conversation in America and, if America is having it, very often the world is having it.”Sin’s mission is beyond gastro-diplomacy, approaching gastro-activism, using the culinary intersections as conversational starting points. Chefs are happy to join in.Damon, founder of Supper Club From Nowhere, a culinary history project inspired by civil rights chef Georgia Gilmore, cheered Sin’s request to collaborate. Amid what she called exhausting “Black for pay” propositions, designed to help brands burnish their political credentials by partnering with people of color, she called Distance Dining “a breath of fresh air.”“He’s already doing the work in himself,” she said. “There’s relief because I’m not doing this work alone. I’m not having this conversation alone.”Damon, whose mother is Gullah Geechee and father is Creole, sighed. “When we face those ugly parts of us and our distance, and we come together to reconcile with that, what does that taste like?” she said. “I want to look back and know what I was doing during the great COVID pandemic of 2020, when there was a nationwide, global movement for all Black lives. I want to know that I’m proud of what I was doing. I was cooking for a better future, cooking for a better me. When everything feels so bad, doing this feels good.”Chintan Pandya, chef at Adda Indian Canteen in Long Island City, Queens, said Distance Dining was an opportunity to showcase dishes that are authentic in a surprising way. The chile chicken he made with Sin, for example, was invented in the 1970s, when soy sauce and cornstarch were substituted for garam masala by members of the Chinese community that has flourished for decades in Kolkata.“It’s a very nostalgic dish,” Pandya said. “We’ve grown up eating it. The way we were exposed to Chinese food was this dish. What General Tso’s is to America, this dish is for India. It’s integral.”But the Chinese diaspora is not all about history or nostalgia. China is an emerging power in Africa, for example, and Pierre Thiam, chef of Teranga, in East Harlem, has noticed the nascent Chinatown of his native Dakar, the capital of Senegal.His collaboration with Sin used dawadawa (fermented locust beans) in an efo riro stew, as a nod to douchi (China’s fermented black beans), as well as fonio, a Senegalese grain, as tribute to China’s ancient, pre-rice Five Grains. They were substitutions he borrowed from his home kitchen, cooking with his fiancée, Lisa, who is Chinese-Japanese. Sin’s Eight Treasures pudding, in turn, was evocative of similar Senegalese desserts like sombi and thiakry.“When I first came to New York and wanted to cook something with dawadawa, I would go to Chinatown and get fermented beans there,” Thiam said. “The closest substitute I could get to the flavors of home would be the Chinese markets. There’s going to be a revolution in cuisine because Chinese are getting more prominent in Africa. I’m looking forward to that.”Sin’s idea, however, is not exactly new to anyone who has raved about Mei Lin’s mapo lasagna at Nightshade in Los Angeles, or the XO tartare at C.A.M. in Paris, or who remembers David Chang’s mapo ragù in 2006. And half a century ago, Chinese-Cuban restaurants sprang up across Manhattan. Chinese crossover has been on menus both divey and luxurious.Sin’s approach is emboldened and elevated by current events. After the death of Floyd, Sin knew the value of solidarity, he said, having seen it for years in Hong Kong’s own protests.Two years of collaboration at the Museum of Food and Drink, he added, taught him that “African American cooking really is the bedrock of American food culture.” The Black Lives Matter movement got him to act on that knowledge, embracing the cuisines of communities in crisis.Sin’s new education has been tumultuous. He said he now knows that Chinese restaurants have often seen historically redlined African American communities as “decent business opportunities,” which can become a potentially exploitative relationship.He is more and more angry at what he calls the white supremacy of the Anglicized renaming of “pot stickers” or “soup dumplings,” for example, in ways that are not applied to bratwurst, paella, pâté or ravioli. He has become more offended that Chinese food is “at the bottom of the price-point food chain” and more appreciative of flavors like the sweet-and-sour mumbo sauce of Chinese restaurants in Washington, D.C., because it’s “not part of the white palate.”Overall, he said, Distance Dining has amplified his creative sense of possibility — and cross-cultural optimism. His aim is to make the dinners permanent.“Many people celebrate history and tradition with food,” said Cecilia Chiang, the 99-year-old godmother of Chinese restaurants nationwide, who has eaten at the storied Chinese restaurants of Kolkata and recalled a terrible lo mein Bolognese in Rome. “This year, with the virus and everything, people say: ‘Take me back! Take me back to how it was before!’ Not so many celebrate the future now. But Lucas does.“Lucas is so ambitious. The stories he wants to tell are too long to be spoken, but perfect for being eaten.”",10579
"‘Godspell’ in 2020: Masks, Partitions and a Contactless Crucifixion",Michael Paulson,New York Times,2020-08-06,"PITTSFIELD, Mass. — And on the eighth day, Jesus wept.A hard rain thrummed on the roof of a festival tent. Nine masked performers, speechless, stared intently at center stage. NicholasEdwards, the 28-year-old actor playing the Son of God, made it midway through the “Godspell” ballad “Beautiful City” when, rising to singa lyric about rebuilding, he burst into tears.It had been a long first week, and not just because there was so much to memorize. There were the nasal swabs and the temperaturechecks and the quarantining and the face coverings. And now there were tape measures to double-check distances and translucent screensto enclose backup singers; still to come were costume pockets to stash hand sanitizer.The rehearsal halted. The keyboardist stopped playing. Edwards buried his head — pierced in one ear by a cruciform stud — under hisblack tank top.“In the real world, we would come over and hug you,” said the director, Alan Filderman. But, complying with the rules of the day, he didnot rise from his seat; nor did the other actors, who extended air hugs instead.Edwards took a moment, collected himself and finished the scene. “As I started to sing, ‘When your trust is all but shattered,’ that took meout, really hearing that,” he later explained. “We’ve lost all faith and trust in each other, and trust in the theater. Will it ever come back?”The coronavirus pandemic emptied stages across the United States in March, as local officials banned large gatherings and then thenationwide theater actors’ union barred its members from performing. Now, for the first time anywhere in the country, a handful of unionactors are returning to the stage — two stages, actually, both of them located in the Berkshires, a treasured summer cultural destination inWestern Massachusetts.The two productions here in Pittsfield — “Godspell” at Berkshire Theater Group, and the one-person play “Harry Clarke” at BarringtonStage Company — are de facto public health experiments. If they succeed, they could be a model for professional theater during thisperiod of peril. But if actors or audience members get sick, that would be a serious setback.“The whole industry needs this,” said Kate Shindle, the president of Actors’ Equity Association, the labor union representing 51,000performers and stage managers. Shindle, who planned to attend the “Godspell” opening Aug. 7, video called the musical’s actors on theirfirst day of rehearsal with a message of encouragement and of caution. “Not to put any pressure on you, but the entire American theater isdepending on you to be really smart,” she said. “People are going to look to you to know that theater can happen without anybody gettingsick.”Theater, as an art form and an industry, is facing an enormous crisis.Much of the way it has long worked — audiences packed side-by-side in confined spaces, storytelling that often involves intimacy, combatand singing — seems to make it especially conducive to viral spread. Many theaters have pivoted to streaming, and some are putting onshows with nonunion actors, but even as other elements of society gingerly reopen, there is no clear plan for how or when Broadway andthe nation’s regional theaters might do so.That means many who depend on stagecraft for a living are jobless. Employers — from big Broadway shows to tiny nonprofits — have lostrevenue and laid off employees. Workers — from actors to ushers — have lost their income and, in a growing number of cases, their healthinsurance.Equity agreed to allow the two Berkshire productions because the number of reported coronavirus cases in Western Massachusetts is lowand because the theaters agreed to implement a dizzying array of prophylactic measures for both workers and audience members. Themonthlong production of “Godspell,” with 10 roles, is the more complex undertaking because of the cast size and the perils of singing,which produces potentially dangerous aerosols.The 1971 musical remains enormously popular, with nearly 10,000 productions over the past two decades. Adapted from the Gospel ofMatthew, the show focuses on Jesus’ uses of parables as a teaching tool; it has been staged in many, many ways (at a refugee camp, in aprison, among homeless squatters), and this production — spoiler alert — is set during the pandemic. The visible onstage public healthmeasures — partitions, masks, social distancing — “become part of the parable of being a moral person,” said Matthew Adelson, the show’slighting designer.The acting company — 12 performers, including two understudies — range in age from 20 to 34. A few have Broadway experience, butmost are at earlier stages of their careers. At least three, including Edwards, have had the coronavirus.They are exuberantly grateful to be working. “I’m just so excited to perform for people again,” said Najah Hetsberger, a 20-year-oldmusical theater student at Montclair State University. “I haven’t done that for months.”There are, of course, practical benefits as well. Dan Rosales, a 30-year-old who expected to spend this summer performing in the off-Broadway musical “Trevor,” said that, without this role, he wouldn’t qualify for health insurance next year. And Emily Koch, a 29-year-oldwho has performed leading roles in “Wicked” and “Waitress,” acknowledged, “I definitely needed the money.”Over and over, they said they hoped success in Pittsfield would lead to more jobs for theater artists elsewhere. “This has to work,” saidAlex Getlin, a 26-year-old New Yorker spending her third summer at Berkshire Theater Group, “so more theater can happen in the rest ofthe country and more of my friends can get back to work. But not everyone wanted to be part of this production. “They’re bold, and someone has to do it, but I don’t know that I wanted to be theguinea pig,” said Vishal Vaidya, one of three actors who declined an opportunity to be in the show. “My joke is, ‘Do I want to die doing“Godspell”?’”On the day of the first rehearsal, under an open-air tent in Stockbridge, there were rules to be learned even before the actors openedtheir scripts: one person in a bathroom at a time; music stands 6 feet apart; individually wrapped bagels; personal bins of Sharpies,sweat rags and sanitizer.Kate Maguire, the theater’s artistic director, choked up as she offered a few words of welcome: “At this time in history, someone had tobegin to tell the stories again.”And then they began to talk. About the pandemic. About the Black Lives Matter movement. About “Godspell.”“I’ve been alone in my apartment for four months, literally,” Filderman, 65, offered as a prompt and a confession. “I’m very nervousabout my life and my future.”Stories, which Filderman would later fashion into a prelude, began to flow. Zach Williams, a 28-year-old Texan, had been touring in“Aladdin” when the pandemic hit. Tim Jones, 24, had just moved to New York; he returned home to Pittsfield and took a job deliveringmasks and gowns to nursing homes.Kimberly Immanuel, 25, reflected on injustice. “I was sick of people staring at me as if I was the human incarnation of COVID-19 justbecause I’m Asian,” she said.Edwards spoke of theater as a path through despair. “When COVID started, I thought, I’m just going to give up — I had panic attacksfor days on end,” he said. “Art saved me.”A deafening thunderstorm brought an end to that day’s rehearsal.The show is being staged in a tent pitched on a gravel-and-asphalt parking lot beside the Berkshire Theater Group’s Colonial Theater,and that’s where most of the two-week rehearsal period took place.Three mornings a week, the actors shuttled to the Berkshire Medical Center for testing. There was rarely any wait — this is a ruralregion — so they simply drove under a canopy, rolled down the car windows and braced. Some shrugged, while others screamed;Hetsberger repeatedly yelled at the top of her lungs even before the swab hit her nose, saying doing so helped her endure the probe.Each day there were complications (not just the virus but also passing motorcycles, airplanes, rainstorms and bugs) and compromises.“At first, did I imagine all these masks and all these partitions? No,” Filderman said. “But I do now, and I think it’s going to be reallygood because it makes the actors feel safe and it’s going to make the audience feel safe.”To keep the actors apart, the wide, shallow stage is subdivided into 10 “home bases,” each with a seating element of a different height:a chair, a stepladder, a beanbag. Props are limited because none can be passed from actor to actor. Pandemic humor is built into thestaging — during the vaudevillian number “All for the Best,” Jesus and Judas brandish yardsticks, rather than canes, and measure thedistance between them.The audience will be small — under Massachusetts safety standards, outdoor performance venues are allowed to admit only 100 people,including cast and crew, so the theater is expecting to sell just 75 tickets a night, at $100 each. (Ordinarily, the theater stages itsbiggest shows in a 780-seat house.)The front row will be 25 feet from the stage, in accordance with the state’s protocols for performances involving singing. (The show’smusic does not require wind or brass instruments, which are also thought to pose a risk of droplet transmission.) Audience members willhave to submit to temperature checks before entering; parties will be seated at social distances from one another; and masks will bemandatory.Among those planning to brave the restrictions: Stephen Schwartz, the show’s songwriter, best known for “Wicked.” “I’m just delightedthat live theater is finding a way back,” he said, “albeit tentatively and cautiously, but finding a way at all.”The tensest moment came on the seventh day of rehearsals. It was a hot one — 86 degrees — and the show’s choreographer, GerryMcIntyre, was teaching the actors the steps for Koch’s big number, “Bless the Lord.”Jason Weixelman, in his seventh summer as a stage manager with Berkshire Theater Group, didn’t like what he was seeing. Weixelman,40, could never have imagined that a life in the theater would involve enforcing public health protocols just devised by the state ofMassachusetts, Actors’ Equity, and the theater itself. But now he was concerned that performers at the front of the stage were at riskfrom those at the back, and he told Filderman that the partitions they had been using to separate singers next to one another mightalso be needed to separate the rowsThe cast was antsy. Filderman was frustrated. “I need to know,” growled the director, who was already deep into the first act, withbarely more than a week until the first performance. “We need this clarified.”Edwards, who is the elected liaison between the actors and their union, decided he was not going to wait for the creative team andtheater officials to brainstorm best practices. He pulled out his cellphone and called Equity’s national headquarters.The response was clear: Any time someone in the back row was singing, there would need to be a physical barrier between them andthose in the front row. And any time actors were passing within 6 feet of one another — meaning basically every time a scenechanged — they would need to wear a mask.Filderman’s original conceit, in which the actors entered the stage masked, performed the show while socially distant but withoutmasks, and then put on masks again when exiting into the offstage world, would not pass muster. “My concept for the show is gone,”he blurted out, “and life goes on.”The first several scenes, which had already been rehearsed, would now need to be “COVID-proofed” — a phrase that, interchangeablywith “Corona-proofed,” was quickly adopted by cast and crew. (Periodically, rehearsal would screech to a halt when someone yelled“COVID hold!” to raise a safety question.)There were complications for the designers, too.Hunter Kaczorowski, the costume designer, decided to tie-dye neck gaiters that could be used as face coverings during the show, easyto roll up and down without disrupting the head-mounted microphones.Adelson, the lighting designer, was in charge of limiting glare off the partitions. And Randall Parsons, the set designer, managed thepartitions themselves, rolling panels of clear vinyl that he called “spit guards.”“We’re not ecstatic about this, but we’re doing what we have to do for the prime directive, which is safety,” said Parsons, who, likemany of his colleagues, lost several jobs when the pandemic hit. “This is a new world for everyone. But I’m still like, ‘Oh my God, Ihave a show!’”Up the road, there were major complications for “Harry Clarke” as well. The play, starring Mark Dold and scheduled to open Aug. 9,was to be the first Equity-approved indoor production of the pandemic. And Barrington Stage went to great lengths to safeguard thetheater: upgrading its air conditioning system to improve air filtering and circulation, removing most of its seats to ensure socialdistancing and replacing bathroom fixtures (to make them touchless) and assistive listening devices (to make them easier to clean).But, just six days before the first performance, still lacking permission from Massachusetts to stage indoor theater, the productiondecided it had no option but to move outside.That night, much of the “Godspell” cast gathered on the porch of the large house where they were isolating — mystified by some ofthe restrictions (why could they sit on the stage floor where others had walked but not on chairs where others had sat?), frustratedwith all the changes (why didn’t they just do a concert performance?), worried that, at any point, the show could be shut down.Michael Wartella, an elder statesman among the group as a father and a 34-year-old with three Broadway credits, reminded theothers that chaos comes with theater. “There’s always stopped rehearsals with arguments and the director and choreographerscreaming at each other,” he said. “This is just a different topic.”Edwards, eating a burrito, cradling a script and eager to get back to running lines with his castmates, listened as the conversationdrifted from the legacy of AIDS to masking practices in Japan.“We’re risking our lives, but if this finishes and we don’t get sick, then whatever we’re doing is working,” he said. “Theater needs tobe saved somehow.”

Violent Year in New York and Across U.S. as Pandemic Fuels Crime Spike,Ali Watkins,New York Times,2020-12-29,"NEW YORK — The first disaster in a year of perpetual crises hit the New York Police Department in March, when the virus tore through the force, killing dozens and sickening entire detective squads. Soon, the courts ground to a halt. By June, hundreds of officers were reassigned to cover mass protests against police brutality and racism, where police and protesters sometimes clashed violently. By August, gun violence was surging. And as December drew to a close, New York's 447 homicides made 2020 the city’s bloodiest year in nearly a decade. The hobbled criminal justice system strained to contain the rise in violent crime caused by the pandemic’s societywide upheaval. “I can’t imagine a darker period,” Police Commissioner Dermot F. Shea said in a year-end briefing with reporters on Tuesday, citing the confluence of the pandemic and the protests. The year’s crime numbers give shape to 2020’s tumult: Transit crime and grand larceny, often the stealing of laptops or iPhones of straphangers, plummeted as trains emptied out. But burglaries and car thefts spiked in a hollowed-out city. And bodegas, neighborhood staples during the throes of the pandemic, saw an increase in robberies and shootings. By summer, the frustrations of shutdowns and economic collapse had burst onto the streets. Shootings had doubled, and most of them were concentrated in the areas hardest hit by the coronavirus and unemployment. The increase in violence resembles trends in many big U.S. cities, where shootings and homicides have risen even as the pandemic has driven down other crimes. “We’ve never had a year like this in policing, when you’ve had a combination of a worldwide health epidemic and a challenge to community trust,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the nonprofit Police Executive Research Forum. “That has been a combustible mixture. And the police in many ways were not prepared.” Shea said Tuesday that the department was caught flat-footed this summer when tens of thousands of protesters took to city streets after the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers. The demonstrations kicked off a national debate about policing and led many departments, including New York’s, to slice budgets and redirect funding to community programs. “There’s things that we probably should have done years and years ago,” Shea said, noting that the department had spent the months since June retraining many patrol officers and rethinking its approach to protests. Dozens of incidents were recorded of police officers brutalizing demonstrators, many of them peaceful, during protests. The state attorney general kicked off an investigation into the department’s aggressive enforcement. And earlier this month, a city watchdog chided police officials for being unprepared and out of touch with the current discourse about police brutality. Police officials in New York have pointed to gang disputes as a key driver of the violence over the summer, but several bystanders were caught in the cross hairs: a 43-year-old mother, killed by a stray bullet that went through her bedroom window in Queens; a man fatally shot on a handball court in Brooklyn; a 1-year-old boy, dead after a gunman opened fire on a cookout, also in Brooklyn. But many cases were stalled because the pandemic had forced the courts to operate virtually. Hardly any new trials were conducted, and the progress of many cases was significantly slowed. “I think we’ve struggled a little bit because of COVID, and how courts were closed, but when things start opening up, we have a lot of great work in the hopper ready to go, to really close some of the violence that we saw in 2020,” said Rodney Harrison, the Police Department’s chief of detectives.Combating street feuds has become a sort of routine for the police, particularly in the warmer months when turf battles and social media fights can lead to spikes in gun violence in certain neighborhoods. But officials and experts have said that something about the summer’s violence felt less predictable, and that made anticipating trends more difficult. “I think it’s about something more, something out there about the anxiety, and the fact that a lot of our institutions are not functioning the way they usually do,” Wexler said of the violence. “If it was just New York, I think that would be one thing. But because the crime increase in homicides is widespread, I think it says something bigger about what’s going on.” Despite the violent summer, crime numbers in the city remained well below the dark days of the 1980s and 1990s, when New York saw more than 2,000 murders a year. Homicides and shootings have plummeted in recent years, even in some of the city’s most notoriously dangerous corners. Had 2020 not been such an anomaly, officials have said, that trend might have continued. This year, as crime increased, the police solved less of it. Police Department records, for example, showed that officers solved 26.3% of serious crimes in the second quarter of the year; department figures show that 35.8% of serious crimes were solved over the same period in 2019. “I think COVID played a role earlier in the year, where we had a significant amount of people out,” Shea said, noting that in the early days of the pandemic when many officers became sick, entire teams of detectives filled in for other squads, often in unfamiliar neighborhoods. The clearance rate improved from 26.3% later in the year, he said, but still fell well short of 2019’s level. Critics of the police have questioned whether officers, chafed by the summer’s unrest and the national debate over law enforcement, began responding more slowly to calls. But some experts say much of the department’s low clearance rate is tied to difficulties caused by the pandemic — officers cannot interact as widely with the public, and most people, including criminals, are wearing masks. “It’s convenient that everyone is wearing masks now,” said Christopher Herrmann, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. “Obviously that adds to the anonymity aspect of being a criminal.” But, he added, the factors of the pandemic and the backlash against the department — budget cuts, shorter staffing and sick colleagues — had probably hurt officers’ morale. “Cops are kind of tiptoeing around. They’re not as proactive, they’re not as aggressive,” Herrmann said. “They’re not doing their job as well as they normally do.” The number of hate crimes reported to the police also decreased sharply, with complaints down about 40% in 2020 after several years of steady increases. Much of the decline can be attributed to a 47% drop in reported anti-Semitic incidents. But despite the decline, officials contended with a rise in incidents against Asian Americans that they said were linked to the pandemic. The department began tracking coronavirus-related hate crimes this year, covering incidents in which a person was targeted because of bias connected to the virus. So far, the authorities have tracked 25 virus-related crimes this year, a large number of them involving victims of Asian descent. (The department has also recorded 21 incidents as “anti-other” incidents, some of which they say may involve virus-related anti-Asian crimes.) In August, the Police Department created an anti-Asian hate crime task force to address the increase in attacks.",7392
Asian-Americans Ask: Why Not Call It Hate?,Hong Nicole; Bromwich Jonah E.,New York Times,2021-03-19,"Several recent attacks have not been charged as hate crimes, fueling protests and outrage among many Asian-Americans.On a cold evening last month, a Chinese man was walking home near Manhattan's Chinatown neighborhood when a stranger suddenly ran up behind him and plunged a knife into his back.For many Asian-Americans, the stabbing was horrifying, but not surprising. It was widely seen as just the latest example of racially targeted violence against Asians during the pandemic.But the perpetrator, a 23-year-old man from Yemen, had not said a word to the victim before the attack, investigators said. Prosecutors determined they lacked enough evidence to prove a racist motive. The attacker was charged with attempted murder, but not as a hate crime.The announcement outraged Asian-American leaders in New York City. Many of them protested outside the Manhattan district attorney's office, demanding that the stabbing be prosecuted as a hate crime. They were tired of what they saw as racist assaults being overlooked by the authorities.""Let's call it what it is,"" said Don Lee, a community activist who spoke at the rally. ""These are not random attacks. We're asking for recognition that these crimes are happening.""The rally reflected the tortured public conversation over how to confront a rise in reports of violence against Asian-Americans, who have felt increasingly vulnerable with each new attack. Many incidents have either not led to arrests or have not been charged as hate crimes, making it difficult to capture with reliable data the extent to which Asian-Americans are being targeted.That frustration erupted on a national scale this week after Robert Aaron Long, a white man, was charged with fatally shooting eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at spas in the Atlanta area on Tuesday night.Investigators said it was too early to determine a motive. After Mr. Long's arrest, he denied harboring a racial bias and told officials that he carried out the shootings as a form of vengeance for his ""sexual addiction.""The Atlanta shootings and other recent attacks have exposed difficult questions involved in proving a racist motive. Did the assaults just happen to involve Asian victims? Or did the attackers purposely single out Asians in an unspoken way that can never be presented as evidence in court?Many Asian-Americans have been left wondering how much cultural stereotypes that cast them -- especially women -- as weak or submissive targets played a role.Other incidents that clearly seemed racially motivated have not resulted in arrests. The police are still searching for a man who called an Asian-American mother the ""Chinese virus"" and spat at her child in Queens last week.As the debate over what legally qualifies as anti-Asian bias unfolds, the community is grappling with the reality that the law is simply not designed to account for many of the ways in which Asian-Americans experience racism.In New York State, to charge such attacks as hate crimes, prosecutors would need to show that the victims were targeted because of their race.But proving a racist motive can be particularly difficult with attacks against Asians, experts say. There is no widely recognized symbol of anti-Asian hate comparable to a noose or a swastika. Historically, many Asian crime victims around the country were small-business owners who were robbed, complicating the question of motive.""There's a recognizable prototype with anti-Black or anti-Semitic or anti-gay hate crime,"" said Lu-in Wang, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh. ""They're often more clear-cut.""Asian-Americans are sharply divided over the best measures to curb the violence, reflecting the wide ideological and generational differences within a group that encompasses dozens of ethnicities. There are about 1.2 million Asians in New York City, according to census data, making up 14 percent of the city's population.Some have called for lowering the bar to bring hate-crime charges, toughening penalties and boosting funding for the New York Police Department to investigate attacks against Asians.Others have opposed these proposals, saying more policing could harm their own communities, worsen racial tensions and disproportionately target the Black and Latino communities that have long dealt with aggressive policing.""I've rarely seen people who are more socially privileged be the ones accused of hate crimes,"" said Anne Oredeko, the supervising attorney with the racial justice unit at Legal Aid, a public defenders group. ""Often what you end up seeing is people of color being accused of hate crimes.""Under New York State law, certain offenses can be upgraded to hate crimes, increasing the potential prison sentence. As evidence, prosecutors often point to hateful verbal statements or social media posts by the defendant.Among large American cities, New York City had the largest increase in reported hate crimes against Asians last year, according to an analysis of police data by a center at the California State University, San Bernardino. There were 28 such incidents in 2020, up from 3 in 2019, according to New York Police Department data.In the past month alone, several assaults on Asian victims have been reported to the police, including an attack on an older woman who was pushed outside a bakery in Queens. None of the incidents has been charged as a hate crime.In fact, the only person who has been prosecuted for an anti-Asian hate crime in New York City this year is Taiwanese. He was accused of writing anti-Chinese graffiti outside several businesses in Queens.The authorities acknowledge that the data is limited and imperfect. A pending bill that is expected to pass by June would set up a more standardized system for New York's courts, police and prosecutors to report hate crime incidents.Stewart Loo, a deputy inspector who heads the Police Department's Asian Hate Crimes Task Force, said in an interview that Asian-Americans are often reluctant to report crime because of language barriers or worries over having their immigration status questioned. Many also fear retaliation from perpetrators, he said, or simply do not want to make trouble.""The process is very daunting,"" Mr. Loo said. ""You have to go to the police station, you have to talk to detectives, you have to talk to prosecutors.""Last year, the attacks in New York City that did get prosecuted as hate crimes typically involved people blaming Asians for spreading the coronavirus, echoing the rhetoric of former President Donald J. Trump, who has referred to the disease as the ""China virus"" and the ""Kung Flu.""For instance, a white woman was charged with a hate crime last March after she bumped into an Asian woman crossing the street in Manhattan and said, ""You're the reason why the coronavirus is here,"" before spitting on her and pulling out some of her hair, according to prosecutors.In the Chinatown stabbing last month, prosecutors said there was no evidence that the defendant, Salman Muflehi, targeted the victim because he was Asian or saw the victim's face before stabbing him. Mr. Muflehi did tell the police afterward that he did not like the way the victim had looked at him.Mr. Muflehi immigrated from Yemen to New York as a teenager. He has suffered from severe mental health issues for years, often getting into fights and landing in jail, according to interviews with his brother and mother. They say he has never expressed any hatred against Asians.He has previously been arrested on accusations that he assaulted both his brother and his father. Most recently, he was charged in January with punching a Hispanic man in the head, prosecutors said. (Prior news reports incorrectly identified that victim as Asian.)Mr. Muflehi remains in jail. He faces four criminal charges, including attempted murder. Adding a hate crime designation to the charge would raise the minimum sentence he faces from five years to eight years.The 36-year-old victim, whose identity has not been made public, was hospitalized for more than two weeks. He was released on Sunday.Police investigators recommended the stabbing be charged as a hate crime, but the Manhattan district attorney's office disagreed.Shirley Ng, a community organizer in Manhattan's Chinatown, supports easing the criteria for hate crime charges and eliminating bail for them, because, in her view, officials have been too lenient in cases involving Asian victims.""It's too easy to say these suspects have mental illness,"" Ms. Ng said. ""Sometimes they are also cognizant that they're out to hurt people.""Others say tougher enforcement could end up pitting Asian-Americans against Black and Latino communities, inflaming racial tensions.Wayne Ho, president of the Chinese-American Planning Council, a social services agency, said many of his Asian colleagues were verbally harassed during the pandemic but chose not to alert law enforcement because they worried the perpetrators, who were often people of color, could be mistreated by the police.""I asked myself, do I want this person in jail?"" said Alice Wong, one of Mr. Ho's colleagues. ""Just because you put someone in jail doesn't make them not hate anyone anymore.""Recognizing this challenge, some law enforcement officials have called for people who commit hate crimes to attend antiracism classes as an alternative to prison.The approach was used after four teenage girls last March assaulted a 52-year-old Asian woman on a bus in the Bronx while accusing her of spreading the coronavirus, according to prosecutors. One of the girls beat her with an umbrella.With the consent of the victim, prosecutors allowed three of the girls to be cleared of criminal charges if they participated in an educational program on hate crimes for two months. Their identities have not been made public because they are minors.Elizabeth OuYang, a civil rights lawyer who supervised the program, said the program helped debunk stereotypes for the girls, who are Black and grew up without much interaction with Asian-Americans. By the end, Ms. OuYang felt confident that they were remorseful about what they had done.""The girls are good kids,"" Ms. OuYang said. ""They're not evil monsters. I swear on my mother's grave they will not commit another hate crime again.""",10279
After Georgia Attacks Asian Americans Demand Serious Action on Bias,"Eligon John, Fuller Thomas, Cowan Jill",New York Times,2021-03-18,"Police officers mingle with demonstrators at a ‘Stop Asian Hate’ rally in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue Thursday, March 18, 2021. Amid fear, sadness, and pain, the shootings in the Atlanta area have generated anger over the country’s longstanding failure to address anti-Asian discrimination. (Ruth Fremson/The New York Times)
Video clips of disturbing attacks on the street. Insults hurled by politicians. Derogatory graffiti scrawled on businesses.
For most of the last year, Asian Americans have sounded the alarm over the rising discrimination they have experienced and witnessed fueled in part by racist language and false claims about the coronavirus by former President Donald Trump and other public officials. Celebrities, activists, and influencers on social media have implored people to stop the hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
Then came the fatal shootings in Georgia of eight people, six of them women of Asian descent.
Amid fear, sadness, and pain, the carnage has evoked another emotion among some Asian Americans: anger over the country’s long-standing failure to take discrimination against them seriously.
Some scholars and activists said Tuesday’s massacre was unsurprising after public officials and popular culture have for years downplayed the dangers of bias and stereotypes against Asians.
Although Asian Americans, like other minority groups, have endured a long history of deadly violence, the threats and discrimination they continue to face are often trivialized as harmless insults. In many cases, some said, people are reluctant to even acknowledge that attacks against Asian Americans could be racially motivated, as happened Wednesday when a law enforcement official in Georgia seemed to dismiss racial animus as a motive in the shootings.
Instead, he said the suspect, Robert Aaron Long, who is white, was having “a really bad day” and cited Long’s statement that he was driven by a sex addiction and not racial bias.
Even when anti-Asian violence is acknowledged, experts say it is sometimes casually dismissed as an isolated episode rather than a core part of the Asian American story.
“There’s a tendency to not believe that violence against Asian Americans is real,” said Angela Hsu, 52, a lawyer in suburban Atlanta. “It’s almost like you need something really, really jarring to make people believe that there is discrimination against Asian Americans.”
Without a deeper, widespread understanding of, or belief in the dangers that Asian Americans face, it’s difficult for activists to marshal a concerted national push — in law enforcement, the media, and the public — to fight anti-Asian racism, activists say.
They tend to be invisible to much of society, which only furthers a widespread dismissal of anti-Asian violence, said Chris J. Lee, 33, a founder of Plan A Magazine, an online journal focused on Asian American culture and politics.
“The types of people who get killed, like people who work at massage parlors, elderly Asians picking up cans for a living — none of us really know these people,” he said.
The marginalization of Asian Americans has deep roots.
Chinese immigrants who built railways and mined gold in the 19th century were shunted into Chinatowns in San Francisco and other cities, redlined by financial institutions and often left to fend for themselves.
Further immigration from China was restricted by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first immigration law targeting working-class immigrants from a specific country. It was followed in 1917 by the most restrictive immigration law in the nation’s history, the Asiatic Barred Zone Act, which blocked immigrants from Istanbul all the way to Jakarta and beyond, nearly eliminating all arrivals from some of the most populous areas of the planet — the South Asian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.
Japanese residents in the United States were for decades kept out of white neighborhoods through covenants written into real estate deeds; tens of thousands of American citizens of Japanese descent were incarcerated in internment camps during World War II.
When immigration laws were liberalized in the 1960s, immigrants from Asia were allowed into the U.S. in unprecedented numbers. 
Asian ethnic groups, though distinct from one another, have at times been lumped together under the umbrella of an Asian American identity. But the anti-Asian violence that has come during the pandemic seems to have solidified a greater sense of solidarity among a group that is diverse in income, religion, and culture, said Will Lex Ham, an actor who has helped lead a campaign of awareness of violence against Asians.
“As long as we share the same physical features, we are being treated the same in this country,” Ham said.
In the wake of attacks on older people in Asian neighborhoods in California, some community leaders have demanded an increased police presence. Others have said that simply adding law enforcement officers was not a solution.
Some are pushing Gov. Gavin Newsom to appoint an Asian American to be California’s attorney general.
An Asian American as the state’s top law enforcement official is needed to build trust “particularly when it comes to what have been strained relationships between law enforcement and immigrant communities and communities of color,” David Chiu, a member of the California state Assembly, said during a news conference Wednesday.
In the Atlanta area, where the Asian community has grown in recent years and become more politically influential, the murders have reignited anxieties that may have been subsiding for some people as an end to the pandemic is in sight. When the pandemic began, Hsu, the lawyer, said she almost expected that people would hurl insults at her because she is Chinese American. In recent weeks, she had let her guard down, she said.
“We’re coming out of the pandemic, there’s a new president, we’re not hearing ‘Kung Flu’ and ‘China Virus’ every other word,” she said, referring to some of the derogatory terms that Trump used for the coronavirus. “I was really lured into thinking it’s sort of safe to go outside again.” 
Now she is back on high alert.
Suraiya Sharker, a community organizer with the Atlanta chapter of the National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum, said that after the shootings, she received calls from several members of her organization who were in tears.
Sharker, 22, is particularly worried about her parents, who moved to the United States from Bangladesh when she was 4, because they are of the demographic particularly vulnerable to attacks. As first-generation immigrants, their English is not perfect. They work in a fast-food restaurant in suburban Atlanta where Sharker said a customer once threatened her father in a disagreement over the bill and customers have refused to be served by her mother because she wears a hijab.
But as much as she and other Asian Americans are more cautious now, they are also more energized, she said.
“This,” she said, “has been an awakening for a lot of folks to say ‘Enough is enough.’”A woman leaves flowers at a memorial outside of Gold Spa in Atlanta following the mass shooting there, March 17, 2021.

How Anti-Asian Activity Online Set the Stage for Real-World Violence,Davey Alba,New York Times,2021-03-19,"Protesters gather for a silent vigil in the Chinatown neighborhood of Washington on Wednesday, March 17, 2021, after eight people were shot to death at three spas in the Atlanta area on Tuesday evening. On platforms such as Telegram and 4chan, racist memes and posts about Asian-Americans have created fear and dehumanization. (Shuran Huang/The New York Times)In January, a new group popped up on the messaging app Telegram, named after an Asian slur.Hundreds of people quickly joined. Many members soon began posting caricatures of Asians with exaggerated facial features, memes of Asian people eating dog meat and images of U.S. soldiers inflicting violence during the Vietnam War.This week, after a gunman killed eight people — including six women of Asian descent — at massage parlors in and near Atlanta, the Telegram channel linked to a poll that asked, “Appalled by the recent attacks on Asians?” The top answer, with 84% of the vote, was that the violence was “justified retaliation for COVID.”The Telegram group was a sign of how anti-Asian sentiment has flared up in corners of the internet, amplifying racist and xenophobic tropes just as attacks against Asian Americans have surged. On messaging apps like Telegram and on internet forums like 4chan, anti-Asian groups and discussion threads have been increasingly active since November, especially on far-right message boards such as The Donald, researchers said.The activity follows a rise in anti-Asian misinformation last spring after the coronavirus, which first emerged in China, began spreading around the world. On Facebook and Twitter, people blamed the pandemic on China, with users posting hashtags such as #gobacktochina and #makethecommiechinesepay. Those hashtags spiked when former President Donald Trump last year called COVID-19 the “Chinese virus” and “Kung Flu.”While some of the online activity tailed off before the November election, its reemergence has helped lay the groundwork for real-world actions, researchers said. The fatal shootings in Atlanta this week, which have led to an outcry over treatment of Asian Americans even as the suspect said he was trying to cure a “sexual addiction,” were preceded by a swell of racially motivated attacks against Asian Americans in places like New York and the San Francisco Bay Area, according to the advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate.“Surges in anti-Asian rhetoric online means increased risk of real-world events targeting that group of people,” said Alex Goldenberg, an analyst at the Network Contagion Research Institute at Rutgers University, which tracks misinformation and extremism online. He added that the anti-China coronavirus misinformation — including the false narrative that the Chinese government purposely created COVID-19 as a bioweapon — had created an atmosphere of fear and invective.Anti-Asian speech online has typically not been as overt as anti-Semitic or anti-Black groups, memes and posts, researchers said. On Facebook and Twitter, posts expressing anti-Asian sentiments have often been woven into conspiracy theory groups such as QAnon and in white nationalist and pro-Trump enclaves. Goldenberg said forms of hatred against Black people and Jews have deep roots in extremism in the United States and that the anti-Asian memes and tropes have been more “opportunistically weaponized.”But that does not make the anti-Asian hate speech online less insidious. Melissa Ryan, CEO of Card Strategies, a consulting firm that researches disinformation, said the misinformation and racist speech has led to a “dehumanization” of certain groups of people and to an increased risk of violence.Negative Asian American tropes have long existed online but began increasing last March as parts of the United States went into lockdown over the coronavirus. That month, politicians including Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., and Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., used the terms “Wuhan virus” and “Chinese coronavirus” to refer to COVID-19 in their tweets.Those terms then began trending online, according to a study from the University of California, Berkeley. On the day Gosar posted his tweet, usage of the term “Chinese virus” jumped 650% on Twitter; a day later there was an 800% increase in their usage in conservative news articles, the study found.Trump also posted eight times on Twitter last March about the “Chinese virus,” causing vitriolic reactions. In the replies section of one of his posts, a Trump supporter responded, “U caused the virus,” directing the comment to an Asian Twitter user who had cited U.S. death statistics for COVID-19. The Trump fan added a slur about Asian people. In a study this week from the University of California, San Francisco, researchers who examined 700,000 tweets before and after Trump’s March 2020 posts found that people who posted the hashtag #chinesevirus were more likely to use racist hashtags, including #bateatingchinese.“There’s been a lot of discussion that ‘Chinese virus’ isn’t racist and that it can be used,” said Yulin Hswen, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco, who conducted the research. But the term, she said, has turned into “a rallying cry to be able to gather and galvanize people who have these feelings, as well as normalize racist beliefs.”Representatives for Trump, McCarthy and Gosar did not respond to requests for comment.Misinformation linking the coronavirus to anti-Asian beliefs also rose last year. Since last March, there have been nearly 8 million mentions of anti-Asian speech online, much of it falsehoods, according to Zignal Labs, a media insights firm.In one example, a Fox News article from April that went viral baselessly said that the coronavirus was created in a lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan and intentionally released. The article was liked and shared more than 1 million times on Facebook and retweeted 78,800 times on Twitter, according to data from Zignal and CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned tool for analyzing social media.By the middle of last year, the misinformation had started subsiding as election-related commentary increased. The anti-Asian sentiment ended up migrating to platforms like 4chan and Telegram, researchers said.But it still occasionally flared up, such as when Dr. Li-Meng Yan, a researcher from Hong Kong, made unproven assertions last fall that the coronavirus was a bioweapon engineered by China. In the United States, Yan became a right-wing media sensation. Her appearance on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show in September has racked up at least 8.8 million views online. In November, anti-Asian speech surged anew. That was when conspiracies about a “new world order” related to President Joe Biden’s election victory began circulating, said researchers from the Network Contagion Research Institute. Some posts that went viral painted Biden as a puppet of the Chinese Communist Party.In December, slurs about Asians and the term “Kung Flu” rose by 65% on websites and apps like Telegram, 4chan and The Donald, compared with the monthly average mentions from the previous 11 months on the same platforms, according to the Network Contagion Research Institute. The activity remained high in January and last month.During this second surge, calls for violence against Asian Americans became commonplace.“Filipinos are not Asians because Asians are smart,” read a post in a Telegram channel that depicted a dog holding a gun to its head.After the shootings in Atlanta, a doctored screenshot of what looked like a Facebook post from the suspect circulated on Facebook and Twitter this week. The post featured a miasma of conspiracies about China engaging in a COVID-19 cover-up and wild theories about how it was planning to “secure global domination for the 21st century.”Facebook and Twitter eventually ruled that the screenshot was fake and blocked it. But by then, the post had been shared and liked hundreds of times on Twitter and more than 4,000 times on Facebook. ",7975
Asian Americans Are Being Attacked. Why Are Hate Crime Charges So Rare?,"Nicole Hong, Jonah E. Bromwich",New York Times,2021-03-18,"NEW YORK — On a cold evening last month, a Chinese man was walking home near Manhattan’s Chinatown neighborhood when a stranger suddenly ran up behind him and plunged a knife into his back.For many Asian Americans, the stabbing was horrifying but not surprising. It was widely seen as just the latest example of racially targeted violence against Asians during the pandemic.But the perpetrator, a 23-year-old man from Yemen, had not said a word to the victim before the attack, investigators said. Prosecutors determined they lacked enough evidence to prove a racist motive. The attacker was charged with attempted murder but not as a hate crime.The announcement outraged Asian American leaders in New York City. Many of them protested outside the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, demanding that the stabbing be prosecuted as a hate crime. They were tired of what they saw as racist assaults being overlooked by authorities.“Let’s call it what it is,” said Don Lee, a community activist who spoke at the rally. “These are not random attacks. We’re asking for recognition that these crimes are happening.”The rally reflected the public conversation over how to confront a rise in reports of violence against Asian Americans, who have felt increasingly vulnerable with each new attack. Many incidents have either not led to arrests or have not been charged as hate crimes, making it difficult to capture with reliable data the extent to which Asian Americans are being targeted.That frustration erupted on a national scale this week after Robert Aaron Long, a white man, was charged with fatally shooting eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at spas in the Atlanta area Tuesday night.Investigators said it was too early to determine a motive. After Long’s arrest, he denied harboring a racial bias and told officials that he carried out the shootings as a form of vengeance for his “sexual addiction.”The Atlanta shootings and other recent attacks have exposed difficult questions involved in proving a racist motive. Did the assaults just happen to involve Asian victims? Or did the attackers purposely single out Asians in an unspoken way that can never be presented as evidence in court?Many Asian Americans have been left wondering how much cultural stereotypes that cast them — especially women — as weak or submissive targets played a role.Other incidents that clearly seemed racially motivated have not resulted in arrests.

To Combat Anti-Asian Attacks New Yorkers Join Neighborhood Watch Patrols,"Petri, Alexandra E.",New York Times,2021-04-10,"Main Street Patrol volunteers in Flushing Queens on March 26 2021. Alarmed and outraged by a surge in racist violence citizens band together to make city streets safer. (Stephanie Keith/The New York Times)NEW YORK - One recent Saturday afternoon Teresa Ting passed out purple medical masks - the same color as the 7 train that connects Flushing Queens to Manhattan - among a group of 14 volunteers gathered on the steps of the massive Flushing post office on Main Street. A spreadsheet on Ting's phone detailed the day's watch routes in the neighborhood. One team would monitor Main Street another would take Prince Street and 37th Avenue. A third group would patrol the blocks between Union Street and College Point Boulevard on Roosevelt Avenue where a man shoved an Asian American woman to the ground outside a bakery in February. The attack galvanized Ting to form Main Street Patrol a volunteer safety group that casts a watchful eye over downtown Flushing equipped with little more than safe intervention strategies and a walkie-talkie app on their phones. Ting an actress and Queens native works with a rotating cast of volunteers from different parts of the city and walks of life all driven by outrage at unprovoked assaults against Asian Americans and inaction by bystanders. ""This past year has taken a toll"" Ting said. ""Something needed to be done.” As it happens that Saturday was her 30th birthday her second celebration in a pandemic but her first in her new role safeguarding the community. Asian Americans are grappling with fear rage and anxiety brought on by attacks against people of Asian descent particularly older men and women. In an especially egregious episode a little more than a week ago a 65-year-old Filipino woman was brutally assaulted in broad daylight outside a luxury apartment building in midtown Manhattan. Two lobby staff members who witnessed the assault but failed to intervene have been fired. After each case Asian Americans express shock and pain but point to a long history of bigotry that has been magnified during the pandemic. Advocates also attribute the current climate to former President Donald Trump and his use of damning and inaccurate phrases like ""the China virus."" The New York Police Department has received 35 reports of anti-Asian hate crimes already this year compared with 28 in all of 2020 and only three in 2019. Officials say the data fails to paint a full picture as many incidents go unreported or are not categorized as hate crimes. As the attacks mount Asian Americans and their allies are hoping to make their streets safer. In addition to Main Street Patrol whose volunteers take weekend shifts in downtown Flushing at least three other similar groups have formed during the pandemic. A series of assaults against women in East Williamsburg Brooklyn in January led to SafeWalks NYC which offers escorts at train stations in various neighborhoods including Manhattan's Chinatown. And in February last year Karlin Chan a community activist formed the Chinatown Block Watch whose participants keep watch over an area that is the birthplace of Chinese culture in New York City. Chan who is in his mid-60s is aware of the risks he faces as he roves the neighborhood. ""With my beautiful crop of gray hair there is a target on my back"" he said. But the urgency of the moment attracted Chan who experienced racism as a child growing up in Chinatown in the early 1960s. He leads volunteers along Mott Street and Grand Street as well as the blocks under the Manhattan Bridge to check in with the neighborhood's residents and business owners. Civilian patrols have a long and mixed history in New York City. Most notable is the Guardian Angels founded in the late 1970s when economic blight helped fuel a wave of violent crime across the city. Known for their red berets and bullish presence the Guardian Angels emerged as a crime-fighting patrol on the subways acquiring a kind of hero status while simultaneously drawing the ire of politicians and transit officials for their vigilante justice. After a prolonged period of low crime in New York City the Guardian Angels have reemerged with the sharp increase that has coincided with the pandemic and they have spent time on the ground in Chinatown this past year. The group's founder Curtis Sliwa announced in March that he was running as a Republican in the city's 2021 mayoral race. But Main Street is quick to stress that it focuses on intervention rather than deterrence.""We want to remain a little more covert so we blend in more and we can actually run into catching more situations rather than suppressing them"" Ting said. The one incident the group has run into got hairy after a patroller started recording two young men who were overheard making racist remarks and threatening to harm an older man. The men became agitated and knocked the patroller's phone out of his hand eventually fleeing. The group later revised some of its protocols stressing that volunteers should record episodes only if they can do so from a safe distance. While civilian patrols do not have official approval of the Police Department they work in concert with officers by being “an extra set of eyes and ears"" said Capt. Paul J. Zangrilli in Chinatown's Fifth Precinct. Earlier this year for example when teams of pickpockets were targeting older women Chan's Chinatown Block Watch provided the police with information that ultimately led to the apprehension of both groups. ""They have added to our success in their heightened vigilance and heightened awareness out in the community"" Zangrilli said. As Main Street Patrol was winding down its Saturday tour in Flushing another group was assembling in Confucius Plaza in Manhattan. Ricky Yang stood behind a folding table with a sign that read ""Protect Chinatown"" the group he established in February as a chaperone service which got off to a slow start. Now the group was setting out on foot patrols in part to raise awareness about its services and to monitor the streets. As volunteers mobilized one older man of Asian descent stopped to ask a question not about safety measures but about the COVID-19 vaccine. Before sending teams out Yang 27 emphasized hypervigilance. Like Main Street Protect Chinatown is focused on safe intervention. ""If someone was punching me in the face I would want someone to step in"" Yang said. ""Now all anyone does is take out their phone and record."" Among those patrolling that day was Ian Tan a 24-year-old who works in commercial production. Tan has volunteered as a chaperone and also attended Protect Chinatown's first patrol the weekend before. ""I wish I didn't have to do this"" he said sounding exasperated ""but it feels like no one else will."" Tan led a team of five east along Division Street to patrol the Two Bridges neighborhood. Other groups took on the north and east side of Chinatown. ""The world shouldn't have to have initiatives like this"" Yang said adding that he hopes that one day people will again feel safe in their communities and services like Protect Chinatown's will be unnecessary. ""The whole goal is that it can be dissolved.""",7137
Asian-American Victims of Violence: [Letter],"Patricia Welch, Alice Yen",New York Times,2021-04-01,"The behavior of the onlookers was just as shocking if not more so than the outright violence of the attacker.

Re ""Filipino Woman Attacked While Others Stood By"" (front page March 31):
I am an Asian-American woman who was born and raised in the South. I have had plenty of people point at my face and remark how small my eyes are or how flat my nose is. Plenty of people who have asked me if I am good at math, know karate, eat dogs, have a ""Tiger Mom"", or whether I'd still be alive if I'd been born a girl in China.You may think these instances must have happened on the elementary school playground (they did) but they also happened in the workplace, at a college interview, and in a grocery store to name a few.While I've experienced these instances of racism, I have never before witnessed such cruelty as over the past several months. Never before have I seen someone forcibly push a 65-year-old woman down to the ground and proceed to kick her head. Never before have I seen someone go on a shooting spree and kill innocent women at work. These acts targeted Asian-Americans.I refuse to believe that such cruelty exists so widely in this country of diversity and yet I cannot help but ask myself -- why have there been so many hate crimes? Why have there been so many bystanders who assume they are only there to watch, not to report, not to intervene?Asian-Americans did not cause Covid-19. We are not here to be spat on and vilified for ""the Chinese virus."" I ask you as one person to another, please recognize that we are all humans.
Alice Yen, Raleigh N.C.I was disgusted to learn of the beating of another Asian-American, this time a 65-year-old woman in broad daylight and in full view of building staff and delivery people at an apartment building and captured on surveillance video.Three men watch the violent attack of a petite woman by a man almost twice her size. After knocking the woman down and fiercely kicking her head and chest, the attacker walked away. Just as I thought the men would go to assist, they callously shut the door to the apartment building, literally turning their backs on a helpless victim. The behavior of the onlookers was just as shocking, if not more so, than the outright violence of the attacker.
This is just another example of the xenophobia and racist behavior against Asians in the wake of Covid. Sadly, attacks against Asian-Americans are not new and reflect the racism and scapegoating of Asian-Americans in this country. The Asian-American community needs allies to stand up and stand with them against scapegoating and violence.

Watchful Volunteers Aim to Deter Hateful Attacks: [Metropolitan Desk],"Petri, Alexandra E.",New York Times,2021-04-11,"Alarmed and outraged by a surge in racist violence, citizens band together to make city streets safer.One recent Saturday afternoon, Teresa Ting passed out purple medical masks—the same color as the 7 train that connects Flushing, Queens, to Manhattan—among a group of 14 volunteers gathered on the steps of the massive Flushing post office on Main Street. A spreadsheet on Ms. Ting's phone detailed the day's watch routes in the neighborhood. One team would monitor Main Street, another would take Prince Street and 37th Avenue. A third group would patrol the blocks between Union Street and College Point Boulevard on Roosevelt Avenue, where a man violently shoved an Asian-American woman to the ground outside a bakery in February.The attack galvanized Ms. Ting to form Main Street Patrol, a volunteer safety group that casts a watchful eye over downtown Flushing equipped with little more than safe intervention strategies and a walkie-talkie app on their phones. Ms. Ting, an actress and Queens native, works with a rotating cast of volunteers from different parts of the city and walks of life, all driven by outrage at unprovoked assaults against Asian-Americans and inaction by bystanders.""This past year has taken a toll,"" Ms. Ting said. ""Something needed to be done."" As it happens, that Saturday was Ms. Ting's 30th birthday, her second celebration in a pandemic but her first in her new role safeguarding the community.Asian-Americans are grappling with fear, rage, and anxiety brought on by attacks against people of Asian descent, particularly older men and women. In an especially egregious episode a little more than a week ago, a 65-year-old Filipino woman was brutally assaulted in broad daylight outside a luxury apartment building in Midtown Manhattan. Two lobby staff members who witnessed the assault but failed to intervene have been fired. After each case, Asian-Americans express shock and pain but point to a long history of bigotry that has been magnified during the pandemic. Advocates also attribute the current climate to former President Donald J. Trump and his use of damning and inaccurate phrases like ""the China virus."" The New York Police Department has received 35 reports of anti-Asian hate crimes already this year, compared with 28 in all of 2020 and only three in 2019. Officials say the data fails to paint a full picture as many incidents go unreported or are not categorized as hate crimes. As the attacks mount, Asian-Americans and their allies are hoping to make their streets safer. In addition to Main Street Patrol, whose volunteers take weekend shifts in downtown Flushing, at least three other similar groups have formed during the pandemic. A series of assaults against women in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in January led to SafeWalks NYC, which offers escorts at train stations in various neighborhoods, including Manhattan's Chinatown.And in February last year, Karlin Chan, a community activist, formed the Chinatown Block Watch, whose participants keep watch over an area that is the birthplace of Chinese culture in New York City. Mr. Chan, who is in his mid-60s, is aware of the risks he faces as he roves the neighborhood.""With my beautiful crop of gray hair, there is a target on my back,"" he said. But the urgency of the moment attracted Mr. Chan, who experienced racism as a child growing up in Chinatown in the early 1960s. He leads volunteers along Mott Street and Grand Street, as well as the blocks under the Manhattan Bridge, to check in with the neighborhood's residents and business owners.Civilian patrols have a long and mixed history in New York City. Most notable is the Guardian Angels, founded in the late 1970s when economic blight helped fuel a wave of violent crime across the city. Known for their red berets and bullish presence, the Guardian Angels emerged as a crime-fighting patrol on the subways, acquiring a kind of hero status while simultaneously drawing the ire of politicians and transit officials for their vigilante justice.After a prolonged period of low crime in New York City, the Guardian Angels have re-emerged with the sharp increase that has coincided with the pandemic, and they have spent time on the ground in Chinatown this past year. The group's founder, Curtis Sliwa, announced in March that he was running as a Republican in the city's 2021 mayoral race. But Main Street is quick to stress that it focuses on intervention rather than deterrence. ""We want to remain a little more covert so we blend in more and we can actually run into catching more situations rather than suppressing them,"" Ms. Ting said. The one incident the group has run into got hairy after a patroller started recording two young men who were overheard making racist remarks and threatening to harm an older man. The men became agitated and knocked the patroller's phone out of his hand, eventually fleeing. The group later revised some of its protocols, stressing that volunteers should record episodes only if they can do so from a safe distance.While civilian patrols do not have official approval of the Police Department, they work in concert with officers by being ""an extra set of eyes and ears,"" said Capt. Paul J. Zangrilli, in Chinatown's Fifth Precinct.

To Combat Anti-Asian Attacks New Yorkers Join Neighborhood Watch Patrols,Alexandra E.

Asian American Artists Now Activists Push Back Against Hate,Aruna D'Souza,New York Times,2021-04-18,"From left: Tomie Arai Betty Yu and ManSee Kong founders of the Chinatown Art Brigade an activist group in New York April 8 2021. Newly spurred to action to combat bias, Asian American artists generate subway posters leverage social media and stage Zoom webinars. (Jingyu Lin/The New York Times)Early in the pandemic, word started to travel among Asian American artists: Racist attacks were on the rise. Jamie Chan told a fellow artist Kenneth Tam about getting kicked out of an Uber pool ride by the driver who noticed her sniffling. Anicka Yi, an artist based in New York, called Christine Y. Kim, a curator at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, to talk about being spit at on a Manhattan street; Kim in turn recounted being accosted in a Whole Foods parking lot.Tam decided to start recording these incidents in a Google spreadsheet he named ""We Are Not COVID."" It circulated on social media first among arts communities then to wider audiences. Over the past several months the document has filled up with reports ranging from microaggressions to outright violence.""I had assumed that things like this were going to start happening but not so quickly and not to people I knew"" Tam said in a phone interview. ""It made me realize that I needed to educate myself and perhaps other people about it.""The rise of racist attacks, some of them horrifyingly lethal, has galvanized Asian American artists around the country. They are leveraging social media to raise awareness, gathering to protest despite the pandemic precautions, making new work and — perhaps above all — finding new grounds for solidarity with one another and with other affected communities to figure out how to respond to the current climate.Recent anti-Asian sentiment may have been stoked by former President Donald Trump's xenophobic response to COVID-19, which he repeatedly called ""the Chinese virus."" But it existed long before him, since the arrival of Chinese workers in the 19th century and stubbornly persists even after his departure from office.The effects of this rhetoric have laid bare the vulnerabilities of a group that comprises 5% of the U.S. population and is breathtakingly diverse in its makeup marked by extreme disparities in income, language and culture.The murders in Atlanta, in which a young white man killed workers and others in Asian-owned massage businesses, highlighted additional complexities of gender and race: Of the eight victims, six were Asian American women, mostly of Korean descent.An exhibition titled ""Godzilla vs. the Art World: 1990-2001"" that was scheduled to open in May at the Museum of Chinese in America and a forthcoming anthology edited by curator Howie Chen about the group Godzilla, a loose affiliation of artists and curators are timely reminders that activism is not new for Asian American art workers.They have been organizing for years to increase representation, improve their visibility and forge alliances with other groups.Godzilla was founded in 1990 in New York City by Ken Chu, Bing Lee, Margo Machida and others. The group tackled problems associated with being Asian American in an art world that tended to see race only in terms of Black and white. In the wake of the 1991 Whitney Biennial it wrote to the museum's director to object to the near-absence of Asian American artists.The message had its intended effect: The 1993 biennial included work by several artists of Asian descent including Byron Kim. His ""Synecdoche"", a minimalist grid of painted panels each keyed to the precise skin tone of a friend, a neighbor or stranger, functioned as an abstract group portrait of his multicultural world.A recent series of abstract works by Kim signals an important shift: It still focuses on skin but this time that skin is bruised. Done around the time of the 2016 presidential election, the pigment-dyed canvases are less a celebration of multiculturalism than a subtle commentary on the rise of xenophobic and racist politics in the United States.Likewise today's wave of activism seems less concerned about representation – inclusion of artists in exhibitions or hiring of more Asian American museum staff – than on larger issues like the surveillance of immigrant neighborhoods, income inequality and criminalization of sex work that put their communities at risk.This change in approach recently led 19 artists involved in Godzilla to withdraw from the exhibition planned by the Museum of Chinese in America in protest of what they called the museum's ""complicit support"" of the construction of a jail in Chinatown. (The museum received a $35 million concession from the city, part of a program to invest funds in neighborhoods affected by the construction of facilities in the aftermath of Rikers Island's closure.)""The way to fight this kind of xenophobia and white supremacy is to organize and fight the root causes of structural racism and capitalism"" said artist Betty Yu, a founder of Chinatown Art Brigade (CAB).With co-founders Tomie Arai and ManSee Kong and a network of other artists and organizers, CAB has been working over the past five years to oppose the gentrification of New York's Chinatown neighborhood and the resulting mass displacement.The loss of affordable housing and the closing of garment factories employing thousands of new immigrants are not unconnected to the art world. More and more art galleries are moving into the area, driving up rents.That encroachment has driven other activist groups to focus on the art world as an epicenter for talking about anti-Asian hate. Stop DiscriminAsian (SDA), which came into being a year ago when Yi began to connect disparate Asian-centered groups and individuals working around the country, including Kim and Tam. As the group grew, the question of how to leverage their own positions in the art world became central.""It was one of the compelling things that we thought that we as arts workers could contribute to just because of the fact that so many art spaces, at least in New York and LA and even the Bay Area, were physically adjacent to Asian communities"" Tam said.Because of shutdowns, SDA's work has largely been visible on social media, Instagram above all. The organization has created multilingual graphics and downloadable posters, generated memes, commissioned short videos by artists, co-sponsored a Zoom webinar series titled ""Racism is a Public Health Issue"" and disseminated information about resources for Asian Americans facing discrimination and guidance for their allies.After the uprisings sparked by George Floyd's murder at the hands of police in Minneapolis in May, SDA called on its followers to act in solidarity with Black protesters.Its recent open letter against xenophobia and racial violence calls for the decriminalization of sex work and for alternatives to over-policing. It also asks signatories to understand the way that Asian Americans have enabled or participated (sometimes unwittingly) in white supremacy and work to dismantle it. So far, more than 1000 artists, curators and art workers have made the pledge.One of the key strategies for today's artist-activists is creating visibility: calling attention to the often unseen and unnoted presence of Asian American communities in cities and in the culture – to their labor and contributions and to the violence aimed at them.Countering invisibility is at the heart of a short film by Astria Suparak titled ""Virtually Asian."" It splices together scenes from science fiction movies in which urban landscapes are filled with stereotypical ""Asian"" signifiers, but the actual characters are almost exclusively white. She worked on it during the coronavirus lockdown.""The piece is part of a larger project examining 40 years of sci-fi films"" Suparak said ""and how white filmmakers envision a future that is inflected by Asian culture but devoid of actual Asian people.""The project emerged Suparak said ""out of an ongoing erasure and racism and violence and how both in real life and in mainstream media our varied and unique cultures are carelessly misidentified and jumbled together.""The newly appointed Public Artist in Residence Amanda Phingbodhipakkiya began to work with the New York City Commission on Human Rights in August. As soon as she was hired, Phingbodhipakkiya began devising a public art project that she would take to the subways to address the way Asian diasporic communities in the city go largely unnoticed.""The commissioner and I went for a walk in Prospect Park"" she recalled. ""I'm not sure she was looking to brainstorm that morning but I hit the ground running. I felt like there was no time to waste and our community couldn't take being invisible any longer. It was something I approached with extreme urgency.""The result of the collaboration is a public art series titled ""I Still Believe in Our City"" installed on bus shelters, subway stations and in a spectacular fashion on the side of the Barclays Center. The choice of transportation hubs was deliberate, the artist said, since so many bias attacks have occurred there. Phingbodhipakkiya has also made them freely downloadable on her website.Featuring a range of Asian Americans with captions like ""I did not make you sick"", ""We belong here"" and ""I Am Not Your Scapegoat"" they were recently featured on the cover of Time and have been showing up frequently on protest signs at rallies since the Atlanta shootings.Events over the past year have inspired some artists to begin to address themes of Asian American identities in their work. Tam who has long explored questions of masculinity in his video sculpture and photography has turned toward questions of Asian-ness. His solo exhibition ""Silent Spikes"" - a reference to the immigrant Chinese laborers who built the transcontinental American railroads is at the Queens Museum until June 23. In it, Tam connects stereotypes about the Asian male body with the image of the cowboy and its role in Westward expansion.Paul Chan is an artist newly spurred to action. His work while often overtly political has never addressed Asian issues head-on until now. (Chan's now-defunct publishing imprint Badlands Unlimited issued my book on art race and protest in 2018.) As soon as he heard about the mass shootings in Atlanta he produced a poster that reads ""Anti-Asian-Anti-Murican."" The piece is part of his ongoing ""New Proverbs"" series which parodies signs used by the Westboro Baptist Church that he characterizes as ""arguably one of the pioneering Christian hate speech groups in America.""""The murders were the boiling point for me"" Chan said. ""I couldn't let the moment go by without manifesting my feelings into form.""As artists begin standing up to anti-Asian hate, there remains the question of how useful the term ""Asian American"" is given the range of experiences it's meant to describe.""Anicka Yi has said this very clearly: 'What does it mean to be Asian American in the 21st century?"" said Margaret Liu Clinton, a curator and member of SDA who talks about the desire to develop pan-Asian conversations among the widest possible swath of art workers.""What continues to unfold is a shared awareness of how different our experiences are across gender, class, generation and immigration, and I think that's actually what is exciting about this work right now.""",11294
Anti-Asian Racism Isn't New: [Op-Ed],Qian Julie Wang,New York Times,2021-02-19,"A frightening wave of attacks has Asian communities on edge. But I experienced street harassment long before
the pandemic.One of the first English words I learned was an ethnic slur I heard whenever my parents and I walked around
the city. I was 7 years old and had just moved to Brooklyn from China. One day, eager to show off, I turned to
my father and declared, ""We are chinks now!"" in English. My father looked as if I had stabbed him. In a grave,
low voice he told me to never utter that word again.That slur has haunted me throughout my life, cutting like a knife when I least expect it. A boy on a bike once
screamed it so deep into my ear that it rang for hours afterward. The ringing eventually subsided, but the street
harassment became a regular fixture in my life.Before the pandemic, the simple act of walking to the courthouse where I work demanded exhaustive control of
my body. For a while I tried very hard to make myself look less feminine and more white. I'd pretend to be deaf
when strangers addressed me with their eyes pulled back into a slant while taunting ""Me love you long time"" or
loudly said they had ""yellow fever.""As the coronavirus spread, I began to dread my commute to work. People made a show of keeping away from
me even in crowded subway train cars. Other times, the harassment was more overt -- strangers bumped their
shoulders into me; someone jabbed me with the pointy metal end of a long umbrella while shouting, ""Go back
to China."" My parents wore hats, sunglasses and double masks whenever they left the house.The last time I took the train to work, in March, a man put his face inches away from mine and shouted ""chink""
while looking me dead in the eyes. Not one person came to my defense. The slur rang through my ears,
transporting me back to my childhood. I haven't set foot on a train or a bus since.I'm far from alone. The United States has had a surge in violence against Asian-Americans during the pandemic.
Between March and December 2020, Stop AAPI Hate, an initiative that tracks and responds to reported
incidents of violence and discrimination directed at Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, received more than
2,800 reports of incidents against Asian-Americans. Stop AAPI Hate also found that women are twice as likely as
men to report coronavirus-related harassment.Though Anti-Asian sentiment has increased during the pandemic, it is woven into the very fabric of this country.
The Page Act of 1875 effectively barred Chinese women, who were believed to spread sexual disease and to
pose a threat to white values, lives and futures, from entering the country. The Chinese Exclusion Act, which
was signed into law in 1882, was the first and only enacted legislation to prohibit immigration of all individuals
of a particular national origin. The exclusion laws weren't repealed until 1943, when Congress established an
immigration quota for China of about 105 visas per year.The country's legal framework dehumanized Asian immigrants, and in turn emboldened Americans to brutalize
us. In the Chinese Massacre of 1871, a white mob hanged nearly 20 Chinese immigrants in makeshift gallows in
Los Angeles. In 1930, hundreds of white men roamed the streets of Watsonville, Calif., terrorizing Filipino
farmworkers for days before killing a man. After Pearl Harbor, an angry nation used Japanese-Americans as a
scapegoat. After the Vietnam War, the Ku Klux Klan tried to drive Vietnamese-Americans out of Texas by burning
their houses and boats -- a symptom of anti-Vietnamese sentiment across the country.The recent spate of attacks is targeting the most vulnerable members of our community. Two assailants slapped
an 89-year-old woman in the face and set her shirt on fire in Brooklyn last fall. In January, an 84-year-old man
died after he was brutally attacked while on a morning walk in San Francisco. This week a 52-year-old woman
waiting in line outside a bakery in Flushing, Queens, was rushed to the hospital after she was violently shoved
and blacked out.Many seem intent on ignoring our pain, marking us with the broad stroke of the condescending model-minority
brush. They normalize racism against Asian-Americans, and allowed our former president to incite hatred using
racist language like ""Kung flu"" and ""China plague.""At work, my boss accused me of being ""oversensitive,"" of making things about race that aren't. I have been told
that Asian-Americans don't experience racism. I half-believed it, thinking that I was taking things too personally,
being too weak -- too ""Asian."" When I said that my former law firm needed to do more than pay lip service to
the Black Lives Matter movement, the same boss, a white man who used the term ""open kimono"" in business
meetings, dismissed the idea and declared that I, as an Asian-American, had it so much better than ""them.""As long as white supremacy is permitted to perpetuate a divide between Asian-Americans and Black and
Indigenous people and other people of color, we can make no real progress against our common oppressor: the
systems in our country that were designed to shut us all out.In 1992, my father left his job as a professor in China in pursuit of the rights and equality touted by our nation's
founders. Nearly three decades later, he hesitates each time he leaves his home. And yet, when I asked him
about it over Lunar New Year, he showed no signs of resignation, choosing to believe instead that things will get
better. As he often said to me growing up, no matter what came our way: America can be good.

A Tense Lunar New Year for the Bay Area After Attacks on Asian Americans,Jill Cowan,New York Times,2021-02-12,"The videos are graphic and shocking.In January, a local television station showed footage of a young man sprinting toward, then violently shoving to the ground, a man identified as Vicha Ratanapakdee, 84, who had been out for a morning walk in the Anza Vista neighborhood of San Francisco. He later died.Another video shows a 91-year-old man in Oakland’s Chinatown neighborhood being pushed facedown into the sidewalk cement from behind in an apparently unprovoked attack.The attacks quickly reinvigorated simmering outrage, fear and hurt over a wave of anti-Asian violence and harassment that community leaders say was spurred earlier in the pandemic by the rhetoric of former President Donald Trump, who insisted on calling the coronavirus “the China virus” or the “Kung Flu.”Carl Chan, president of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, has tallied more than 20 assaults over the past two weeks in Oakland’s Chinatown alone. Many of them were not reported, Chan said, partly because it can take hours for police to arrive at the scene.“Our seniors are afraid to walk their own streets,” Chan said.Articles and Instagram slideshows using a now-familiar palette of pastels and bold lettering have since proliferated, sounding alarms about rising anti-Asian violence with jarring statistics and calls to confront racism against Asians with the urgency that has animated wide support for the Black Lives Matter movement.The violence comes as the Chinese community Friday marks the Lunar New Year, a muted celebration after a crushing year for the banquet halls, restaurants and businesses that would normally be pulsing with holiday cheer.The pandemic has hit San Francisco’s Chinatown, America’s oldest and largest, particularly hard. The lack of tourists; the spate of violent attacks and robberies; and pandemic-related racism against Asian Americans have combined to exacerbate the economic pain felt in Chinatown.A measure of the tense and subdued Chinese New Year celebrations this year was a scene from a park in San Francisco’s Chinatown on Thursday afternoon. Will Lex Ham, a New York-based actor, was helping lead a neighborhood safety patrol, handing out whistles to residents as well as a Chinese-language pamphlet titled, “How to Report a Hate Crime.”In recent weeks, the outrage over the attacks has grown broader.In early February, not long after leaders in Oakland’s Chinatown, along with Mayor Libby Schaaf, held a news conference pleading for help after a series of recent attacks targeting Asian American seniors, actor Daniel Dae Kim retweeted the video of the attack on the 91-year-old man, saying that such crimes “have been ignored and even excused.” He and actor Daniel Wu offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.California’s Asian Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus issued a statement condemning “a surge in hate crimes targeting innocent Asian and Pacific Islander Americans,” describing it as “a national emergency.”But while researchers have said that inflammatory statements from leaders can exacerbate racist behavior, experts say it is difficult to quantify hate.Incidents of racism can take many forms — like being coughed on or spat upon, or being denied a ride-share. Tallying such incidents requires that victims tell authorities or another organization what happened, which can be difficult when they may feel ashamed or distrustful of those authorities.One statistic that has been widely cited, identifying a 1,900% increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans, appears to come from the New York City Police Department, which said that in 2019, only one anti-Asian incident was reported, compared with 20 in the first half of 2020, according to The Queens Chronicle.Stop AAPI Hate, an initiative formed in March aimed at tracking and responding to incidents of violence and discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, received more than 2,800 reports of racism and discrimination targeting Asian Americans from March 19 to Dec. 31.Of those, the vast majority, about 71%, were incidents of verbal harassment. Physical assaults made up 8.7%.Russell Jeung, chair of the Asian American Studies Department at San Francisco State University and one of the leaders of Stop AAPI Hate, said that, according to the organization’s data, people 60 and older were disproportionately targeted with physical violence, as were women.Jeung said that it was not clear whether the recent attacks in the Bay Area were racially motivated but that it was likely that older people walking alone through their neighborhoods to shop may appear vulnerable. And particularly around holidays, they may be carrying cash.“We tend to see small upticks in crime during the Lunar New Year, because people are out shopping,” Jeung said.In another widely reported incident earlier this month, a 64-year-old woman of Vietnamese descent had just left a bank with more than $1,000 in cash for the holiday when her purse was snatched.What is clear, Jeung said, is that Asian American communities are in pain. And even with new recognition from President Joe Biden — who last month signed a memorandum directing federal agencies to explore ways of combating racism and xenophobia against Asian American and Pacific Islanders in the United States — there is more work to be done.“The community is alarmed and upset, and we demand justice,” Jeung said.San Francisco is not the only area of the country seeing a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans. New York City saw a large surge in hate crimes directed at Asians in 2020 and most of the increase was directly related to the pandemic, police said.There were at least 28 hate crimes against Asians reported to the New York police, and all but four involved an assumption that the victim had the coronavirus, police said. The crimes included assault, vandalism, theft and harassment.In August, the steep rise in bias crimes against Asian people prompted the New York City Police Department to form a special task force to investigate them.“It was a huge uptick, so much so that people were starting to talk about it, and we needed to address the situation,” said Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo, the task force’s director.But in 2021, some community organizers and advocacy groups, including Stop AAPI Hate, have said Asian Americans must look beyond calling for increased police presence in neighborhoods to achieve that justice.“We recognize that policing has led to the criminalization of communities of color, and mass incarceration,” Jeung said. “Why perpetuate a system that doesn’t work?”The people arrested in both the Chinatown incident in Oakland and the fatal assault on Ratanapakdee are Black, which community organizers said has brought to the fore some anti-Black racism, particularly as outrage about the attacks has spread on social media.Lai Wa Wu, policy and alliance director for the San Francisco-based Chinese Progressive Association, said that while the influence of the former president was a new factor, the tensions among communities of color were not new and neither were the systemic inequities that perpetuate them.Younger activists have harnessed social media to raise awareness and circulate calls to action, including fundraising drives and volunteer initiatives.Eda Yu, 25, a writer and journalist who is half Chinese and half Indonesian, and her partner, Myles Thompson, a Black designer, saw news of the attacks and recognized the strong emotions they raised. The couple, she said, “wanted to come together and create a project that was rooted in solidarity.”They made an Instagram slideshow they hoped would serve as a piece of protest art and a resource for those who want to help.The first image, Yu said, was meant to look like a poster.“Please! Protect our elders,” it reads. “Support our Chinatowns. Support our communities.”The rest includes a timeline of incidents and a list of community organizations working in Asian communities in the Bay Area. They listed each organization’s website and created a GoFundMe to donate to all the organizations at once; they would split up the money, and one of their employers said they would match contributions. The initial goal was to raise $5,000. In two days, they raised $50,000.“It was crazy,” Yu said.The couple is working with the director of API Equality — Northern California to distribute the funds fairly and transparently.Esther Kim, 22, said that when she first heard that some $10,000 worth of cash, tablets and computers had been stolen from her family’s small Korean restaurant, The Crew, in San Francisco’s Sunset district, it felt as if it could have been the last in a long line of devastating blows.On top of the financial loss to the restaurant, which her family treated like a second home, irreplaceable documents — Kim’s diploma, her mother’s handwritten journals, immigration paperwork, receipts — were also gone.Her mother, a cancer survivor, had continued to cook and serve takeout though she was at risk of getting sick from the virus. Kim said her parents are not native English speakers, so navigating the applications for pandemic relief and other government programs was challenging.The break-in came amid what she said had been a spate of similar burglaries or robberies in the neighborhood. “In the Sunset, there’s a lot of Chinese grandparents that run family restaurants that take cash only,” she said.Kim said that her friends persuaded her to start a GoFundMe for the restaurant and that her family had been amazed by and thankful for the outpouring of support.While she’s troubled by the apparent rise in crimes against Asian Americans, she said her family saw the burglary as an extension of wider suffering in the pandemic.“We don’t see the burglary as a form of Asian American violence — no one got hurt; everything was replaceable,” Kim said. “But we’re in the crossfire.”",9891
A Lunar New Year of Safety Whistles Instead of Confetti Cannons,Jill Cowan,New York Times,2021-02-13,"The attacks have renewed fears over a wave of anti-Asian violence and harassment that was spurred earlier in the pandemic.The videos are graphic and shocking.In January, a local television station showed footage of a young man sprinting toward, then violently shoving to the ground, a man identified as Vicha Ratanapakdee, 84, who had been out for a morning walk in the Anza Vista neighborhood of San Francisco. He later died.Another video shows a 91-year-old man in Oakland's Chinatown neighborhood being pushed facedown into the sidewalk cement from behind in an apparently unprovoked attack.The attacks quickly reinvigorated simmering outrage, fear and hurt over a wave of anti-Asian violence and harassment that community leaders say was spurred earlier in the pandemic by the rhetoric of former President Donald J.

Senseless San Francisco Attack Explodes Asian-Americans' Anger: [National Desk],Thomas Fuller,New York Times,2021-02-28,"The fatal assault in San Francisco on a defenseless older man was the latest terrifying episode for Asian-Americans, many of whom have endured racist taunts, rants and worse during the pandemic.SAN FRANCISCO -- Weary of being cooped inside during the pandemic, Vicha Ratanapakdee was impatient for his regular morning walk. He washed his face, put on a baseball cap and face mask and told his wife he would have the coffee she had prepared for him when he returned. Then, on a brisk and misty Northern California winter morning last month, he stepped outside.About an hour later, Mr. Vicha, an 84-year-old retired auditor from Thailand, was violently slammed to the ground by a man who charged into him at full speed. It was the type of forceful body blow that might have knocked unconscious a young football player in full protective pads. For Mr. Vicha, who stood 5 feet 6 inches and weighed 113 pounds, the attack was fatal. He died of a brain hemorrhage in a San Francisco hospital two days later.Captured on a neighbor's security camera, the video of the attack was watched with horror around the world.Among Asian-Americans, many of whom have endured racist taunts, rants and worse during the coronavirus pandemic, the killing of a defenseless older man became a rallying cry.In the past year, researchers and activist groups have tallied thousands of racist incidents against Asian-Americans, a surge in hate that they link to former President Donald J. Trump repeatedly referring to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus."" Mr. Vicha's family described his killing as racially motivated, and it spurred a campaign to raise awareness by many prominent Asian-Americans, who used the online hashtags #JusticeForVicha and #StopAsianHate.""The killing of Vicha was so plain as day,"" said Will Lex Ham, a New York-based actor, who after watching the video flew from New York to San Francisco to help lead protests and safety patrols in Asian neighborhoods. ""There was no longer any way to ignore the violence that was happening to people who look like us.""Antoine Watson, a 19-year-old resident of neighboring Daly City, was arrested two days after the attack and charged with murder and elder abuse. He has pleaded not guilty but his lawyer admits that his client had an ""outburst of rage.""Chesa Boudin, the San Francisco district attorney, says Mr. Vicha's death was heinous. But he says there is no evidence to suggest it was motivated by racial animus.Still, at a time when demands for racial justice have rocked a demographically evolving nation, the killing of Mr. Vicha was notable for the galvanizing anger it brought to a diverse group that encompasses people of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, South Asian and Southeast Asian heritage. The killing of a Thai man in America has given voice to a united community under the umbrella of an Asian-American identity.In the weeks since it happened, Mr. Vicha's death has become a symbol for the vulnerability that many in the Asian-American community feel in this moment.For his family, the death has been devastating both in California and abroad. In Thailand, the killing was front-page news and described as barbaric, a life cut short in a family where siblings typically live into their late 90s, relatives say.Since his retirement in 1996 from Kasikornbank, one of Thailand's largest financial institutions, Mr. Vicha had traveled between San Francisco, where his eldest daughter lives, and Thailand, where his youngest does.For months Mr. Vicha had been pining to return to Thailand but was unable to because of the pandemic. He disliked the chilly and wet San Francisco winter and missed his favorite southern Thai dishes and his extended family and friends.His brother, Surachai Ratanapakdee, 89, now the only surviving sibling of eight children, remembered Mr. Vicha as studious and curious about the world outside the rice paddies, watermelon fields and orchards of the family farm.""Vicha was one of only a few people in the village who spoke English well,"" Mr. Surachai said.Mr. Vicha went on to study at Thammasat University in Bangkok, one of the country's most prestigious institutions.His older daughter, Monthanus, described her father as a devoted Buddhist. She remains puzzled why on the morning of the attack he left without his Buddhist amulet, a talisman of protection that he always wore around his neck.When Ms. Monthanus expressed her desire to go to graduate school two decades ago, Mr. Vicha supported her decision to enroll in business school at the University of California, Berkeley. After her graduation, when Ms. Monthanus married and decided to stay in San Francisco, Mr. Vicha and his wife came to help raise their grandchildren.At the time of the attack, Mr. Vicha was only months away from being able to return to Thailand. On Jan. 15, he received the first shot of the Moderna vaccine.""We said, 'Dad, we are going to go back soon!""' Ms. Monthanus recalled.Mr. Vicha's second shot was scheduled for Feb. 12, an appointment he would not live to make.His killing came at a time when other disturbing images and reports were emerging from across the San Francisco Bay. Three days later an attacker shoved a 91-year-old man in Oakland's Chinatown to the ground, another video that rocketed around the internet.That older victim has been wrongly described in many news accounts as Asian. Court documents give the victim's name as Gilbert Diaz, and Carl Chan, a community leader and president of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, said the victim was Latino. But Mr. Chan says he has tallied more than two dozen assaults against Asian-American victims in Chinatown, including two other people shoved by the assailant who knocked down Mr. Diaz.Crime data from the district attorney offices in San Francisco County and Alameda County, which includes Oakland, show that people of Asian descent were less likely last year to be victims of crimes than other ethnic groups. In San Francisco, where 36 percent of the population is of Asian descent, 16 percent of crime victims of known ethnicity were Asian, a similar situation to Alameda County.But leaders of the Bay Area Asian community say crime statistics are misleading because Asian-American residents, especially immigrants, often do not report assaults or robberies out of mistrust of the system or language barriers. What is incontrovertible, say leaders of the Asian-American community nationwide, is that the pandemic created a climate of fear and a feeling of insecurity from New York to California. In the past week the California Legislature approved $1.4 million in funding to track and research racist incidents against Asian-Americans.""Our seniors are afraid to walk their own streets,"" Mr. Chan said.Last year Ms. Monthanus, Mr. Vicha's daughter, was twice accosted on the street by people who told her to leave the country because, the attackers said, Asians had caused the coronavirus.Mr. Watson's lawyer, Sliman Nawabi, a public defender, said his client would not have been able to identify Mr. Vicha's ethnicity through his face mask, cap and winter clothing. Mr. Nawabi described Mr. Watson as someone who had struggled with anger.In the hours before the attack, Mr. Watson had a string of setbacks. He left his home because of a family dispute and got in a traffic accident in San Francisco at 2 a.m. He was cited by the San Francisco police for running a stop sign and reckless driving and then slept that night in his car.On that morning a number of security cameras in the area captured Mr. Watson banging a car with his hand, according to Mr. Boudin, the district attorney.""It appears that the defendant was in some sort of a temper tantrum,"" Mr. Boudin said.It was then that Mr. Vicha walked up Anzavista Avenue, a street with views of skyscrapers in the city's financial district.A witness told police officers that Mr. Watson said something to the effect of ""What are you looking at?"" A security camera located inside a neighbor's apartment captured Mr. Watson charging across the pavement toward Mr. Vicha, who briefly turned to his assailant before the impact.Two days after the attack, Ms. Monthanus and her mother went to the spot where Mr. Vicha was killed and saw that his blood still stained the pavement. They scrubbed the sidewalk with brushes and wondered why no one from the city had come to do the same.Mr. Vicha's cremated remains have been placed in two urns. Ms. Monthanus says she and her family will charter a boat under the Golden Gate Bridge and scatter some into the Pacific Ocean.""I want him to be close to me,"" she said. ""When we go to the beach we can dream that he is with us.""She plans to bring the other urn back to her father's hometown in southern Thailand, where the local Buddhist temple has a stupa that holds the family's remains. ""His brothers and sisters are there,"" Ms. Monthanus said. ""They will all be together.""The amulet, a precious family heirloom, will be passed to the next generation, Ms. Monthanus said.""He always told me that if something happened to him, this must be passed on to grandchildren,"" she said.",9113
What This Wave of Anti-Asian Violence Reveals About America,Anne Anlin Cheng,New York Times,2021-02-22,"Too often, attention to nonwhite groups is only as pressing as the injuries that they have suffered.A 23-year-old Korean woman in New York was punched in the face last March and accused of having the coronavirus. More incidents followed as the virus spread, with Asian-Americans being spat on, beaten, slashed, even attacked with chemicals.In response to pandemic-related violence like this, advocacy organizations came together to document cases of harassment and vitriol against Asian-Americans. Stop AAPI Hate received 2,800 reports in 2020, around 240 of which were physical assaults, and the AAPI Emergency Response Network has received over 3,000 reports since it started tracking Covid-specific hate incidents last year.The violence has continued into the new year. In January, in San Francisco, an 84-year-old Thai man died after being assaulted on the street; across the Bay, in Oakland’s Chinatown, a 91-year-old man was shoved to the ground. Some of these cases have made it to national news, but most haven’t. The low profile of this wave of violence is a reminder of how racial violence goes unexamined when it doesn’t fit neatly into the standard narrative of race in America.Racial violence in the United States is not simply Black and white, even if it looks that way. Instead, it can reveal layered victimizations and mediated enmity. The recent incidents of anti-Asian violence in the Bay Area, in particular, highlight this: Some Asian-Americans were outraged by the violence and demanded justice, but since the perpetrators in these cases were Black, many others felt deeply uncomfortable with contributing to the criminalization of African-Americans.I think of James Baldwin’s words: “This is the crime of which I accuse my country and my countrymen, and for which neither I nor time nor history will ever forgive them, that they have destroyed and are destroying hundreds of thousands of lives and do not know it and do not want to know it.”When it comes to Asian-American grief, do Americans want to know?These past few weeks, it seems as if Americans have opened to a kind of knowing. As I saw these recent incidents of anti-Asian violence unfold in the news, I felt a profound sense of grief. But I also experienced something akin to relief. Maybe, I thought, now people will start to respond to anti-Asian violence with the same urgency they apply to other kinds of racism.But then I started to feel a familiar queasiness in the pit of my stomach. Is this indeed what it takes? A political imagination (or, really, lack thereof) that predicates recognition on the price of visible harm?There is something wrong with the way Americans think about who deserves social justice — as though attention to nonwhite groups, their histories and conditions, is only as pressing as the injuries that they have suffered. Racial justice is often couched in arcane, moralistic terms rather than understood as an ethical given in democratic participation.It seems crazily naïve to suggest that we ought to learn, value and want to know about all of our countrymen out of respect rather than guilt. Yet while legitimizing racial and cultural differences exclusively in terms of injury may motivate reform in the short run, in the long term it feeds a politics of tribalism that erupts over and over again.Two decades ago, I wrote in my book “The Melancholy of Race” that “we are a nation at ease with grievance but not with grief.” We still are. In the desire to move past racial troubles — in our eagerness to progress — we asa nation have been more focused on quantifying injury and shoring up identity categories than doing theharder work of confronting the enduring, ineffable, at times contradictory and messier wounds of Americanracism: how being hated and hating can look the same; how the lesson of powerlessness can teach justice or,perversely, the ugly pleasures of power; how the legacy of anger, shame and guilt is complex.Unprocessed grief and unacknowledged racial dynamics continue to haunt our social relations. The discourseof racial identity has obscured the history of American racial entanglements. And why is entanglementimportant? Because the challenge of democracy is not about identifying with someone like yourself (that’seasy to do) nor about giving up your self-interest (that’s hard to ask). It’s about learning to see your self-interest as profoundly and inevitably entwined with the interests of others.But is this a lesson Americans are prepared to hear?Asian-Americans are tired of insisting that others care. The truth is that few are listening. All we can do is tocontinue to tell our truths, to know, even just for ourselves, that we are here. As the poet Rita Dove wrote,“Here, / it’s all yours, now — / but you’ll have / to take me, / too.",4786
Police cadet files complaint. Says she was called 'Cadet Covid',Randall,Others,2021-12-09,"Nan Zhang's dream to become a police officer with the Albuquerque Police Department ended when she says a pattern of harassment forced her to resign from the police academy. 
KOB reports she has filed a complaint with the Department of Workforce Solutions alleging discrimination. 
According to KOAT, the Department of Justice is also looking into her complaint and could launch its own investigation. 
""People kept telling me that you don't belong here,"" Zhang said to KOAT. ""They tell me these things every day. This is harassment. I mean, it's just because of my age, my language and my race."" 
In her complaint, she alleges abuse and discrimination and says she was given the nickname ""Cadet COVID."" 
She quotes another cadet as saying ""Because of her Chinese accent, she could get herself or one of us killed,"" according to KOB. 
""For Nan, there was no other choice to do this both on behalf of herself and all other you know Asian Americans that are in situations like this, facing discrimination,"" said Thomas Grover, who is representing Zhang. 
However, the mayor's office says two separate investigations failed to substantiate any of Zhang's claims. 
""I really want to become a police officer, honestly,"" Zhang said. ""But I don't think they will accept the people who look like me. Look different. Talk different."" ",1325
"Asian American teen attacked on Philly SEPTA train speaks out, Students march","Tamanaha, Akemi",Others,2021-12-01,"The Asian American teenager who was attacked aboard a Philly SEPTA train on November 17 is speaking out for the first time, CBS Philadelphia reports. 
Christine Lu was kicked and stomped on after she tried to help an Asian American high school freshman who was being bullied on the Broad Street Line subway while on the way home from school. 
A cellphone video shows Lu being thrown to the ground as she tries to intervene. She was then attacked by four teenagers. 
Both Lu and the student went to Central High School. Lu is an 18-year-old high school senior. 
Authorities believe that the attack may have been racially motivated. They say the attackers can be heard using racial slurs in the video. 
Hundreds of Philadelphians marched toward the City Hall on Tuesday afternoon, WHYY reports. They were chanting ""stop bullies"" and ""stop Asian hate."" 
Lu spoke outside the Municipal Services Building in Center City Tuesday afternoon. 
""Our message is loud and clear,"" Lu said, according to WHYY. ""We must all come together regardless of race, religion, or socio-economic classes, because we all want the same for our community: public safety in the City of Brotherly Love."" 
Many called on SEPTA to do more to prevent violent attacks. They also asked schools to address bullying. 
Alix Webb, a lead organizer for Asian Americans United in Philadelphia, told WHYY that the group does not believe the solution is an increased police presence. 
""We don't want solutions that are delivered at the expense of others, and that are a tool of white supremacy that perpetuate a cycle of violence and racial injustice,"" 
Webb said. 
AAU is calling for restorative justice solutions like mental health resources, counselors, bilingual services, and curriculum changes that include a focus on ethnic and cultural studies. 
Lu told CBS Philadelphia that she hopes there is a path forward for her attackers. 
""I hope that they learn from this incident, and to be a better person,"" Lu said. ""Because I know that they're just kids and they have a great future ahead."" ",2052
8 killed in 3 separate spa shootings in US,None,Others,2021-03-17,"ISLAMABAD, March 17 -- Eight people, six of whom were Asian women, were killed in shootings at three
different spas in the US state of Georgia on Tuesday, with a 21-yearold man in custody on suspicion of staging
all three attacks, police said.
The shootings came with many Asian-Americans already on edge following a recent spike in hate crimes against
the community and triggered immediate fears that Asian-run businesses may have been deliberately targeted.
Four of the victims were killed at Young's Asian Massage near Acworth, a suburb of Georgia's capital city
Atlanta, the Atlanta Journal- Constitution reported.
Captain Jay Baker of the Cherokee County sheriff's office told the paper the victims were two Asian women, a
white woman, and a white man, while a Hispanic man was wounded.
The Atlanta police department separately confirmed that four women were found dead at two business
establishments in northeast Atlanta, identified as the Gold Massage Spa and Aroma Therapy spa.
Police told the Atlanta Journal- Constitution that all four Atlanta victims were Asian women.
South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported the country's foreign ministry had confirmed that four of the
victims were of Korean descent.
Authorities have identified Robert Aaron Long as a suspect in all three shootings.
Based on the pattern of surveillance video from the shooting scenes, Atlanta police spokesman Sergeant John
Chafee told AFP: ""It is extremely likely our suspect is the same as Cherokee County's, who is in custody.
""We are working closely with them to confirm with certainty our cases are related,"" he added.
Long was taken into custody after a ""brief pursuit"" about 240 kilometres from Atlanta, according to a statement
by the Georgia Department of Safety on Facebook.
Describing the scene in northeast Atlanta, the city police department said: ""Upon arrival, officers located three

News of the shootings came just hours after the release of a report by the advocacy group, Stop AAPI Hate,
suggested a marked increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans - with women disproportionately affected.

Hate crime charges filed in attack on Asian American veteran,Randall,Others,2021-03-28,"Prosecutors in San Francisco have filed felony assault and hate crime charges in an attack on a Filipino-Chinese-Spanish veteran.
The San Francisco Chronicle reports Victor Humberto Brown is accused of using racial slurs in the attack on Ron Tuason.
According to CBS5, Tuason said the suspect used anti-Asian slurs and punched him several times before knocking him to the ground on March 13.
“When he noticed me, he got aggressive and charged across the street, ‘Go back where you came from, you caused this problem’, referring to COVID, and do you want to get hurt? You’re not a veteran, I’m a veteran,’” recalled Tuason to CBS5.
Tuason suffered a black eye, swollen cheek and memory loss following the attack.
“Because of the color of my skin, and because I like to wear a hat that says I served – that people who are minorities who are often neglected, overlooked invisible – we served,” Tuason said.
Authorities originally filed misdemeanor charges against Brown. He also faces charges connected to three separate warrants related to previous incidents, including an attack on a bus driver in Santa Clara County.

Update: Arrest made in beating of Elderly Asian man left brain dead,Randall,Others,2021-03-09,"Photo by Nancy Hung. Asian Americans have become increasingly concerned with crimes against the elderly
during the pandemic. This photo was taken at an anti-Asian hate rally in New York earlier this month.
Police in Oakland announced an arrest Tuesday in the brutal beating of a 75-year-old Asian man left brain dead,
Fox2 reported.
An assailant attacked a 75-year-old Asian man going for his daily morning stroll near Lake Merritt in Oakland,
across from San Francisco , CBS5 first reported
“That’s the guy that stays up the street, that walks every morning and every evening down the street bothering
nobody,” said neighbor Florence Williams who recognized the victim to Fox2.
“He’s elderly and he’s fragile,” said Elizabeth Seymour of Oakland. “You can see it.”
Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce President Carl Chan says he reached out to those close to the
victim’s family and says the man is brain dead.
“When I heard about this...it’s just so hurtful. I know people are saying that they’re angry. I’m not angry. I’m so
sad.”
This is just the latest in a string of attacks against elderly Asian Americans in the San Francisco Bay Area and
elsewhere in the country.
Mayor Libby Schaff Tuesday evening condemned the attack.
“This morning’s violent attack against an Asian American elder in our Adams Point neighborhood is
reprehensible,” Schaaf said. “Our police will investigate thoroughly to determine whether this was racially
motivated or a vile crime of opportunity. Every act of violence traumatizes our community, and I pray for healing
to the victim and his family.”
KCBS radio reports Oakland Police and Crime Stoppers of Oakland offered a reward of $5,000 for information
leading to an arrest in the case.
Authorities have no description of the suspect at this time.

Did suspect in Atlanta spa shooting benefit from White privilege?,"Biando, Ethan",Others,2021-03-17,"In the late afternoon hours of Tuesday, March 16, police say 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long began a mass-
shooting spree on his first of three Asian massage parlors in Georgia, according to state authorities. The man
allegedly would go on to kill 8 and wound dozens in what has been described by many as a domestic terrorist
attack and hate crime. Long, according to Sheriffs, told authorities that a ‘sex addiction’ was the reason for his
attack.
Long, who was apprehended in South Georgia, is believed by law enforcement to be responsible for all three spa
shootings that took place in the state. Authorities quickly announced that there was no immediate motive and
urged the public not to jump to immediate conclusions, however, various facts began to slowly trickle out
leading activists and many concerned citizens alike to declare the shooting a hate crime.
One user on Twitter wrote of Long “He was taken into custody alive. Because he’s White. Remember that. He
didn’t get shot, he didn’t get beaten. He got taken into custody alive. Because he’s White.” The author brought
up the concept of White privilege in police interactions, citing conversations surrounding mass shooters Dylann
Roof and Nikolas Cruz.
Users also pointed to former president Donald Trump’s referral to the COVID-19 pandemic as possible inspiration
for the shooting. The then-president used the term “China Virus” over 20 times publicly in just 14 days and
continues to double-down on the statement, having again uttered the term at CPAC 2021.
Long is the son of a Baptist preacher. The bio of an Instagram page believed to belong to him reads “Pizza,
guns, drums, music, family, and God. This pretty much sums up my life. It’s a pretty good life.” The Woodstock
native graduated from Sequoyah High School, a public school in Hickory Flat, in 2017. The man has been
described as quiet, religious, and ‘innocent seeming.’ Long has also been described as an avid hunter.
A Facebook account with Long’s name and photo has also engaged in Anti-Chinese rants on Facebook, writing
“China is engaged in a COVID coverup. They blocked our investigators from going to their lab in Wuhan and
finding out the truth about the experiments they were conducting there.” The authenticity of the account has not
been verified.
While it’s currently unclear if the targeted businesses had connections to sex trafficking, Atlanta mayor Keisha
Lance Bottoms has characterized the establishments as “legally operating businesses that have not been on our
radar,” and went on to condemn “victim blaming.”
A spokesperson for the Cherokee County Sheriff, Jay Baker, has said Long most likely acted alone in a plight to
eliminate possible temptations for sex addiction.
“These locations, he sees them as an outlet for him, something he shouldn’t be doing,” he said, adding that
Long told authorities he had an “issue with porn” and was “attempting to take out that temptation.”
Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds added that Long possibly frequented the establishments in the past and
“might have been lashing out.”
Officials say Long told investigators he was on his way to Florida, possibly plotting to target more spa
businesses.
The killings, which come in the midst of an apparent rise in hate crimes against Asian citizens in places such as
New York and San Francisco, have exacerbated race relations worldwide as well as in the Asian-American
community, with many citizens feeling persecuted and in fear of their lives.
Long is currently in custody at the Crisp County Sheriff’s Jail.

Suspect arrested in anti-Asian hate crimes in Silicon Valley,Randall,Others,2021-03-07,"Police in the Bay Area city of Mountain View near San Jose arrested a Bay Area woman Friday in connection with
two anti-Asian hate crimes, reports CBS5.
Authorities say Karen Inman told employees at a local store last month that she didn’t have to pay for food and
clothing because they were Asian.
Police believe she’s the same woman who in February screamed racial slurs and spit at two customers at a
downtown restaurant, including an Asian one.
Neither victim desired to prosecute so police released Inman after detaining her, according to the San Francisco
Chronicle.
However, prosecutors continued to investigate and eventually issued an arrest warrant for Inman on hate crime
charges.
On Friday, NBC Bay Area reports police arrested her on accusations of stealing candy and ice cream from a
Smart & Final in Mountain View that same day.
“This case is both disheartening and disturbing. Mountain View is a vibrant community in many ways thanks to
the diversity that exists here,” said Mountain View Police Chief Chris Hsiung.
Authorities booked Inman nto the Santa Clara County Jail on suspicion of petty theft, robbery and two counts of
violation of civil rights by force or threat. She is scheduled to appear in court Monday.

Andrew Yang outlines 3 steps to combat anti-Asian hate in NYC,"Ng, Shirley; Chan, Louis",Others,2021-03-06,"New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang unveiled a three-step plan to seriously address anti-Asian hate on
Friday.
Yang announced his plan after visiting with workers at Xi’an Famous Foods in Chinatown, where he says
numerous workers have been victims of hate crimes.
Yang’s plan calls for fully funding the city’s Asian Hate Crime Task force, which is now made up of 25 officers
who volunteer to be on the Task Force.
“It should not be a volunteer force,” Yang told reporters outside Xi’an Famous Foods. “I would treat it as hate
crimes which in my mind should be treated as hate crimes. There were a number of incidents early in the
pandemic which were not treated as that.”
He also vowed to reach out to communities that don’t have a positive relationship with the city officials and law
enforcement in the hopes of encouraging residents to report hate crimes which he says are severely
underreported.
“One employee told me the heartbreaking story about how he was assaulted,” said Yang. “The person followed
him out of the subway and punched him in the face after he got to the street level. He was injured and bruised
on his jaw. He was afraid to come to work for several days and then, even afterwards now, he’s afraid to ride
the subway.”
He said the final step would be to treat these crimes seriously
Yang also spent time with the owner of Xi’an Famous Foods, Jason Wang, who told him he used to operate 14
locations prior to the pandemic. Now, he only has eight. Although he’s currently allowed to serve customers
indoors at a maximum of 35 percent capacity, he elected not to due to the extra staffing costs that would
require.
Yang says his experience as a successful businessman can get the city on track.
“We have to try to get this city back on its feet as quickly as possible in terms of widespread vaccination of
everyone who needs it and then have a means of verifying people are vaccinated so we can feel safe in meeting
in office buildings, restaurants, bars and theaters,” he said.

Filipino American family says dad killed because he’s Asian,Randall,Others,2021-03-16,"Phoenix Police DepartmentThe family of a Filipino American man killed in Phoenix after being struck in the face
is a victim of an anti-Asian hate crime, reports People.
Police say 41-year-old Marcus Williams punched 71-year-old Juanito Falcon in the face for “no apparent reason.”
Falcon fell to the ground, suffered head injuries and died two days later in the hospital on February 18.
Authorities arrested Williams March 4.
Speaking out for the first time, the family of Falcon says they are still struggling to make sense of it all.
“It’s my dad who was helpless and who was not able to defend himself. It’s so devastating to think,” said
Falcon’s daughter, Malou Acunin to Fox10 News.
“Being Asian that he is, I believe he was specifically targeted,” said Lysander Lanuza to KCRG TV.
Phoenix Police, however, say the motive remains unclear and that it has no evidence the attack was racially
motivated.
“You took a very special person away from us, and he had so many more years to give and so much more love,”
said Jacklyn Lozada, Falcon’s niece. “We always felt loved by him. we always felt safe, and he always made us

Philippines/United States: Pinoys in US told to exercise caution amid attacks vs. Asians,None,Others,2021-03-01,"Filipinos in the United States are advised to exercise utmost caution as the Philippine Embassy in Washington,
D.C. expressed concern over the rise in unprovoked attacks against Asian-Americans in various parts of the US.
American news organizations have reported a surge in anti-Asian slurs and violence in cities across the US,
particularly among older people.
One of the recently reported attacks involved a Filipino, whose face was disfigured after a man slashed his face
with a box cutter while inside a subway train in New York City.
Filipinos are advised to exercise utmost caution in view of these incidents. Those who experience attacks are
advised to immediately call 911 to report incidents, the embassy said in a statement on Friday.
The embassy, nevertheless, thanked the swift action taken by a number of local authorities to apprehend
perpetrators of the attacks, labeled by many as hate crimes.
However, it called on federal, state, and local authorities to further ensure the protection of persons of Asian
descent, including Filipinos.
A coalition called Stop AAPI Hate said it received a total of 2,808 reported incidents of racism and discrimination targeting Asian-Americans across the US between Mar. 19, 2020 and Dec. 2020.
Chinese nationals made up the ethnic group most often targeted, making up 40.7 percent of incidents,
according to its report released on Feb. 9.
Asian-Americans as a whole, though, are being racially profiled and attacked. Koreans (15.1 percent);
Vietnamese (8.2 percent) and Filipinos (7.2 percent) have also faced Covid-19 discrimination in high numbers, it
said. -PNA

"United States/Iran: Report: Anti-Asian Hate Crimes Increased by Nearly 150% in 2020, Mostly in NY, LA",None,Others,2021-03-11,"An analysis of police department statistics revealed that the United States experienced a significant hike in anti-
Asian hate crimes last year across major cities.The analysis released by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San
Bernardino, this month examined hate crimes in 16 of America's largest cities. It revealed that while such
crimes in 2020 decreased overall by 7 percent, those targeting Asian people rose by nearly 150 percent, NBC
News reported.
Karthick Ramakrishnan, founder and director of demographic data and policy research nonprofit AAPI Data, told
NBC Asian America that while the uptick cannot be entirely attributed to the Donald Trump administration's
incendiary, racist rhetoric about the coronavirus, he believes Trump's wielding of the fact that the virus
originated in China and repeated elevation of the China virus rhetoric did play a part in fostering hate.
What Trump did is that he weaponized it in a way, Ramakrishnan said.
Trump's rhetoric helps set a certain narrative in place - and presidents have an outsized role in terms of shaping
narrative. They don't call it a bully pulpit for nothing, and especially Trump, the way he frequently used Twitter
as well as press conferences and off-the-cuff remarks to campaign rallies to frame the narrative in a particular
way, it likely played a role, Ramakrishnan added.
The analysis revealed a surge in cities such as New York, where anti-Asian hate crimes rose from three in 2019
to 28 in 2020, a 833 percent increase. Los Angeles and Boston also experienced notable rises, from seven to 15
and six to 14, respectively. Meanwhile, Washington, D.C., experienced a decline from six to three anti-Asian hate
crimes. Chicago remained unchanged, with two crimes each year.
Though New York accounts for a sizable portion of the increase, Ramakrishnan stated the increases in other
cities are significant.
We also know that first-generation immigrants tend to underreport acts of racial discrimination and hate crimes,
but the fact that we are talking about change data suggests a meaningful shift that likely means not just greater
reporting, but actually greater occurrence, he continued.
According to the analysis, it's likely that overall hate crimes declined due to the pandemic and a subsequent lack
of interaction in public areas and other gathering places including public transit, commercial businesses, schools
and houses of worship.
The first spike in anti-Asian hate crimes occurred in March and April last year. However, it occurred alongside a
rise in COVID-19 cases and ongoing negative associations of Asian Americans with the virus, the analysis noted.
Ramakrishnan explained that research on Trump's use of racist language in reference to other groups shows
that his language did have a profound impact on how people behave toward marginalized groups.
He noted a 2020 study that examined Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants during his presidential
campaign - when he referred to them as rapists and declared that when Mexico sends its people, they're not
sending the best - found that the inflammatory remarks emboldened certain members of the American public
and gave them license to express deeply held prejudices. Researchers dubbed this the Trump effect or
emboldening effect.
Trump's rhetoric on Latinos in 2016 actually changed people's attitudes and behavior towards Latinos,
Ramakrishnan, who worked on the study, said, adding, So they were more likely to be punitive towards Latinos
in the workplace.
A separate study revealed that the use of China virus language to refer to the coronavirus, particularly by GOP
officials and conservative outlets, has already resulted in a shift in how many people in the US perceive Asian
Americans. The significant uptick in discriminatory coronavirus speech that occurred on March 8 - the day Rep.
Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., tweeted about the Wuhan virus, which coincided with then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's
interview the day before on ""Fox and Friends"" in which he referred to the ""China virus"" - was followed by a rapid
reversal of a decadelong decline in anti-Asian bias.
Research suggests that when people see Asian Americans as being more 'foreign', they are more likely to
express hostility toward them and engage in acts of violence and discrimination, Rucker Johnson, a public policy
professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and co-author of the study, previously told NBC Asian
America.
The new report, however, compares figures from 2019 and 2020, which does not include recent graphic attacks
on Asian American elders earlier this year that have prompted significant media coverage in recent weeks. Many
outlets have attributed the attacks to rhetoric that Trump used during his tenure. But Ramakrishnan cautioned
against defaulting to a simplistic understanding of what's going on.
There's a complex variety of factors, but the fundamental reality is that there's an increase in the number of
Asian Americans who feel unsafe, he stated.
He added more data on the current situation will become available in another year, and until then, it's difficult to
definitively declare that there's been an increase in hate crimes of late. It's possible, Ramakrishnan said, that what Asian Americans were going through a year ago was just as bad or worse but failed to receive the kind
of media attention they're getting now.
He also said there's likely a confluence of factors that have contributed to the recent attacks on elders, and it
cannot be neatly summed up by solely the heightened anti-Asian sentiment witnessed throughout the
pandemic.
Ramakrishnan added there could be a combination of the effects of poverty and financial struggle as well as
opportunity at play.
Not everyone reacts to economic deprivation in the same way. And even if someone wants to do something,
they might not find the opportunity to do it. So in some ways, Asian elders seem to be softer targets than
others for this activity, he continued.
The availability of vaccines for older people, along with Lunar New Year festivities and shopping, could have
contributed to more older Asian Americans being out in the community, Ramakrishnan said. And many of the
older victims were attacked in areas that had already struggled prior to the pandemic and were hit
particularly hard by the economic impacts of the virus.
""Many of these Chinatowns are in places that are low income and also suffering economically. So that might
be one set of explanations as to why this phenomenon is taking this particular shape,"" he stated, adding, ""On
top of that, we live in an age of viral social media, and ... especially the shock value of some of these videos
increases awareness and maybe anxiety in the community."" - FNA

UA records anti-Asian discrimination: Documents 34 cases in 2020,"Lin, Peiyu",Others,2021-03-14,"A University of Arizona research team documented 34 Asian students' experiences facing discrimination during
the pandemic last year, and it wants to hear from more UA Asian students.
Five interdisciplinary UA doctoral students with diverse Asian backgrounds — Kiera Midori Coulter, Jared Joshua
Anucha Barnett, Raynimol Thomas, Sei Eun Kim and Zhenqiang Zhao — noticed the national trend of Asian
discrimination and hate crimes on the news and social media last summer. Some of them had faced
discrimination as well.
""We started to talk about what we, as social scientists, can do something for our community?"" one of the
researchers, Zhenqiang Zhao, told The Arizona Republic.
Having known each other for a long time, the five students decided to do a research project on the issue.
The purpose of the project was to learn about the experiences of Asian students, specifically East and Southeast
Asian students, at UA during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the project's consent form.
Some harassment stems from the origins of the 2019 new coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, first identified
that year in Wuhan, China.
This study sought to understand how Asian students perceived and experienced anti-Asian discrimination related to COVID-19, the potential impacts of anti-Asian discrimination on ethnic identity, and how anti-Asian
discrimination related to activism, the form said.
Student: 'He said scum bucket China boy here to take our
checks and then spat on me'
After collecting data in October and November 2020, the team presented its preliminary analysis in an online
meeting hosted by the Frances McClelland Institute for Children, Youth, and Families on March 4.
The FMI serves as a catalyst for cross-disciplinary research on children, youth and families at the University of
Arizona, according to the institute's Facebook page.
In its preliminary analysis, the team identified three types of anti-Asian discrimination that Asian students
experienced due to the pandemic: vicarious (indirect) discrimination, overt (direct) discrimination and
ambiguous discrimination, Zhao said.
In the presentation, the team provided quotes from the student participants about their experiences.
One participant said he had a couple of experiences when going to the lab, according to the presentation.
""So I have to take the public transportation and when I go pass along the bus stops. Some, some guy. I did not
look at him. He said scum bucket China boy here to take our checks and then spat on me and I'm like okay and
I just kept walking,"" the participant said, according to the presentation.
The student participants were not identified by the research team or by The Republic because they have been
targets of harassment.
""They use some profanity and they're like all the Chinese are here to kill us,"" another participant said.
The team also found physical aversions against Asian people.
A freshman at the University of Arizona experienced physical aversions when the person was in high school,
lived in Chandler, and worked in the drive-thru at a fast-food chain restaurant, according to the presentation.
""I had a customer not want to be served by me,"" the freshman said, according to the presentation. ""They want
to be served by someone else when they came to the window.""
The worker told their manager who took care of the situation by telling the customer they couldn't serve them
anymore, according to the presentation.
The team defined indirect discrimination as hearing about or seeing another person's experiences of racism via
the news media or social media, or an experience reported by family members or friends that may or may not
be witnessed by the participants, Zhao explained in the presentation.
""I have a friend who worked at a cafe and she also had a similar experience where a customer came up to her
and asked her if she was from China and my friend said yes. And he started saying, you know, you know, go
back to China and things like that. Basically blaming her for the pandemic,"" another participant said.
Another participant said they were asked ""where are you from"" more often than before the pandemic. ""But I feel
a little uncomfortable because it seems they, the person, asked me vaguely if you brought a virus from China,""
the participant said.
The team learned that Asian and Asian American students are aware of the hostile and discriminatory social contexts that have made them more cautious in their daily lives, Sei Eun Kim explained in the presentation.
Given that the study took place in Phoenix and Tucson, the research team highlighted the need for research
from Asian and Asian Americans in rural areas during these times, Kim said.
Support sought for Asian students during the in-person fall semester
The University of Arizona announced on March 9 its plans to return to majority in-person learning for the fall
semester.
Hopefully, the team members have their perspectives, voices and thoughts organized and unified at the UA,
""so that in the transition to the fall semester, Asian Americans and Asian students will feel that they have
resources and support, and that there are followers who are doing this research that can actually boost their
confidence and their sense of unity and comfort,"" Kim said.
Zhao said he hopes the college and its departments can be ready for these kinds of issues for Asian people in
the fall semester.
""Our ultimate goal or final goal is that we really want Asian Americans' and other Asian students' voices to be
heard by society or by the campus, by the college,"" Zhao said. ""And we can get the support from the
department, from the school, and from each other.""
UA Asian students (both international and domestic students) who have lived in the U.S. during the pandemic
and are willing to participate in the research can visit http://tiny.cc/asianvoice to complete the survey. Eligible
candidates will be contacted by the research team.
Universities say no
documented anti-Asian
incidents since March 2020
Police departments for Arizona State University, Northern Arizona University and University of Arizona told
The Republic that they did not have documented anti-Asian incidents or hate crimes since the start of the
pandemic in March 2020.
""I have not heard of any anti-Asian discrimination at U of A since the pandemic started,"" Sgt. Sean Shields, of
the University of Arizona Police Department, told The Republic.
The Phoenix Police Department and Maricopa County Sheriff's Office did not respond to The Republic's inquiry
about anti-Asian incidents since March 2020.
The FBI said it will use all authority granted to it by federal law to investigate and hold those who commit
violent acts accountable for their actions, FBI spokesperson Jill McCabe said.
""We want to remind everyone that any violent criminal act against any person because of their race, ethnicity
or national origin is a hate crime. This includes violence toward Asian Americans or individuals from East
Asian countries,"" McCabe said in an email to The Republic.

Teens Talk About Anti-Asian Hate,"Yau, Barbara",Others,2021-03-20,"If you are a mom to teens like me, you know that it can be quite a feat to grab their attention for more than a few minutes at a time, or even get any meaningful details about their day without it ending up being a game of 20 questions. So, when it comes to discussing more serious matters, such as the growing anti-Asian hate and violence in our communities, it may be challenging for parents to get a good sense of what they are thinking and feeling on a deeper level.
To gain better perspective, AsAmNews interviewed nine Asian American teenagers from across the country to get them to talk frankly about the surge of anti-Asian attacks, how it has personally affected them, and what they believe can be done to help stop Asian hate.
Gregory Lee, age 15
Public School Student, Menlo Park, CA.
“The anti-Asian hate attacks are quite troubling and make me question the integrity and morality of Americans. Personally, these attacks have not affected my day to day life, nor have they affected myself going outside or back to school. I do realize that I may be in a minority here, so I feel lucky. As of now, I am not afraid of being bullied or attacked because I am Asian, but I am definitely more aware and untrusting towards the public. Unfortunately, I do not think stopping Asian hate or really any type of hate is possible, as there will always be people who are unaccepting or scared of outsiders. The best we can do is bring attention to the problem and try to fix issues in our local communities in order to enact widespread change and allow Asians to feel safe. I find it frustrating that people always find scapegoats for their problems instead of facing their issues head-on. The adults of this world should not act like young children who have a simplistic and childish vendetta against people who haven’t done anything directly to them.”
Justine Schulke, age 15 
Private School Student, New York City
“People may think that Anti-Asian violence started because of the coronavirus — since it originated in China — but racism against Asians Americans has existed in our country for years. Though I’ve never experienced anti-Asian racism directly, I’ve consumed the recent attacks through the media and from my family’s experiences. The rise of the Black Lives Matter movement shed light on how systematic racism exists, and has always existed, in our country. I’m not surprised to know something like hate crimes are now skyrocketing against the Asian community, but it’s frustrating to see how so many people continue to be so ignorant and heinous, hating and abusing our elders for something they haven’t done. There are notions that Asians aren’t truly American. Asians are associated with exoticity, which makes Asians seem foreign. The news of these attacks have not had a significant effect on my day to day life, but I now carry a keychain with an alarm just in case, and I’m not allowed to take the subway. I feel extremely safe at school. My school has been implementing many conversations on race, racism and what we need to do as a school and community to be anti-racist. Our summer reading homework of 2020 was to read Stamped: Racism, Anti Racism, and You: A Remix of the National Book Award-winning Stamped from the Beginning by Ibram X. Kendi. However, in public, there is a subconscious thought in the back of my head whether I might be the next Asian American involved in a hate crime. I think the first step to stopping the hate is to acknowledge that there are hate crimes happening against the Asian community. Secondly, we need to address this issue to the school, or if you’re uncomfortable, to spread awareness on social media and to your friends. Further, we should talk about these violent attacks within the school community, at a workplace, or wherever you are to denounce anti-Asian racism. Finally, we need to get involved, whether that be attending protests, handing out fliers, supporting Asian owned businesses, reporting hate crimes, condemning hate, and combating the prejudice and bigotry of the connection between Asians and Covid-19.”
Megan Kwan, age 16 years old
Public School Student, Framingham, M.A.
“I’m absolutely disgusted by recent attacks on Asian Americans. Why is it that murder needs to occur before the world recognizes the discrimination against Asians every day? I hate how people are excusing their actions with trivial excuses. I hate how people are just now trying to stop the hate. Although support is always welcome, it should not have had to take death to finally get the media’s attention and for people to realize just how normalized these attacks are. I fear for the safety of my family and others. I should not be scared that my grandmother might get beaten every time she goes to Chinatown, or that my sister will be called racist names when she goes back to school. Fear is just the beginning of it. It also affects me due to the media attention it’s received recently. Everywhere I see people arguing online because someone is so uneducated that they believe it is called the ‘Chinese virus’ because it’s from China. I want people to stand up for Asians because they recognize that we are being harassed and assaulted. I want them to realize that asking if someone has eaten a dog before is just as racist and harmful as the attacks you see on the news. I am scared of what would happen at school. Although I’ve never experienced bullying before, I’m deathly afraid of the harassment I might receive if I go back. Before Corona, there were multiple instances of racism at my school, and I fully believe that it would increase. Such as people only grouping me with Asians because we’re the same, people telling me I have small eyes, people mocking my food, asking if I eat dogs, etc. I’m not very strong or athletic, so If I was attacked I would have no way of defending myself which is incredibly scary considering I walked home from school alone each day last year. I believe that we need to teach the next generation that any type of racism is offensive and should not be normalized. I’ve had many experiences that most minorities can relate to, not just Asians. Most notably bringing a school lunch, in which one brings a school lunch of food usually from their culture. That’s when all the other kids gather around to stare and criticize the way it smells or looks. Almost every minority I’ve met has experienced this, and it should be stopped. Just because it doesn’t look ‘American’ doesn’t mean it isn’t normal in any way. Another thing that needs to change is stereotypes. Not all Asians are smart, good at math, play the violin, grow up to be a doctor, or are bad drivers. We’ve achieved the status of ‘good’ minorities who don’t cause trouble and are smart reliable citizens. In Washington, they even changed our status from a minority to White. I am not Caucasian so do not compare me to one as if it were a compliment. Being Asian is part of my identity and by you taking that away from me is racism in its greatest form.”

“I know about all of the Asian hate crimes that have been going around, and I know for a fact that it’s serious and hurtful to many. I unfortunately have experienced Asian hate. This was before the whole lockdown thing. My teachers were wiping down all of our desks, and a boy shouted in the class something along the lines of ‘You should clean Olivia because she’s Asian so she has corona.’ Sometimes, I do feel afraid if I get bullied at school as an Asian. I know it could help if people are educated about what Asian hate is about and how it affects people. Or people need to learn how not to be a jerk.”

“I have heard of the attacks going on for Asian hate. This is a problem that has to be stopped. Similar to attacks on African American people, this is a big problem and doesn’t reflect well for the U.S, especially when we are the ‘Land of the Free.’ It’s not just bad for Asian Americans, but also for the entire United States because it impacts what other people think of our country. The attacks have not affected my life a lot. I live in a small town, so I know a lot of people in my town. I don’t get afraid of being bullied, because my school has generally been accepting, and I know I have friends that would stand with me. I also don’t go outside of my town a lot because of Covid. Educating can help stop Asian hate, as well as hate for other minorities and groups. Though it is nearly impossible for everybody to be anti-racist, we can help some people not be racist by educating them about racism. Just like people say we should learn about WWII or any other historical event to not repeat our mistakes, if we learn about racism, we can help not repeat mistakes in our society.”

“I am aware of the growing violence against Asian Americans, and I feel so disheartened that this is what’s happening in our country. It feels as if there are so many divisions separating people in a nation that is supposed to be united. During a pandemic where so many have been suffering all over the world for a year now, Asians have been wrongly scapegoated, and as a result, innocent people are being attacked, especially the elderly. Fortunately, I have not encountered firsthand any verbal or physical assaults due to my race at school or around the neighborhood. However, there are people I know who do not know the extent of their words and make jokes at the expense of others, repeating phrases like ‘the Chinese virus’ or ‘Kung Flu.’ Not only does this rhetoric harm victims’ mental health, but it also leads to more serious issues when it turns out that those words weren’t just joking. It is understandable that people have feelings of frustration and fear, but it is unacceptable when they choose to take them out on Asian Americans. My entire family is also passionate about this lingering issue. My parents have gotten stares and have been yelled at while shopping or taking a walk, and one of my brothers was on the receiving end of a terrible verbal assault while working in a grocery store over the summer. I have not been restricted in going out, but I am on high alert to watch for my surroundings. I feel safe in my school because the faculty promotes inclusion, fosters conversations, and is not afraid of educating us on current social and political issues. I am not afraid for myself, but more for my own grandparents since the majority of attacks have targeted the elderly. If we want change, we must continue to speak out because these attacks are not stopping anytime soon. We have a responsibility to not stay silent in order to educate our fellow Americans on the strength of their words and the power of their actions. If we do our part, more and more people will become aware of our situation and begin to actively learn about the ongoing virus of racism.”

“Ever since COVID started, I had already noticed the uptick in hate crimes against Asian Americans and how they mostly went unnoticed with the news barely covering these attacks. It made me terrified to go outside for a walk or to get groceries with my family being fully aware that I could easily get caught up in one of those events. The growing news and coverage over the last year of these attacks has made me pretty self-conscious about every little thing I do. Every time I’m out somewhere public or in school, I feel like I’m being judged every step I take, and it’s agonizing. Before I went back to school, I do specifically remember talking to my mom about how I was scared that someone was going to bully me at school or say something passive-aggressive and that in the end I wouldn’t know how to react. I still feel that way. Whenever someone is whispering to someone else or staring at me in public or at school, I think the worst. I think that they’re making a snide remark about my race and it makes me anxious. In my opinion, I know it’s impossible to completely stop racism, but we can start by not blaming a single race for everything that’s going on now. It’s just not right.”
Alexis Quan, age 18

“I am aware of the anti-Asian attacks that have been going on the news more recently and when COVID-19 first struck. I do not like seeing the acts of violence and hearing of the verbal tirades someone says against the Asian community. It makes me feel disturbed that people are going out of their way to harm others simply of the color of their skin. It makes me feel unsafe. I’d rather not have to go outside and deal with someone yelling at me for ‘carrying the virus’ when I have my mask on and they do not. I am not afraid of being bullied at school. I have a good support system of friends there who I know will stand up for me. In the beginning of the pandemic, I was afraid that some people would do the classic ‘Go back to China!’ — despite the fact I have never left this continent — and make racist comments about me. Now, when I am out in public, I am just wary of others. If someone looks tense or they keep staring at me, I leave and walk away. I do not want to anger them and drive them to violence. To stop the spread of Asian hate, I would stop or prevent news outlets/sources, as well as people with political power, from saying degrading and derogatory language against Asian Americans. I feel that ex-President Donald Trump made situations worse by pinning the blame on China for not being able to contain the virus. He called it the ‘Chinese Virus,’ furthering his followers’ dislike against China. It seems that some people took this response as an ‘OK’ to use hate speech and even commit hate crimes. I would tell people to check their news sources. Is what they are getting actually verified and reliable information? To lessen people’s fears, don’t give into the hate. Just because someone is of Chinese or Asian descent, does not mean they automatically have the virus; that is not how this virus works. Do not be afraid as long as you are wearing a mask and are performing safe behaviors when outside. I would also tell people and educate them using social media posts. Teens are more reachable when facts are in short, colorful blurbs. They can then repost the article on their social media accounts.”

“I am aware of the anti-Asian hate attacks and the incitement that is occurring in America today. The constant cycle of violence is disgusting. I am lucky to live where these attacks do not affect my daily life much, at least not to the extent of others. It has not changed going back to school in person. The attacks have definitely impacted my family, but luckily not our day to day life, and we are still able to do much of the things we used to. I’m not afraid of being bullied for being Asian, but it is definitely present. People need to change their biases and think about the situation in another’s shoes. The attacks are a result of the lack of compassion, education, misinformation, coupled with a plethora of other reasons, and we should tackle the issue head on instead of pushing it to the side.”

6 of the 8 people killed in the Atlanta-area massage-parlor shootings were Asian women,"Porter, Tom",Others,2021-03-17,"• Six of the eight people shot dead Tuesday in and near Atlanta were Asian women, authorities say.
• As of early Wednesday, none had been named, but some details were available.
• A 21-year-old white man, Aaron Robert Long, has been arrested over the killings.
* See more stories on Insider's business page.
Most of the people shot dead in massage parlors in and near Atlanta on Tuesday were Asian women.
Law enforcement said that six of the eight victims fit that category. The other two killed were a white woman and a white man.
The killings took place at three businesses in two locations, authorities said. The first was at Young's Asian Massage Parlor in Cherokee County, just outside Atlanta.
Four people were killed there, according to the sheriff's department: two Asian women and the two white victims.
Later, the police were called to Gold Spa in Atlanta, about 30 miles away. The Atlanta Police Department said it found three women shot dead there and a fourth at
Aromatherapy Spa just across the road.
None of the women have been named. According to CNN, authorities are withholding the identities while they inform the victims' next of kin.
According to local Korean-language outlet Atlanta K, the women killed in the Gold Spa were of Korean descent, with one victim in her mid-50s and another in her
mid-70s.
Foreign-ministry officials in South Korea said they had confirmed that four of the women were of Korean descent and were investigating to see whether other victims
were as well.
Robert Aaron Long, 21, has been named by the Atlanta police as the suspect in all eight killings. He was arrested after a car chase south of Atlanta in Crisp County,
some 150 miles away.
-Stop AAPI Hate (@StopAAPIHate) March 17, 2021
Parts of the strip where the last shootings took place are known as Atlanta's red-light district, according to local reports.
No motive for the shootings has been established, but they come amid a spike in attacks on Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.
A recent study found that reports of hate crimes against Asian Americans increased 150% during the pandemic, while 7% fewer hate crimes overall were reported
during that time.
President Joe Biden addressed the surge in a televised address Friday, calling it ""un-American"" and saying ""it must stop.""
In a statement posted on Twitter, the Stop AAPI Hate group, formed to combat the surge in hate crimes, described the killings as an ""unspeakable tragedy.""
""The reported shootings of Asian American women on Tuesday in Atlanta is an unspeakable tragedy - for the families of the victims first and foremost, but also for the
AAPI community - which has been reeling from high levels of racial discrimination,"" said the statements.

Canada: Advocates Say Anti-Asian Racism Reaches 'Crisis Point' in Canada,None,Others,2021-03-25,"Anti-Asian racism has reached a crisis point in Canada, community advocates and human rights experts said on Tuesday, as a new report detailed over 1,100 hate incidents targeting members of Asian-Canadian communities over the past year.
The government-funded report found that 1,150 racist incidents were submitted to Chinese-Canadian community and advocacy groups across the country between March 10 last year and the end of February 2021, Al-Jazeera reported.
The incidents, the majority of which were reported via online portals by individuals who experienced or witnessed them, included verbal harassment (73 percent), physical assault or unwanted physical contact (11 percent), and being coughed on or spat on (10 percent).
Forty-four percent of the incidents were in the province of British Columbia, on Canada's West coast, while 40 percent were in Ontario, the country's most populous province. Asian-Canadian women were targeted in about 60 percent of all incidents.
As Asian Canadians, our lives have been taken over by a constant sense of paralysing fear, said Avvy Go, clinic director of the Chinese & Southeast Asian Legal Clinic in Toronto, during a news briefing to unveil the report's findings.
Asian-Canadian women like myself face an even greater risk of attack and regardless of whether we're a newcomer or fifth-generation Canadian, our sense of security has been shattered, she said.
Slash by slash, wound by wound, each one of these incidents takes away from all Asian Canadians our sense of safety, robs us of our basic dignity, and ultimately undermines our sense of belonging in a country that we have every right to call home, she added.
Asian Canadians had warned in early February 2020, when Canada had recorded only three cases of the coronavirus, that xenophobia was mounting, bringing back painful memories of what happened during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the early 2000s.
Tuesday's report comes one week after a gunman opened fire at three separate spas near the United States city of Atlanta, killing eight people. Six of the victims were Asian women.
Asian community leaders have pointed to statements by right-wing leaders blaming China for the COVID-19 pandemic, such as former US President Donald Trump's use of the terms Chinese virus and kung flu, for the recent uptick in hate incidents.
They have also said decades of anti-Asian racism, misogyny and stereotypes against Asian women played a role in the violence.
Anti-Asian hate crimes reported to police in 16 of the largest US cities increased by 145 percent in 2020, according to preliminary data released on Sunday by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.
Another report by the Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center documented 3,795 hate incidents aimed at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders between March 19, 2020 and February 28 of this year. Asian Americans have been shoved to the ground, assaulted, verbally harassed, shunned, and had their businesses vandalised in cities across the country, local media have reported.
Americans of all types experience this perception of being 'forever foreigners' in a wide range of ways, Pawan Dhingra, professor of sociology and American studies at Amherst College, said in a recent article in The Conversation.
Regardless of whether some or all - or none - of these latest assaults on Asian Americans are proved to be hate crimes or not, race plays a historic role, Dhingra added.
But the US is not the only country to see a surge in anti-Asian hate during the pandemic - and the Atlanta attack has put a spotlight on rising anti-Asian hate incidents around the world over the past year.
More than 220 hate crimes against East Asians in the United Kingdom were reported to police between June and September 2020, a 96 percent jump compared to the same period in 2019, according to London metropolitan police data. In a November survey, Australian National University found that 84.5 percent of Asian Australians had experienced at least one instance of discrimination between January and October 2020.
Racism and physical attacks on Asians and people of Asian descent have spread with the COVID-19 pandemic, and government leaders need to act decisively to address the trend, John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said in May.
Marie-Claude Landry, chief commissioner at the Canadian Human Rights Commission, an independent human rights watchdog, said on Tuesday that the report on anti-Asian hate incidents in Canada is a chilling reminder that racism, hatred and intolerance have no borders.
Over the past year we have seen that disturbing rates in anti-Asian hate and COVID-driven racism. My hope is that today's report and the powerful data it presents can be used as a tool to confirm and confront this growing problem in Canada. It is at a crisis point, she said.
Meanwhile, Asian-Canadian groups are calling for concrete action from all levels of government to address the problem.
Tuesday's report calls for more funding and other resources to allow community groups to provide anti-racism education, as well as bolster culturally-sensitive support services for victims of hate incidents.
The report also says particular focus must be paid to Asian Canadians who have been deemed essential workers during the pandemic, which puts them at increased risk of attacks - and ensuring that they have adequate workplace protections in place.
Our sisters in Atlanta... were violently killed because of our failure to combat racism and misogyny, said Amy Go, president of Chinese Canadian National Council for Social Justice, an advocacy group, during the briefing.
Asian-Canadian women should not be held hostage by fear and potential threats to our lives because of our failure. We need action now, Amy said. - FNA

Police ignored the role of race and gender in the Georgia shootings. Here's what Asian advocates in Atlanta are saying about it,"Changa, Anoa",Others,2021-03-18,"Georgia activists have mobilized to help the families of six Asian women killed on March 16. 
The attack has forced a conversation over misogyny and hypersexualization directed at Asian women. 
Georgia officials came under fire for accepting the alleged shooter's narrative of the attack. * See more stories on Insider's business page.
E. Lim had little time to process the brutal attack that claimed the lives of six Asian women and two others at three Metro-Atlanta spas.
As the organizing and civic engagement director for Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, Lim-like many of their colleagues-was in response mode. Atlanta born and raised and a local organizer since 2015, Lim told Insider their initial reaction was to detach from the killings.
""I've had to dissociate so hard, because I know people in similar situations,"" said Lim referring to the common experience of sexual harassment and sexual assault in the workplace.
The horrific violence that unfolded on Tuesday night in Atlanta has forced a national conversation over the long history of anti-Asian violence and discrimination, as well as the misogyny and hypersexualization directed at Asian women in this country.
The official narrative of what happened, which seemed to accept the explanation given by the assailant, has also galvanized Asian-American activists and organizers in Georgia to turn this into a teachable moment.
""It is racialized,"" said Lim. ""When you talk about 'massage parlors' and then talk about how sex work might be involved, you're talking about race.""
A statement condemning systemic racism and gender-based violence had 180 signatories from state and national organizations, said Stephanie Cho, director of the AAAJ-Atlanta. The group is fundraising to support the families of those killed.
""White supremacy is literally killing us,"" said Cho. ""Asian American communities have been under the radar on this issue, but honestly, this is a time for us to really come together, be in solidarity, and really have those tough conversations community conversations around policy.
""YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RACE"" 
Beginning at around 5pm on Tuesday night, a gunman attacked a massage parlor north of Atlanta, and then two other massage parlors in metro Atlanta, killing six Asian women and two others.
The Cherokee County Sheriff's Department identified the four people killed at Young's Asian Massage as Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Xiaojie Tan, 49; and Daoyou Feng, 44. Elcias R. Hernandez-Ortiz, 30, was also injured in the shooting. As of Thursday morning, the Atlanta Police Department had not released the names of the four people killed at the two spas in Atlanta.Sent from my iPhone
Around 6% of the population in metro Atlanta identifies as Asian, according to Atlanta Regional Commission's 2020 estimates. Cherokee County, where the first attack occurred, is around 2% Asian.
Almost immediately, the narrative of what had happened put forward by Georgia officials downplayed a ""racial motivation"" for the killings and relied on what the alleged killer had told police. Jay Baker, the spokesman for the Cherokee County Sheriff, said at a news conference that the suspect had had ""a really bad day,"" was ""kind of at the end of his rope,"" and had told police that he considers himself a ""sex addict.""
But community leaders in Atlanta had a clear message: The racism and misogyny impacting Asian women must not be ignored. And even if sex work was involved, the lives of these women were no less valuable than any other.
The killings also hit home hard for Wei Jia, a local organizer, who lives about a mile from one of the spas. Echoing others, Jia told Insider that the focus on whether the perpetrator was a sex addict fit into an old trope of a Jack the Ripper like character with no real interrogation of history.
""The sheriff sympathizing with the gunman, like saying that he just had a 'bad day' speaks volumes,"" said Jia. ""He didn't mention anything about the women that were killed. Didn't mention anything about their families, about their lives.""
Jia pointed to the long history of dehumanizing and sexualizing Asian women: Prior to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, The United States banned the immigration of Chinese Women in the Page Act of 1875 under the guise of preventing sex work.
""That a white male murdered Asian women in the United States is part of a very long history of white supremacist violence against anybody who wasn't white,"" Jia said.
Blaming an alleged sexual addiction as the motive in the killing of six Asian women and two others is itself racist, while taking the perpetrator at his word further victimized the victims and denied them their humanity, said Bentley Hudgins, a queer organizer based in Atlanta. ""They're so ready to distance themselves from calling this racist and misogyny and trying to downplay this as just like a white incel who was mad he didn't get off that they're missing the point entirely,"" Hudgins said in an interview.
Hudgins and Jia's comment came just hours before Buzzfeed News reported that Baker, the sheriff's department spokesperson, posted racist anti-Asian shirts on Facebook last April that blamed China for the Covid-19 pandemic.
According to the Stop AAPI Hate reporting center, which tracks xenophobic hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, 3,795 incidents have been reported between last March 19 and Feb. 28 of this year. Close to 70% of the incidents were against women. In a recent survey, NAPAWF found that nearly half of Asian American and Pacific Islander women have been affected by anti-Asian racism in the past two years.
THROUGH TRAGEDY, A TEACHABLE MOMENT 
Community advocates in Atlanta say they are prioritizing support for the victims' families and the community at large, and they explained those efforts at a press conference on Wednesday.
""Much of our focus is back towards the victims and their families and really what our communities need,"" Aisha Yaqoob Mahmood, executive director of the Asian American Advocacy Fund adding that legal services, mental health, and language support were needed.
Instead of allowing a sympathetic narrative toward the perpetrator to dominate coverage, attention should focus on reporting stories from the community and about how this attack impacted the community, she said. ""We continue to bring the focus back to who are the most vulnerable in our communities, and working towards making sure that we can provide safety and security for us all.""
The intersection of race, gender, and class colors the response and underlying assumption made about the worth of those killed, the organizers said, while the killing of six women in the course of their work also underscores the vulnerability of those in low-wage jobs.
""This is a gender and race based violence that happened to our community,"" said Leng Leng Chancey, Executive Director for 9to5, an organization focused on increasing economic security as well as political power and participation of working women.
She pointed to the challenges of dealing with sexual harassment and assault along with other institutional barriers. ""Low-wage workers already faced multiple hurdles and systemic racism every day,"" Chancey said. ""I mean, who can you really report this to?""
Organizers said the events of this week, horrific as they were, can serve as teachable moments for how to discuss and cover violent attacks on marginalized communities, and the importance of listening to individuals from those communities.
Shortly after the attacks, the Asian American Journalists Association issued a guidance saying the use of ""massage parlor"" as a descriptor to describe the business establishments is outdated and reinforces negative stereotypes that hypersexualize and dehumanize Asian women.
The guidance also stressed the need to study the context within which Asian communities are experiencing and receiving this latest news, while acknowledging the diversity within the ""Asian community.""
""The media needs to understand that the Asian community is not a monolith,"" Sarah Park, the president of the Atlanta chapter of the Korean American Coalition, said at Wednesday's press conference.
""We speak over hundreds of different languages. We practice different cultural religions, we are all different individuals.""

Hate stares at Asians from screens,"Zhang, Minlu",Others,2021-03-26,"Adding to dangers on streets, they also suffer rise in online abuse, US poll finds
Asian Americans have suffered the biggest spike in serious incidents of online hate and harassment compared with other groups in the United States, an annual survey released on Wednesday shows.
About 17 percent of Asian Americans surveyed by the Anti-Defamation League said that they experienced severe online harassment compared with the 11 percent reported last year, It was the largest uptick in comparison to other groups, according to the ADL, which monitors the activities of domestic and international hate groups.
The survey defines severe online harassment as sexual harassment, stalking, physical threats and sustained harassment as well as swatting and doxing - the latter two refer to false police reports and the disclosure of someone's personal details, respectively.
Half of the Asian-American respondents who were harassed said it was because of their race or identity. Overall, 21 percent of Asian-American respondents said they were harassed online.
The survey of 2,251 people conducted by YouGov, a public opinion and data analytics firm, shows that racist incidents against the Asian community aren't just happening offline.
""The spike in physical violence against Asian Americans across the nation was whipped up in large part by bigotry and conspiracy theories that grew online, fanned by national leaders, including former president (Donald) Trump's incendiary rhetoric blaming China for the pandemic and referring to the virus as the 'China plague' or 'kung flu',"" researchers said.
Anti-Asian sentiment increased 85 percent on Twitter after Trump was diagnosed with COVID-19 last fall, the report said. Trump also used the term ""China virus"" in several interviews.
Asian Americans experienced the most harassment on Facebook, followed by Twitter, Instagram and Google-owned YouTube, the report said.
700,000 tweets
A study published on March 17 by researchers at the University of California in San Francisco tracked nearly 700,000 tweets that used either the neutral hashtag ""#covid19"" or""#chinesevirus"" from March 9 to March 23, 2020.
Researchers found evidence of an association between the hashtag#chinesevirus and anti-Asian language. Twenty percent of tweets that used ""#covid19"" showed anti-Asian sentiment, compared with 50 percent of tweets that used the hashtag#chinesevirus.
Trump's use of the phrase in his speeches and on Twitter coincided with an increase in its use by others online, the report said. The mean number of daily users in the #covid19 group rose by 379 percent after Trump's tweet, compared with an increase of #chinesevirus by 8,351 percent, the report said.
The World Health Organization warned in 2015 that naming diseases after specific areas or ethnic groups can perpetuate xenophobia around the globe.
The WHO announced the official name COVID-19 for the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus on Feb 11, 2020. COVID-19 is an abbreviation of ""coronavirus disease 2019"". ""CO"" stands for corona, ""VI"" for virus and ""D"" for disease.
The WHO, as well as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, issued guidelines for this usage, warning against linking the disease to a specific place or area. Asian-American communities have warned for several months that political leaders' linking COVID-19 to China could lead to violence.
ADL chief executive Jonathan Greenblatt said the findings, which come amid a growing outcry over the rise in attacks on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders nationwide, show that efforts to curb surging anti-Asian sentiment by social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have fallen short.
The report was issued the day before the CEOs of Facebook, Google and Twitter were expected to appear virtually before the House of Representatives' Energy and Commerce Committee to address how false information around the pandemic and the election spreads online and to discuss their handling of misinformation, disinformation and other harmful content.

More Asian Americans are buying firearms to protect themselves amid a spike in anti-Asian hate crimes during the COVID-19 outbreak, according to Forbes.
""Before, there was never gun culture in the Asian community. But after the pandemic and all the hate crime going on, there are more Asians buying guns to defend themselves,"" Jimmy Gong, the owner of New York-based Jimmy's Sport Shop, was quoted as saying in the Forbes report.
During the pandemic, gun sales have doubled for Gong. About half of his business derives from Asian Americans, who also buy a lot of pepper spray, he told the outlet.
According to the report, gun stores across the US are also seeing an increasing number of Asian Americans purchasing firearms for self-defense purposes. Poway Weapons & Gear in California saw a 20% increase in Asian American first-time buyers over the past year compared with the year before that, said Danielle Jaymes, the store's general manager.
Six of the eight people killed in the Atlanta shootings on Tuesday were Asian women, although no motive for the shootings has been established.

Asian American community marches: Hundreds gather in Mesa to protest deadly attacks,"McDaniel, Michael; Cló, Renata",Others,2021-03-29,"""It's tough because these acts of hate kinda show no matter what, you're still a perpetual foreigner; people never look at you as American enough.""
Mi-Ai Parrish, ASU journalism professor
Hundreds of people holding signs, toting coolers of snacks and wearing masks marched in Mesa on Saturday to support Asian American communities victimized by harassment and hate.
Some signs had statements like, ""Love us like you love our food,"" ""Not your model minority, not your fetish, not another hate crime."" Others wore shirts that said, ""Stop Asian hate."" Children were among the crowd.
Nora Kish, who is half Korean, says the support of people who came here paints a more accurate version of the solidarity of the Asian community. Kish's mother, who immigrated in the 1980s, has been afraid since she was confronted by a group of men a few weeks ago.
""Really, it's white supremacy that is at the root of it all,"" she said. ""Just like a Black Matter Lives activist said, they will keep pitching us against each other until we get on the same page and unite against hate.""
Richelle Miller, who is of Filipino origin, said the growing hate made her want to stand up as an Asian American woman and stop brushing discrimination off.
""This is a country of immigrants, and targeting Asians because of coronavirus is totally uncalled for,"" she said. ""I feel people should try to reach out to one another and try to make connections because we are all immigrants.""
The march began at Mekong Plaza and the crowd repeated organizers in chanting ""Racism is a virus, you cannot divide us. Who keeps us safe? We keep us safe. Ain't no power like the power of the people 'cause the power of the people don't stop.""
Vicente Reid, CEO of the Arizona Asian Chamber, helped organize the event. He said violence against the Asian American community is not new, but the community has not spoken up enough about it.
""Our community has been here for a very long time, we essentially helped build Arizona ... And it's tough because these acts of hate kinda show no matter what, you're still a perpetual foreigner, people never look at you as American enough,"" he said. ""For me, growing up in Arizona, I've experienced a lot of racism and having two little children myself, I'm working day and night so they don't have to go through the same things.""
A table at the vigil for victims of anti-Asian attacks was styled as a traditional alter, laid with red cloth, photos of victims, incense, fruit and candles that read, ""You fetishize me, but do you protect me?""
A traditional Maori Haka dance was also performed.
Yuyu Tu, 40, said the Atlanta mass shooting makes her feel ""angry, but also embarrassed because we just took it (the hate) and nobody talked about it. We are not silent anymore.""
""It's important to be here for my children and their children,"" she said.
Organizers encouraged people to share stories of hate on stage, and also online at stopasianhateaz.org.
Mi-Ai Parrish, Sue Clark-Johnson Chair of Media Innovation and Leadership at ASU's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communications and former publisher of The Arizona Republic, said she felt alone until recently, and that was why she had never told her personal story.
""My whole life has been filled with stories of race, and those are stories that I never talked about,"" she said. ""The story that I was four before I met my father's parents because they didn't approve of my mother. The stories of the kids taunting me on the playground pretending they didn't understand what my mother was saying because of her accent, even though she has a Ph.D. from USC.""
This is the second event held to protest anti-Asian attacks across the country. On March 21, hundreds of people showed up to Chandler City Hall, despite the event being organized in less than a day.
Anti-Asian sentiment gained force last year following statements from former President Donald Trump, who often refers to COVID-19 as the ""China virus"" or ""Kung Flu."" The references opened up attacks and xenophobic messaging for people of Asian descent nationwide.
More than 3,000 incidents of anti-Asian hate, including 43 in Arizona, have been reported since March 19, 2020, said Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University who oversees the Stop AAPI Hate Campaign.
As a response to the Atlanta shootings, President Joe Biden has encouraged Congress to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. The bill would help local governments improve hate crime reporting and response.
Anti-Asian attacks
worry advocates
Advocates for the Asian American community have been alarmed by a string of recent attacks against older Asian Americans, including a 74-year-old Juanito Falcon, who died after being assaulted at Christown Spectrum Mall in Phoenix.
His family believes he was targeted for being Filipino, though Phoenix police said they do not have evidence or information to indicate the attack was motivated by bias.
Fears were further raised following the Atlanta area mass shooting on March 18 when a gunman opened fire at three spas, killing eight people, six of whom were of Asian descent.
One in four Americans, including nearly half of Asian Americans, in recent weeks, have seen someone blame Asian people for the coronavirus epidemic, a new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll found. The nationwide survey was taken Thursday and Friday in the wake of the recent shootings.
The actual number of anti-Asian incidents is most likely much higher because many incidents go unreported, Jeung said.

"Asian Grandma Punched in the Nose, Spit at","Tamanaha, Akemi",Others,2021-03-12,"An 83-year-old Asian woman was punched in the nose and spat at on the sidewalk in White Plains, New York
Tuesday night, ABC 7 New York reports.
Nancy Toh was standing outside Westchester Mall in White plains around 7:30 p.m. when a man approached her.
Toh says that the man cocked his head back, spat at her and punched her in the nose, according to The New
York Post.The punch knocked Toh to the ground. She hit her head and fell unconsciouss.
When she came to, Toh told ABC 7 New York a good Samaritan was tending to her. She was covered in blood.
“Bleeding lots from the brain. Looks like pumping out,” Toh said.
Toh’s daughter Linda Toh said the attack has made her more afraid.
“I didn’t think it was so close to home,” Linda Toh told ABC 7 New York. “And now I’m afraid to go out and my
kid is afraid to go out.”
The suspect is an unhoused man who, according to police, has a violent history. White Plains Police say they’re
throwing all their resources behind incidents like this one.
“An incident like this — we throw all our resources at it,” White Plains Police Department Capt. James Spencer said, according to ABC 7 New York. “This was a very disturbing and serious incident that occurred in a safe city.
And it’s one that we won’t tolerate.”

"SJ Asian Americans express fear, resolve","Trethan, Phaedra",Others,2021-03-29,"Allison Wang, a Cherry Hill resident since 2007, came to this country because she, like generations of immigrants before her, believed in the American ideal.
""What made America great is the open and welcoming culture of diversity,"" said Wang, an accounting director with a healthcare company and a mother of two. ""That's why it attracts so many talented and diverse people.""
But recently, she and other Asian Americans like her have wondered, ""Is this really the country we signed up for?""
Recent attacks on Asian Americans, many brought on by hatred and misplaced blame for the COVID-19 pandemic, have created a sense of fear among a diverse community made up of several cultures, nationalities, languages and histories who are all nonetheless often seen as a monolith.
And the brutal murders of eight people — six of them Asian women — in Atlanta have fueled more fear among Asian Americans in South Jersey, but also a sense of resolve that the time to act to end hate is long overdue.
During a Zoom meeting arranged by the Asian American Alliance of South Jersey, several people talked about their experiences with discrimination and racism and their fears for their families and themselves.
They and others also expressed hope that, in the same way that the killing of George Floyd sparked a reckoning over treatment of Black Americans, the Atlanta shootings might also bring recognition, support and action to stop the targeting of Asian Americans.
Nothing new, but worse than ever
Edward Wang is a professor of Asian history at Rowan University who has lived in the United States for more than 30 years. A former member of the Cherry Hill Board of Education and a native of Shanghai, China, he said anti-Asian sentiment is nothing new.
""Looking back in this country's history, Asian Americans have been discriminated against since at least 1882, with the Chinese Exclusion Act,"" he noted. Before 1965's Immigration and Nationality Act, quotas kept most Asians from becoming American citizens.
But even for those who are citizens, including Asians born in the United States, there is discrimination.
""We are constantly being asked, 'where did you come from?'"" said Wang. ""People assume that if you are Asian you must be a recent immigrant. It's not very comfortable for us.""
U.S. Rep. Andy Kim represents New Jersey's Third District and is the son of Korean immigrants.
""The short answer is yes, I have experienced racist discrimination, and so have members of my family along with many others in South Jersey,"" Kim told the Courier-Post.
People avoided him, told him they worried he could give them the coronavirus; he had heard from Asian restaurateurs whose businesses were targeted with racist graffiti.
Rhetoric used by former President Donald Trump, especially his use of terms like ""China virus"" and ""kung flu,"" made things worse, creating a sense of blame as COVID-19 forced lockdowns, and the lockdowns caused the economy to crater.
""We know that discrimination existed before coronavirus and sadly it will continue after this is over,"" said Kim, a Democrat. ""But this has been gasoline poured over a fire.""
Kim worries that as tensions escalate with China over issues like trade and human rights, xenophobia, hate and discrimination could escalate as well.
And many Asian Americans worry not only for themselves, but for their families.
""All Asian American kids have experienced this kind of discrimination, but the pandemic has raised it to a level that cannot go unnoticed, and must be stopped,"" said Xiufang Chen, a Cherry Hill resident and mother.
""This is the first time I don't feel safe,"" said Li Li, the principal of Cherry Hill Huaxia Chinese who is originally from Xi'an, China. Some parents she's spoken with, she said, ""don't want to make a big fuss, or want to let it go, but really we shouldn't. ... We should let our kids know what (behavior) is right and what is wrong.""
The 'model minority' problem
Often seen as ""model minority,"" a monolith of hardworking, industrious and entrepreneurial people, Asian Americans are really a diverse race from countries with very distinct cultures, languages, histories and cuisines.
For example, there are 56 ethnic groups in China and linguists estimate 297 living languages are spoken among the 1.21 billion people in Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Tibet. The Philippines is a nation with more than 7,000 islands and more than 170 ethnic groups, influenced by centuries of migration and conquest from Malaysia, South Asia, Spain, China and the United States.
""The model minority is a damaging perception, but it's one that lends itself to people thinking they can ignore (Asian Americans), that they are off doing their own thing, that if they don't complain then everything must be going well,"" said Kim.
Many Asian Americans don't speak up, he acknowledged, ""because they don't think anything will happen or that anyone will care,"" leading to greater feelings of isolation.
""Many in the Asian community struggle,"" said Chen. ""Sometimes when I think of this tragedy (the Atlanta shootings) I get angry, because did it take this happening for people to realize Asian Americans deserve attention?""
""It dodges the real problem we have,"" said Nina Gao, president of the Asian American Alliance of South Jersey and Shanghai native who lives in Cherry Hill.
""It is a way to wedge us out of the mainstream: You can take care of yourselves, you all live in these Chinatowns. We give you this glorious title, but it keeps us away, it makes us feel very foreign.""
""We're thought of as self-supporting and people who make a lot of money, and that makes us targets,"" said Wen Gu, a librarian from Cherry Hill.
""Many Americans don't want to take the time to really learn about us, so they lump us all together,"" said Gao, who is on the faculty of Rutgers University's biomedical and health services department. ""They think we are all the same, we all eat weird food and speak a weird language, that we are not Americans.""
""People don't notice us because we keep our heads down and we work hard,"" said Doris Zheng, a 21-year-old Rutgers–Camden student. Her family emigrated from a small city in Southeast China more than 20 years ago; her father is a chef and her mother is a home health aide.
Zheng, vice president of the university's Student Government Association, said she's supportive of Black and brown people's struggles with systemic racism in American. ""But Asian Americans are often hidden, in the dark, and there's this idea that we're smart and work hard and we don't need any help.
""There's this perception of us as prim and proper and perfect. We seem to be doing fine, but really that's because we are working so damn hard.""
The model minority idea, she noted, is not only damaging to Asians — it also minimizes the very real problems faced by Black and brown Americans, making others think they should overcome obstacles as well as Asians do, without understanding the differences in their histories, and the kinds of racism they encounter.
Is Atlanta a tipping point?
Kim pointed to ""this moment of mourning"" for the victims of the Atlanta shootings — and initial news of the shootings, which first characterized the shooter's sex addiction as a motive, drawing a strong backlash — as an event that brought the problem of anti-Asian hate to light.
In a February address to the nation to acknowledge the loss of 500,000 Americans to COVID-19, President Joe Biden urged an end to attacks on Asian Americans, Kim noted. The President and Vice President Kamala Harris met with Asian American leaders in Atlanta on March 19.
""People have told me they finally feel heard and seen,"" said Kim. ""The question now is, is it going to be sustained, even after this tragedy falls out of the spotlight? Is this something durable that can lead to change? Many of us have been calling for that for at least a year.""
""What bothers me about Atlanta is blaming a hate crime on a sex addiction, which this is clearly not,"" said Gao. ""This was obviously targeting Asian women.""
Jinwei Cao recalled an incident in June, when apartment residents in Newark, Delaware, found fliers that said ""Kill Chinese virus"" at their doors.
The incident rattled students at the University of Delaware, where Cao teaches. While she was satisfied with the police and university responses to the fliers, she said ""it was really unacceptable.""
""The Atlanta shootings, I heard from so many friends and students who felt like this is a breaking point,"" said Gao.
""It's threatening our very existence in this country.""
Stepping up and weighing next steps
Edward Wang said he's been in conference calls with other Asian American groups nationwide.
There is talk of a national march, like the Black Lives Matter marches that took place in the wake of the George Floyd killing in May.
He's hoping more attention — from politicians, policymakers, media and educators — will lead to more knowledge of the struggles of Asian Americans, as well as a greater appreciation of their many different cultures, histories and contributions.
Asian Americans, like so many other Americans, have stepped up to help in myriad ways during the pandemic.
""There are so many Asian Americans on the front lines,"" said Kim. ""Like the very large community of Filipino American nurses. Doctors. Small business owners.""
The Asian American Alliance of South Jersey has organized food giveaways and collected donations for personal protective equipment to hospitals and first responders, its members said. They've delivered meals to local police departments and helped furloughed workers.
Xiaoping Ma, a physician who lives in Cherry Hill, heard alarming news from her native Wuhan, China, as the virus began to spread there. She recalls being among the first to always wear a face mask, warning others to do the same, and hearing the fear and desperation from friends, family and medical school classmates there.
She helped organize donation drives through the Chinese American Physicians Association, connected with colleagues in Wuhan as they learned more about how to contain the virus, sharing information and insight — all while dealing with her own fear for family members and fellow medical professionals here and in Wuhan.
Ma, who has been in the United States since 1989 and has been a citizen since the 1990s, said she felt guilty that Wuhan was the place where the virus originated — but angry at the way it was characterized here.
""When the previous president called it 'the China virus,' the 'Wuhan virus,' it made me so angry, so afraid. How can an American president be so uneducated and say those things? But I tried to stay anchored on my work.""
""We want people to know we are part of the community,"" said Gao.
""I see a lot of hope; a lot of people have reached out"" to show support, said Sharon Xiaoyun Hou. She's received support from the University of Pennsylvania, where she works. ""People checked in on me to see if I was OK, and that shows me how most of the people in America really are.""
Ma said her running group, which includes Black, white, gay, straight and Asian runners, rallied around her. Running and a new Peloton bike have been her primary stress relievers, she said. ""I don't think I've ever run so much as I have the last year.""
""Although many of us are first generation (immigrants), we are all United States citizens,"" said Li.
""We love this country and we want it to be better.""

OpEd: Finding real solutions to ending anti-Asian hate crimes,"Zhao, Peter",Others,2021-03-23,"I was having a talk with my wife and my 2 kids earlier.
We were talking about racism and hate crimes.
My boys are still little, 3 and 7, but whether or not they understood what mommy and daddy said, we adults have to say what we adults have to say.
They will remember, children’s brains are like recording machines.
When my wife texted me that January afternoon of 2020, she told me she was called a “diseased Chinese bitch” by her attacker and she was in the ER getting stitches on her forehead. It was so unexpected as I was having a normal day working from the office, I immediately put aside my work and rushed home. This was around January of last year when the country was still business as usual, but the looming threat of the Covid19 Pandemic has already penetrated people’s consciousness.
Asians wearing face masks on the streets were singled out.
This was also around the time when the tit for tat tradewar and xenophobic rhetorics have already been retweeted and shared many times. The news of Chinese government cover ups echoed from social media to the streets. This concoction of fear, anxiety, and dirty politics gave rise to a new wave of hate based crimes that specifically targeted Asians. Presidential rhetorics like “Chinavirus” played a catalytic role to help spread this new wave of xenophobic anxiety by linking the Virus’ origin to those people who are also Americans but of Asian ancestry.
My wife’s attack took place outside of my son’s school during rush hour at school drop off time.
The attacker was also a mother of a student and she was road raging.
She thought my wife was an easy target when she came out of her car to scream at my wife at the Red Light. This was all because she couldn’t cut in front of my wife’s car.
While the assailant was striking my wife’s head with her phone, my wife was blinded from the pouring blood coming out of forehead. Many passersby were parents, but everyone stood there while this was going on and no one intervened or screamed for help. But after my wife called the police, some passersby offered assistance and said the attacker had a history of anger problems outside of the school.
My wife had eye witnesses, dash cam video with sounds, yet the cop paid very little attention to my wife who suffered from the hate attack. Instead of arresting the assailant and recognizing this was a hate crime, the police instead treated this attack as a fight and arrested the attacker as well as my wife. My wife was verbally attacked with hateful racist slurs, then physically assaulted that required stitches and endured concussion. Instead of healing the wounds we had to spend extra time and money to lawyer up and fight for her innocence. We didn’t go outside to look for trouble, but the trouble found us, and on top the corrupt system further hurt us.
Through social media, our incident got the attention of local community activists in Flushing.
We were introduced to community organizations like “AALDEF The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund” and Minh Kwon Center. These nonprofit organizations have a long history of helping the community through tough times. We were told we can tap into these organizations to find lawyers. But we were also told the most effective option is to reach out to the media and make this incident big. We were told to throw a rally and hopefully we can make the matter big enough and attract local elected officials. We were told to file a hate crime report. We called the Hate Crime hotline. We also filed a Hate Crime report at the official government website. But like casting a stone into the abyss, no one followed up with us and our case was forgotten.
At the time there was no NYPD Asian Hate Crime Task Force . My wife’s hate attack experience was before George Floyd, was before the hundred of thousands of Covid deaths in America, and at a time when these new waves of attacks were still in a mythical and debated stage. Anti-Asian Crimes and xenophobic sentiments aren’t just a recent phenomenon but we find this rooted in American civil rights history, remember 1871 Chinese Massacre and 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, Japanese internment camp in WWII, and Vincent Chin are a few examples in history.
I am outspoken but my wife is private and reserved. Even if a reporter approached me, without my wife’s consent, I wouldn’t be able to talk about her ordeal until she, the victim, feels comfortable. After my wife made phone calls to these defense leagues and community centers, she ran into misunderstandings, rudeness, and poor follow ups. She was told at one point there aren’t enough criminal laws and we were told the attorneys available don’t handle this type of case. After many phone calls and circling emails, we found ourselves back at the drawing table. Later I learned these public defense funds and community associations aren’t always inadequately funded and under staffed.
During the time of crisis, my wife’s case was being brushed aside.
More and more we felt there was a desperation for media exposure, but not from us, but from those who wanted to help us. My wife and I couldn’t help but to feel our pain and anger have been secretly exploited for other people’s future expansions in local politics. We’ve long heard lip service from local elected officials on TV who talked about how every voice counts and how they represent the people. But it seems without holding a rally, our lives don’t matter.
Finally we found a criminal defense lawyer recommended by the NY BAR Association.
For some reason, this lawyer was afraid to address the hate crime nature of our case.
Due to Covid19 lockdown, our case was delayed for a year and eventually Queens DA dismissed the case.
But what about justice for our family? Well, we are free to pursue the matter in the Civil Court.
If you have ever been litigated against or if you have litigated someone. If you have ever sat through criminal defense trials and paid the very expensive hourly lawyers fees. You should know suing someone isn’t as easy as saying it.
There are identical stories that echoes through the tight knit communities like Chinatown about how a Chinese take out delivery man was robbed and beaten. The police would tell the delivery man, if you are not hurt, then we are leaving, but feel free to sue your attacker in court. Instead of helping the victim to file a report, the cops neglected their responsibility and took the easy way out by ignoring the real needs of the victim. Over time, this type of neglectful attitude felt by the community contributed to a general mistrust toward the police.
Even though, by end Summer of 2020, the grassroot Anti-Asian hate crime movement and #TheycantburnusAll have helped create the NYPD Asian Hate Crime Task Force. To many in the Asian community, this new task force is just another show aimed to calm the media.
However, those who volunteered in this lowly funded task force are Asian police officers who also have family members who are living in fear from the waves of Asian attacks. These Asian police officers desperately try to help bridge the gaps and bandage the wounds because they understand that too many victims only want to expose their hate attack experience on social media but they don’t want to report to the police due to mistrust.
I learned from my activist friends like Don Lee from Chinatown and corruption-fighting whistle-blower Asian police officer Sergeant Steve Lee from Flushing about ideas like a hotline that can help centralize the resources to help the community to report Anti-Asian Hate Crimes. From my wife’s experience I felt we do have the talents and resources, but they are scattered. Community legal teams are lowly funded and need better leadership. I think the idea of centralizing these resources by creating a hotline is a great idea, because many Asians in our community may still feel uncomfortable reporting crime to police because they don’t trust the police. Before we can restore the police and community relationship, I feel a hot line can help victims report hate crimes without calling the police directly. And most importantly an independent agency which forwards hate crimes reports to the police can accurately track the number of Hate crimes against Asians.
This weekend, we joined our friends, allies, and hundreds of people and we rallied against hate at Columbus Park in Chinatown New York.
The large and diverse crowd of Asians and non-Asians banded together to show support and fight against racism and hate. We chanted, Asian Lives Matters, Black Lives Matters, We are golden, we are worthy. Rapper McJin came on stage with his 8-year-old son to help fight back hate and remind the crowd that in New York City everyday is Lunar New Year. While we stood in solidarity, I could not help but to wonder to myself why is it people have to die and why do we always have to band together in emotional rallies in order to make the system finally hear us and make some changes. I wish one day the system can finally work for us.
There are grassroot movements coast to coast to help make the Asian communities in America feel safer. From blockwatches to train stop escorts, I see people of all colors and backgrounds banding together to make us feel we are not alone and people do care. I hope our elected officials can communicate more for practical solutions rather than big ideas and campaign promises. I hope the victims one day don’t have to feel like the only solution they have is to amplify their pain to the media in order to get the attention they deserve. Among the supporters fighting back against hate crimes there are also those who strongly feel Defunding the police is an important solution. In my opinion I feel there are places in the budget where we should defund the police such as in areas of legal protection for the cops, but for special units like the NYPD Asian Hate Crime Task Force, they need more funding. I hope our lawmakers can one day turn the NYPD Asian Hate Crime Task Force from a voluntary unit to a permanent special department.
From my own observation as an Asian New Yorker I feel we tend to complain among each other about how nothing works and nothing changes, but ourselves are still silent to the world outside of our community. Like Mc Jin said, it doesn’t matter if you have a social following of 70 people or 7000 people, every one of our voices count. I hope we all can continue to make our important dialogues and to share not just about our cultures and differences, but we need to talk about all the good, the bad, and the ugly. When we see someone being harassed or attacked we should speak out. When we see something wrong we should say something and do something about it.
There are knots that need to be untied and grudges need to be settled, we must keep on talking.

"JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's letter on anti-Asian hate is a great example of bold, anti-racist leadership","Ward, Marguerite",Others,2021-03-18,"  One day after six Asian women were killed in a shooting rampage, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon sent a letter to all 255,000 of his employees. 
  The letter condemned the spike in violence against the Asian and Pacific Island community. 
  Public relations experts said the timing, tone, and content of the memo served as an example for other leaders looking to speak out.* See more stories on Insider's business page.
Eight people, including six Asian women, were killed on Tuesday in a shooting rampage at three Atlanta-area spas.
On Wednesday, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon sent an email to the company's 255,000 employees to address the attacks and the disturbing trend in violence against Asian and Pacific Islander (API) people.
The alleged shooter, Robert Aaron Long, a white man, told police that race was not his motive, which law enforcement officials conveyed during a press conference Wednesday. But many say it's the latest incident in a string of anti-Asian attacks since the start of the pandemic.
One recent study based on police department statistics across major US cities found a 150% surge in anti-Asian hate crimes in 2020. Separate data from the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council showed over 2,800 firsthand accounts of anti-Asian hate between March and December of last year.
Dimon spoke out against racism and racial injustice amid the police-killing of George Floyd and later announced JPMorgan's $30 billion commitment to racial equity.
Public relations experts say his latest statement serves as an example for other leaders looking to speak out against hate.
A swift response
The subject line attached to Dimon's email was simple and clear, ""Enough is enough.""
He acknowledged the spike in anti-API violence and then wrote, ""These racist acts cannot - and will not - be tolerated."" PR veteran LaToya Evans said Dimon got the timing and tone right in his memo.
""He quickly addresses the reality that violence against the Asian and Pacific Islander community has increased since the pandemic,"" Evans said.
Dimon did not wait for details around the shooting to unfold to address the larger climate of hate. Instead, he responded swiftly to make sure employees knew where he stood.
""I think there is a danger in staying silent for racially charged events, simply because, at the very minimum, employees want to know that they are supported and that they are safe in their work environment,"" Evans told Insider in August.
The right tone
""We stand strong against bias,"" Dimon continued in his memo. ""These events are impacting our colleagues, families, friends, and partners in the API community. If you are experiencing or see something that concerns you, please report it here.""
The fact that Dimon took the time to issue a formal statement, as opposed to the organization simply tweeting out a one-line message is significant, PR expert Sara Brady said.
""It shows an authentic and meaningful mindset and culture,"" she said.
Both Brady and Evans agreed that Dimon's memo expressed a tone of sincere empathy and concern for his employees' well-being.
""He addresses the feelings and potential fear of the API community,"" Evans said.
Dimon also shared resources to get help for employees in the memo. ""The most effective thing a leader can do is speak out, condemn violent actions, and then take action for customers, employees, and partners by providing resources, and this memo has done all of that,"" Evans continued.
The CEO also pledged to take future action to support the API community.
""We are reviewing additional steps the firm can take to support the Asian community. In the coming weeks and months, we will host a series of events focusing on hate crime and cultural awareness, the impact of COVID-19, and the Future of Work for the Asian community,"" he wrote.
Many leaders publish supportive statements in the wake of racially charged events, Evans said, but Dimon ""continues to deliver action and resources when it comes to fighting injustice.""
Read the full memo here: 
Enough is enough 
On behalf of all of my partners on the Operating Committee: since the start of the global pandemic, countless violent and verbal attacks have occurred against members of the global Asian and Pacific Islander (API) community. On streets, online and in many Asian-owned small businesses, we are seeing physical assault, verbal harassment and refusal of service. Just last night, eight people were killed in the Atlanta area, six of whom were Asian. These racist acts cannot - and will not - be tolerated. 
We are equally saddened that more vulnerable populations are being targeted - youth, elderly and women are experiencing the brunt of the attacks.
These events are impacting our colleagues, families, friends and partners in the API community. If you are experiencing or see something that concerns you, please report it here.
We stand strong against bias. We are reviewing additional steps the firm can take to support the Asian community. In the coming weeks and months, we will host a series of events focusing on hate crime and cultural awareness, the impact of COVID-19 and the Future of Work for the Asian community. 
As leaders and employees, we encourage you to make your voices heard, use the Inclusion Toolkit to discuss these events in real time with your colleagues and take advantage of the Employee Assistance Program for personal support.
Our fight for fair treatment and equity is not for any one group - it's for all. We condemn racism in any form and, with fierce determination, stand united to defend equity, diversity and inclusion for all communities.

"YouTube reportedly refused to take down a song about robbing homes in a 'Chinese neighborhood,' infuriating employees","Akhtar, Allana",Others,2021-03-30,"Bloomberg reported YouTube did not remove a song about robbing houses in ""Chinese neighborhoods."" 
Employees reportedly pushed back on the decision. 
YouTube told Insider it will continue the discussion.* See more stories on Insider's business page.
YouTube refused to remove a song that talks about performing armed robbery in ""Chinese neighborhoods"" because they ""don't believe in bank accounts,"" Bloomberg reported Tuesday.
YouTube sent an email to employees that said the firm found the song - rapper YG's ""Meet the Flockers"" - highly offensive and hard to watch, but chose to keep the video up, according to Bloomberg.
The song, which was released in 2014, begins with the line: ""First, you find a house and scope it out. Find a Chinese neighborhood, 'cause they don't believe in bank accounts.""
In the email, YouTube said the firm chooses to keep videos that violate hate speech policy for educational and artistic purposes. Comedy routines and news stories depicting violent footage, for instance, can remain on the platform.
""Removing this video would have far-reaching implications for other musical content containing similarly violent or offensive lyrics, in genres ranging from rap to rock,"" the letter read, per Bloomberg's report.
Bloomberg reported that employees in message boards pushed back on YouTube's decision, prompting the company to hold a townhall to discuss the issue.
A YouTube representative did not confirm the company sent the letter cited in Bloomberg's story, but told Insider that it ""has an open culture and employees are encouraged to to share their views, even when they disagree with a decision.""
""We'll continue this dialogue as part of our ongoing work to balance openness with protecting the YouTube community at large,"" the spokesperson added.
Asian-American hate crimes in 16 US cities increased 149% in 2020, according to an analysis of police data by researchers at California State University in San Bernardino. Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition of groups tracking violence incidents, reported 3,795 incidents of verbal or physical attacks against Asian-Americans between March 2020 and February 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic.
On Tuesday, police said a suspect punched and kicked a 65-year-old Asian woman on her way to church in New York City. Security footage revealed a security guard closed the door of a nearby building instead of helping the woman.

Allison Wang, a Cherry Hill resident since 2007, came to this country because she, like generations of immigrants before her, believed in the American ideal. ""What made America great is the open and welcoming culture of diversity,"" said Wang, an accounting director with a healthcare company and a mother of two. ""That's why it attracts so many talented and diverse people."" But recently, she and other Asian Americans like her have wondered, ""Is this really the country we signed up for?""
Recent attacks on Asian Americans, many brought on by hatred and misplaced blame for the COVID-19 pandemic, have created a sense of fear among a diverse community made up of several cultures, nationalities, languages and histories who are all nonetheless often seen as a monolith.
And the brutal murders of eight people — six of them Asian women — in Atlanta have fueled more fear among Asian Americans in South Jersey, but also a sense of resolve that the time to act to end hate is long overdue.
During a Zoom meeting arranged by the Asian American Alliance of South Jersey, several people talked about their experiences with discrimination and racism and their fears for their families and themselves.
They and others also expressed hope that, in the same way that the killing of George Floyd sparked a reckoning over treatment of Black Americans, the Atlanta shootings might also bring recognition, support and action to stop the targeting of Asian Americans.
Nothing new, but worse than ever
Edward Wang is a professor of Asian history at Rowan University who has lived in the United States for more than 30 years. A former member of the Cherry Hill Board of Education and a native of Shanghai, China, he said anti-Asian sentiment is nothing new.
""Looking back in this country's history, Asian Americans have been discriminated against since at least 1882, with the Chinese Exclusion Act,"" he noted. Before 1965's Immigration and Nationality Act, quotas kept most Asians from becoming American citizens.
But even for those who are citizens, including Asians born in the United States, there is discrimination.
""We are constantly being asked, 'where did you come from?'"" said Wang. ""People assume that if you are Asian you must be a recent immigrant. It's not very comfortable for us.""
U.S. Rep. Andy Kim represents New Jersey's Third District and is the son of Korean immigrants.
""The short answer is yes, I have experienced racist discrimination, and so have members of my family along with many others in South Jersey,"" Kim told the Courier-Post.
People avoided him, told him they worried he could give them the coronavirus; he had heard from Asian restaurateurs whose businesses were targeted with racist graffiti.
Rhetoric used by former President Donald Trump, especially his use of terms like ""China virus"" and ""kung flu,"" made things worse, creating a sense of blame as COVID-19 forced lockdowns, and the lockdowns caused the economy to crater.
""We know that discrimination existed before coronavirus and sadly it will continue after this is over,"" said Kim, a Democrat. ""But this has been gasoline poured over a fire.""
Kim worries that as tensions escalate with China over issues like trade and human rights, xenophobia, hate and discrimination could escalate as well.
And many Asian Americans worry not only for themselves, but for their families.
""All Asian American kids have experienced this kind of discrimination, but the pandemic has raised it to a level that cannot go unnoticed, and must be stopped,"" said Xiufang Chen, a Cherry Hill resident and mother.
""This is the first time I don't feel safe,"" said Li Li, the principal of Cherry Hill Huaxia Chinese who is originally from Xi'an, China. Some parents she's spoken with, she said, ""don't want to make a big fuss, or want to let it go, but really we shouldn't. ... We should let our kids know what (behavior) is right and what is wrong.""
The 'model minority' problem
Often seen as ""model minority,"" a monolith of hardworking, industrious and entrepreneurial people, Asian Americans are really a diverse race from countries with very distinct cultures, languages, histories and cuisines.
For example, there are 56 ethnic groups in China and linguists estimate 297 living languages are spoken among the 1.21 billion people in Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Tibet. The Philippines is a nation with more than 7,000 islands and more than 170 ethnic groups, influenced by centuries of migration and conquest from Malaysia, South Asia, Spain, China and the United States.
""The model minority is a damaging perception, but it's one that lends itself to people thinking they can ignore (Asian Americans), that they are off doing their own thing, that if they don't complain then everything must be going well,"" said Kim.
Many Asian Americans don't speak up, he acknowledged, ""because they don't think anything will happen or that anyone will care,"" leading to greater feelings of isolation.
""Many in the Asian community struggle,"" said Chen. ""Sometimes when I think of this tragedy (the Atlanta shootings) I get angry, because did it take this happening for people to realize Asian Americans deserve attention?""
""It dodges the real problem we have,"" said Nina Gao, president of the Asian American Alliance of South Jersey and Shanghai native who lives in Cherry Hill.
""It is a way to wedge us out of the mainstream: You can take care of yourselves, you all live in these Chinatowns. We give you this glorious title, but it keeps us away, it makes us feel very foreign.""
""We're thought of as self-supporting and people who make a lot of money, and that makes us targets,"" said Wen Gu, a librarian from Cherry Hill.
""Many Americans don't want to take the time to really learn about us, so they lump us all together,"" said Gao, who is on the faculty of Rutgers University's biomedical and health services department. ""They think we are all the same, we all eat weird food and speak a weird language, that we are not Americans.""
""People don't notice us because we keep our heads down and we work hard,"" said Doris Zheng, a 21-year-old Rutgers–Camden student. Her family emigrated from a small city in Southeast China more than 20 years ago; her father is a chef and her mother is a home health aide.
Zheng, vice president of the university's Student Government Association, said she's supportive of Black and brown people's struggles with systemic racism in American. ""But Asian Americans are often hidden, in the dark, and there's this idea that we're smart and work hard and we don't need any help.
""There's this perception of us as prim and proper and perfect. We seem to be doing fine, but really that's because we are working so damn hard.""
The model minority idea, she noted, is not only damaging to Asians — it also minimizes the very real problems faced by Black and brown Americans, making others think they should overcome obstacles as well as Asians do, without understanding the differences in their histories, and the kinds of racism they encounter.
Is Atlanta a tipping point?
Kim pointed to ""this moment of mourning"" for the victims of the Atlanta shootings — and initial news of the shootings, which first characterized the shooter's sex addiction as a motive, drawing a strong backlash — as an event that brought the problem of anti-Asian hate to light.
In a February address to the nation to acknowledge the loss of 500,000 Americans to COVID-19, President Joe Biden urged an end to attacks on Asian Americans, Kim noted. The President and Vice President Kamala Harris met with Asian American leaders in Atlanta on March 19.
""People have told me they finally feel heard and seen,"" said Kim. ""The question now is, is it going to be sustained, even after this tragedy falls out of the spotlight? Is this something durable that can lead to change? Many of us have been calling for that for at least a year.""
""What bothers me about Atlanta is blaming a hate crime on a sex addiction, which this is clearly not,"" said Gao. ""This was obviously targeting Asian women.""
Jinwei Cao recalled an incident in June, when apartment residents in Newark, Delaware, found fliers that said ""Kill Chinese virus"" at their doors.
The incident rattled students at the University of Delaware, where Cao teaches. While she was satisfied with the police and university responses to the fliers, she said ""it was really unacceptable.""
""The Atlanta shootings, I heard from so many friends and students who felt like this is a breaking point,"" said Gao.
""It's threatening our very existence in this country.""
Stepping up and weighing next steps
Edward Wang said he's been in conference calls with other Asian American groups nationwide.
There is talk of a national march, like the Black Lives Matter marches that took place in the wake of the George Floyd killing in May.
Rallies by and in support of Asian Americans have been held in Philadelphia's Chinatown; another one is planned for 10 a.m. Sunday at the Chinatown Gate at 10th and Arch streets.
He's hoping more attention — from politicians, policymakers, media and educators — will lead to more knowledge of the struggles of Asian Americans, as well as a greater appreciation of their many different cultures, histories and contributions.
Asian Americans, like so many other Americans, have stepped up to help in myriad ways during the pandemic.
""There are so many Asian Americans on the front lines,"" said Kim. ""Like the very large community of Filipino American nurses. Doctors. Small business owners.""
The Asian American Alliance of South Jersey has organized food giveaways and collected donations for personal protective equipment to hospitals and first responders, its members said. They've delivered meals to local police departments and helped furloughed workers.
Xiaoping Ma, a physician who lives in Cherry Hill, heard alarming news from her native Wuhan, China, as the virus began to spread there. She recalls being among the first to always wear a face mask, warning others to do the same, and hearing the fear and desperation from friends, family and medical school classmates there.
She helped organize donation drives through the Chinese American Physicians Association, connected with colleagues in Wuhan as they learned more about how to contain the virus, sharing information and insight — all while dealing with her own fear for family members and fellow medical professionals here and in Wuhan.
Ma, who has been in the United States since 1989 and has been a citizen since the 1990s, said she felt guilty that Wuhan was the place where the virus originated — but angry at the way it was characterized here.
""When the previous president called it 'the China virus,' the 'Wuhan virus,' it made me so angry, so afraid. How can an American president be so uneducated and say those things? But I tried to stay anchored on my work.""
""We want people to know we are part of the community,"" said Gao.
""I see a lot of hope; a lot of people have reached out"" to show support, said Sharon Xiaoyun Hou. She's received support from the University of Pennsylvania, where she works. ""People checked in on me to see if I was OK, and that shows me how most of the people in America really are.""
Ma said her running group, which includes Black, white, gay, straight and Asian runners, rallied around her. Running and a new Peloton bike have been her primary stress relievers, she said. ""I don't think I've ever run so much as I have the last year.""
""Although many of us are first generation (immigrants), we are all United States citizens,"" said Li.
""We love this country and we want it to be better.""

Height of heightened racism,"Foster, Silvia; Frau; Liu, Marian; Knowles, Hannah; Meryl",Others,2021-03-21,"As Helen Kim Ho learned that a white man with a self-described sex addiction was charged with killing eight people — including six Asian women — at spas in the Atlanta area, she imagined the stereotypes of Asian women that must have run through his head.
""We’re not really Americans, we’re perpetually foreigners, and that idea plays out with women as being oversexualized,"" said Ho, a Korean American and a founder of Asian Americans Advancing Justice in Atlanta. ""All of that had to have played out in this man’s own mind. In addition to the unspoken notion that Asian people are easy targets.""
Atlanta police said the suspect told them his actions on Tuesday were not racially motivated — even though the shooter targeted businesses known for employing Asians, and six victims were Asian women. The suspect claimed he had a ""sex addiction,"" according to police, and wanted to eliminate temptation, which sounded to many women as if their sexuality was somehow to blame.
The gunman’s intent seemed crystal clear to Asians living in Atlanta and across the nation who have long had to confront stereotyping, hateful harassment and even violence — and who say things have gotten even worse amid the coronavirus pandemic.
For Asian women, the moment felt particularly threatening.
As soon as Crystal Jin Kim heard about the shooting, she reached out to her mother and father, who immigrated to the United States from Korea. In a text, she urged them ""to be safe, to be careful, and to pray.""
She thought about rescheduling one of their upcoming doctor appointments, and she worried about her mother going to work at a small business in the Atlanta area — she asked that the type of business not be named for fear of her mother being targeted.
""Since I was a kid I’ve heard racial slurs yelled at me or my parents, or witnessed my parents being treated as if they were stupid because their English isn’t perfect, even though my mom’s English is really good,"" said Kim, a second-generation Korean American. ""Those small moments really add up. I don’t think we’ve ever spoken up against those small moments ... It’s easier to try not to think about it, or to try to let it go. To try to bury the hurt.""
People have leaned out of cars to scream ""Asian!"" at her, she said, and she has gotten comments about how she must like Jackie Chan, the Hong Kong martial artist and actor. As an Asian woman, she said men often ascribe characteristics to her that don’t reflect her personality — that’s she’s a pushover, or soft-spoken.
""Really, I’m not — I’m very talkative and extroverted,"" Kim said. ""It’s just people having these assumptions and treating me like a perfect Asian girl. Not even a woman, but a girl.""
David Palumbio-Liu, a Stanford professor and author of ""Asian/American: Historical Crossings of a Racial Frontier,"" said there is a long history, extending well before the Vietnam War, of the fetishization of and murderous intent toward Asian women. He cited the Broadway musical ""Miss Saigon,"" which critics have said romanticizes an imperialistic relationship and portrays Asian women as acquiescent and self-sacrificing.
The suspect ""said it wasn’t racially motivated, but on the other hand, he’s going specifically to these spas where Asian women work precisely to serve the sexual fantasies of white males,"" Palumbio-Liu said in an interview, ""so to disentangle them is really to do a disservice to the fact that these things are so linked together.""
The shooting made visible the worst-case scenarios many Asians living in the United States had feared. Many sadly expressed a similar sentiment: We knew this was coming.
The coalition Stop AAPI Hate has been documenting anti-Asian attacks since the pandemic started last March and says there have been nearly 3,800 hate-fueled incidents against the Asian American and Pacific Islander community in the U.S. — a number the group says is likely a fraction of the true number. About 3 in 10 Asian adults said they’ve experienced jokes or slurs about their race or ethnicity during the pandemic, according to Pew Research — the highest percent among all races.
More than 68% of documented reports of anti-Asian harassment and violence since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic have been from women.
""I’ve never been this afraid to be Asian in America,"" said Dorothy Kuo, 38, who attempted to explain to her 6-year-old daughter what had happened in their community.
""I told her ‘Mommy is having a hard time focusing today because last night there were eight people killed.’ I just told her, honestly, what happened,"" said Kuo, who is Korean American, like several of the victims.
Kuo said she felt it was important to tell her daughter so she understands the world she’s stepping into, one in which she might have to be more careful as an Asian woman.
""I’ve been refused seating at a restaurant,"" Kuo said, ""and even then I’ve never felt what I feel now.""
Jane Kim Coloseus, 32, grew angry Wednesday when Atlanta police declared it was too soon to say whether the slayings were racially motivated.
""As an Asian woman, it brings out a lot of the experiences or harassment we have received throughout our lives in general, and just have that completely invalidated because of what the suspect is saying,"" said Coloseus, a Korean American who is executive director of the nonprofit Her Term, which recruits women to run for office in Georgia.
She has long felt like she had to be more guarded — whether it’s in the workplace or walking down the street — because of anti-Asian sentiments and the sexualization of Asian women’s bodies.
Asians have long been part of the fabric of the United States, she said, yet have ""been kept on the sidelines as the model minority,"" their voices ignored or muted.
""To me the equation is pretty straightforward,"" she said of the shooter’s intent. ""It is racially motivated.""

Xenophobic anti-China rhetoric behind rising number of attacks on Asians in US,None,Others,2021-03-01,"Although US President Joe Biden signed an executive action banning the use of rhetoric such as the ""China
virus"" or the ""kung flu"" within the federal government, the rise of hate crimes against Asians in the United
States has not been checked.
Many believe that is due to the xenophobia fostered by the previous president, who habitually used such terms
when talking about the pandemic.
An 84-year-old Thai immigrant in San Francisco died last month after being shoved to the ground during his
morning walk. An 89-year-old Chinese American woman was slapped and set on fire by two strangers in New
York. A 61-year-old Filipino American was slashed in the face by a stranger on the New York subway with a box
cutter. These are just some of the recent attacks on Asians in the US.
Although it might be difficult to determine the exact number of such hate crimes and instances of racial
discrimination against Asians in the US, statistics from a number of local police forces, rights groups and
institutes all point to the same conclusion: The surge in assaults and verbal abuse began with the start of the
COVID-19 pandemic in the country a year ago, when the previous US administration baselessly started using
rhetoric blaming China for the spread of the novel coronavirus. It is unlikely to ebb without the state
intervening.
Although it was part of the Trump administration's scheme to pass the buck to others, it has created aftershocks
that US society is still experiencing now, as by openly inciting ethnic hatred, the previous administration
awakened a dormant volcano in US society where discrimination against people of Asian descent has never
disappeared but only lurked at the bottom of some racists' hearts.
No wonder late last year, the United Nations issued a report warning of ""an alarming level"" of racially motivated
violence and other hate incidents against Asian Americans.
If the protests that swept the country after the brutal death of George Floyd on May 25 last year in Minneapolis
exposed the long-term tensions between white and black Americans, the outcries of a number of rights groups
calling for an end to the verbal, physical and mental abuse suffered by Asian Americans reveals the unfair
treatment they have for a long time had to endure. Discrimination and antipathy toward those of Asian descent
have become more evident with the previous president fanning the flames of xenophobia.
While more and more Asian Americans are setting up mutual assistance organizations and standing up to defend
their rights, particularly when no signs have appeared showing the tensions are likely to ease in the foreseeable
future, the US government, judicial authorities and law enforcement departments have no excuse to look on
with folded arms. Doing so, they will simply prove themselves to be birds of the same feather as the Trump
administration.
Until US society unites to battle the virus, the divisions and discrimination intentionally fostered by the Trump
administration will continue to take their toll on innocent lives.

Unafraid of attacks: Asian American people in Miss. Delta have no fear against violence,"Rowe, Keisha; Haselhorst, Sarah",Others,2021-03-20,"Attacks against Asian American people in the United States have been on the rise since the COVID-19 pandemic began, but for some residents in the Mississippi Delta, the thought of a similar event there feels unfathomable.
The Delta is different. It's insulated from the metropolitan world that's seen an uptick in violence toward Asian American people.
""I'm aware of the situation and I'm horrified,"" said Gilroy Chow, an 80-year-old retired Chinese American plant engineer who lives in Clarksdale. ""I can't say whether or not it was racially-motivated, but I am horrified that it happened.""
Asian American people make up 1% of Mississippi's population. Chinese American people living in the Delta hold a particularly rich history and still thrive as part of one of the most racially-diverse areas in the state.
Around 1870, Chinese people immigrated from China's Guangdong province to the Mississippi Delta for economic opportunity. They went on to open dozens of family-run grocery stores in Black neighborhoods dotted along the Mississippi River.
While marginal, Asian communities in the state remain tight-knit. Chow would know.
He's lived in Mississippi most of his life, but he can't recall a time he experienced anything to make him feel targeted in the state. He and his wife raised their two children in their Delta home.
What happened was terrible, Chow said, but he isn't sure it couldn't have happened to anyone else in Atlanta. He said he's more concerned about his family catching COVID-19 than by being targeted because of it.
Like Chow, Frieda Quon, 78, is Chinese American, and knows the Mississippi Delta well.
She's lived there her entire life. Having been a librarian at Delta State University before she retired, Quon said she's encountered many people over the years and never experienced racism in the area.
""We're civilized here,"" she said.
Seeing events over the past year where more Asian American people have been the targets of hate crimes has concerned her, but she said she feels that isn't something that can happen in Mississippi.
""Look down there in Jackson,"" she said. ""You don't really hear of any attacks against Asian people down there.""
More attacks could be happening because bigger cities have more people and cramped lifestyles can cause more stress among residents, Quon said. Combined with the COVID-19 pandemic, she said she thinks people are more on edge in general.
For Chow and Quon, the Delta has been a place free of discriminatory violence. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, only six racially-motivated hate crimes were reported in Mississippi in 2019 and none them occurred in the Delta region.
But outside that pocket, and into the bigger cities Quon talk about, the Tuesday incident in Atlanta is among the surge of violence toward Asian American people in the past year.
Atlanta Police Department officials have not ruled out the possibility to classify the shootings as hate crimes, but several organizations across the country and President Joe Biden have condemned the attacks as such.
Racist rhetoric stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in a market in Wuhan, China, is believed to have sparked these incidents of violence and harassment, according to data collected by Stop AAPI Hate.
The organization, formed to combat pandemic-driven racism against Asian American Pacific Islander communities, reported 3,795 incidents from March 19, 2020, to Feb. 28.
Verbal harassment and the deliberate avoidance of Asian American people made up 88% of reported incidents within the past year, but another 11% accounted for physical assaults. Of incidents recorded by Stop AAPI Hate, Chinese American people were the largest ethnic group to suffer discrimination.

Man arrested in brutal attack in Seattle’s International District,Randall,Others,2021-03-05,"Screen shot from surveillance videoPolice in Seattle Thursday arrested a 41-year-old man accused of swinging a
hard object wrapped in a sock into the heads of two people.
“I truly believe he was trying to kill us,” said Michael Poffenbarger, about him and his girlfriend to KOMO News.
“He hit her so hard (and) he hit me really really hard. I was amazed at how hard he hit my head and it didn’t
knock me out,” said Poffenbarger. “I thought for sure, I had a skull fracture.”
The State identified the other victim as high school teacher Noriko Nasu who suffered fractures to her face and
teeth.
The superintendent of the Northshore School District where Nasu works fears the attack may be racially
motivated.
“I am writing today to share my concerns regarding the current trend in increasing violence directed at Asian
community members both in our state and across our country,” Reid wrote in a blog post, according to The
State. “A member of our own Northshore staff family, Sensei Noriko Nasu, was brutally attacked while walking
with her partner in Seattle ... The police are currently investigating the attack to determine whether it was a
hate crime or a random attack, this assault should never have happened.”
Police identified the suspect as Sean Holdip. The Conan Daily reports he is from Brooklyn, but previously lived in Daly City outside San Francisco and in College Park, GA. He previously worked as a emergency medical
technician with the New York Fire Department.
According to the Daily, the Fire Department fired him in 2014 after he was accused of making threats against
two paramedics after pulling out a three to four inch blade. He lost an appeal in the case last year.
The police bias unit is investigating the crime, but has not concluded it is racially motivated.

Spike in Anti-Asian Hate Crimes,None,Others,2021-03-04,"HOST: LISA LAFLAMME
LISA LAFLAMME: On both sides of this closed border, COVID-19 has opened the door to an alarming spike in
anti-Asian hate crimes. Newly released video shows one of the latest disturbing assaults. A 67-year-old man
attacked by three people in a San Francisco Laundromat. The racism, though, has been fuelled not just by the
pandemic, but by politics. Here's CTV's Washington bureau chief Joy Malbon.
JOY MALBON (Reporter): At his tea shop in Washington, Yunhan Zhang worries who will come through the door
next. Last November, a man attacked him with pepper spray, yelling ""Chinese,"" ""COVID."" The assault left him
choking, angry, and sad, blaming an increase of anti-Asian racism in part on the words of Donald Trump.
DONALD TRUMP (Former US President): Some people call it the Chinese flu.
TRUMP: China virus.
TRUMP: Kung flu.
YUNHAN ZHANG (Valley Brooke Tea Owner): When leaders say those things, they lift that very thin layer of
protection. All the bigotry, all the hatred can just be unleashed like that.
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Asian piece of [Bleep]
MALBON: A surge of attacks caught on video. A grandmother punched and robbed in California. This man
brutally slashed in the face on the New York subway. And a grandfather in his San Francisco neighbourhood
beaten so badly he later died.
MONTHANUS RATANAPAKDEE (Daughter): He never wake up again. I never see him again.
MALBON: Advocacy groups tracked 3,000 hate incidents against Asian-Americans since March to December last
year. And it's happening in Canada, too. Despite a much smaller population, at least 1,000 incidents reported.
AMY GO (Chinese Canadian National Council for Social Justice): We have higher ratio of racist attacks.
MALBON: Amy Go is fourth generation Canadian, but one year into the COVID crisis, even she feels unsafe.
GO: We were blamed to bring SARS to Canada, just like we are blamed for bringing COVID to Canada. We are
definitely seen as foreigners. That's why we are told to go back to China.
MALBON: Now prominent Asian-American stars are speaking out.
DANIEL DAE KIM (Actor): We're so tired of having to say we are American.
MALBON: Former Raptors' player Jeremy Lin wrote about being called coronavirus on the court.
JEREMY LIN (Professional Basketball Player): My teammates heard it. Their teammates heard it. Nobody did
anything.
MALBON: President Joe Biden specifically condemned racism against Asian-Americans in an executive order. And
while it's a start, advocates say these attacks must be treated more seriously. Lisa.
LAFLAMME: So true. All right, Joy Malbon in Washington tonight.

Atlanta shootings show Asian Americans aren't recognized in country's identity,"Chu, Amanda",Others,2021-03-25,"When I found out about the shootings in Atlanta, the massacre of six women of Asian descent and two others by a white man, I started crying so hard I couldn't stop. I thought about my Asian American friends, my parents who work in small Chinese businesses, all the Asian women I know who raised me, who taught me, whose immigrant blood runs through mine. I thought about myself, how I grew up wanting to be American, not realizing I already was by my birthright, because as the extreme violence in Atlanta showed, the country does not recognize Asian people as part of the American identity.
First, let me say the women's names. Xiaojie Tan. Daoyou Feng. Soon Chung Park. Hyun Jung Grant. Suncha Kim. Yong Ae Yue. These were people with full lives. They had families who love them and now must mourn them. It doesn't matter what these people might have done for a living or what their citizenship status was or how ""American"" they were. The media's reluctance to call their murders a hate crime and their participation in racist stereotypes that sexualize Asian women is egregious. The superficial demonstrations of solidarity and understanding on social media are downright insulting.
Our failure to do the victims justice is indicative of how poorly we understand race in the United States. It is the product of our erasure of Asian Americans in U.S. history. We are not taught the contributions of Asian Americans in school. We do not read Asian American stories or see Asian Americans on TV with any regularity. The way we talk about and portray race in America is Black and white and renders Asian Americans invisible. We do not get to humanize them and see them as real people. So when we as a country are forced to confront the racist attacks against Asian Americans, we fail miserably.
The rise in anti-Asian sentiment has been going on for a full year, but it's important to remember that this is not the first wave. It frustrates me how quickly we forget that less than 80 years ago, one of our most progressive and revered presidents, Franklin D. Roosevelt, ordered all Japanese Americans into concentration camps. Or how one of the most violent lynchings in American history was done to the Chinese. And let's not forget the incredible abuse and racial profiling South Asians endured and continue to endure post 9/11.
Every time I look at this country's history, I see that women like me have always been denied a place. Afong Moy, in 1834, the first recognized Chinese woman to come to the U.S., was turned into an exhibition to American people, carted off to cities where people paid 25 cents to see her. This is also not the first time the media has failed Asian Americans. News outlets have long been criticized for failing to cover issues in Asian American communities, further marginalizing them in local decision-making, or when they do, for perpetuating stereotypes of the model minority. Likewise, while some blame former President Donald Trump for contributing to the rise in anti-Asian sentiment by calling COVID-19 ""Kung-flu"" or the ""China Virus,"" he's not the first politician to use such language. Senators called Chinese immigrants ""rats,"" ""beasts,"" and ""swine"" before passing the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, the first and only federal law to limit a group's entry based on race.
Words have power. The stories we select to construct our national identity have consequences. While Asian Americans have been deemed perpetually foreign, many would be surprised to know that the first Asians in America can be traced back to as early as the 1500s. Why Asian Americans don't make up a larger part of the U.S. population is a result of centuries of discriminatory immigration laws, not to mention labor and education ones.
A friend asked me recently, ""Well, how do you want people to respond?"" I didn't know what to say. I still don't. Any chance at racial justice will require a radical reformation of how we think about race in America. It will require partnerships with other minority groups. Statements of solidarity must be backed by action. As history shows, anti-Asian sentiment repeats itself. The current terms we use, ""exotification,"" ""sexualization,"" ""exclusion,"" ""model minority,"" help us conceptualize and label the racism that Asian Americans experience, but I worry they are clinical and prevent us from feeling the empathy that is so needed at this moment.
What I will say is this. I want to see hate-crime reform. I want Asian American history taught in classrooms. I want to see more Asian Americans in government, in Hollywood, on everyday bookshelves, so that one day someone might look at me and not question whether I belong here. So that someone might look at me and not make assumptions because of my race. I already know people like me can serve the country well, that they can be dynamic and brilliant and brave. America must see that too.

US has a long history of violence against Asian women,"Leong, Karen; Kuo, Karen",Others,2021-03-22,"Asian American women understand that the alleged murderer of eight people in Atlanta was acting in keeping with a culture filled with racialized and sexualized views of Asian women. Of the people murdered, four women were of Korean descent and two of Chinese heritage.
The shooter himself, Robert Long, has said he was motivated to act violently because of his self-proclaimed “sex addiction.” He allegedly told investigators that the businesses he attacked represented “a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate.”
Long sought to eliminate the objects of his sexual temptations, Asian women. In doing so, he drew on the U.S.‘s long history of sexualizing Asian American women.
A long history of stereotypes
Harmful stereotypes of Asian women in American popular culture date back to at least the 19th century. Back then, American missionaries and military personnel in Asia viewed the women they met there as exotic and submissive.
These stereotypes influenced the first U.S. immigration law based on race, the 1875 Page Act, which prevented Chinese women from entering the United States. The official assumption was that, unless proven otherwise, Chinese women seeking to enter the United States lacked moral character and were prostitutes. In fact, many were wives seeking to reunite with their husbands who had already come to the U.S.
Around the same time, Chinese women in San Francisco also were scapegoated by local public health officials who feared they would spread sexually transmitted diseases to white men, who would then spread it to their wives.
In the mid-20th century, U.S. wars and military bases in China, Japan, the Philippines, Korea and Vietnam resulted in increased interracial contact between American soldiers and Asian women. The GIs’ restricted interactions with the larger Asian population meant that they met Asian women that worked on or near the military bases: on-base service workers who cleaned or cooked, or sex workers in the surrounding communities.
Some soldiers married Asian women and brought them home as war brides, while others primarily viewed Asian women as sexual objects. Both approaches perpetuated stereotypes of Asian women as sexually submissive, either as ideal wives or sexually exotic prostitutes.
These stereotypes are evident throughout U.S. popular culture in the form of novels and movies, including “The Teahouse of the August Moon” and James Michener’s “The Bridges at Toko-Ri,” which feature romances between GIs and Asian women. Vietnam War-era films like “Full Metal Jacket” and “Platoon” depict graphic sexual violence committed by American GIs against Vietnamese women.
Violence against Asian American women
In online digital pornography, Asian women are disproportionately presented as victims of rape, compared to white women or women of other racial backgrounds. Asian American feminist and activist Helen Zia has argued that there is a connection between the portrayals of Asian women in pornography and violence against Asian American women.
Rosalind Chou, a sociologist, describes how in 2000, a group of white men kidnapped five Japanese female exchange students in Spokane, Washington, to fulfill their sexual fantasies of Asian female bondage, a subgenre of pornography.
Sexual attacks targeting Asian American women are more likely to come from non-Asians. Though most attacks on white or Black women come from men of the same ethnic background, Asian American women – and Native American women – are more likely to be sexually assaulted by males of a different ethnicity.
The most recent high-profile example of this dynamic is the 2015 rape of a woman by white Stanford student Brock Turner. Not until 2019 did the woman, Chanel Miller, reveal her name and identity as an Asian American woman. At that point many Asian American women understood another element of what had already been a troubling case of white male sexual aggression: Turner likely felt entitled to use and abuse Miller’s unconscious body not just because she is a woman, but because of her Asian heritage.
Targeted attacks
In March 2020, Asian American and Pacific Islander community organizations joined with San Francisco State University’s Asian American Studies Program to document incidents of anti-Asian racism occurring across the country during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group they formed, called StopAAPIHate, has recorded an average of 11 anti-Asian hate incidents in the U.S. each day since its creation, including in-person and online verbal harassment, civil rights violations and physical assaults.
The group has found that Asian women report hate incidents 2.3 times as often as Asian men. The data doesn’t distinguish between sexual assaults or harassment and other types of physical attacks and harassment, but it nevertheless emphasizes the vulnerability of being Asian and being female.
Oppression of women of color
Asian women are not the only targets of racial and sexual violence. Any non-white woman has a greater risk of these perils than white women do.
One day after the white male shooter in Georgia killed six Asian women, an armed white man was detained outside Vice President Kamala Harris’ official residence in Washington, D.C. As a mixed-race South Asian and Black woman, Harris is not exempt from this culture that racializes and sexualizes Asian women and all women of color. None of us is.

America’s diverse Asian communities unite against hate,"Kiefer, Francine",Others,2021-03-19,"It’s a “tipping point,” “an inflection,” a “crisis point.” That’s what Asian American leaders are calling this week in which eight people have been fatally shot at Asian spas in Atlanta. The mass shooting, they say, is a culmination of a yearlong surge in hate crimes and racist incidents against this highly diverse and sometimes split community, uniting them as never before.
From California to New York, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have put out statements and are organizing vigils to grieve for the victims in the Atlanta shooting, six of whom were women of Asian descent. On March 18, Congress held the first hearing on anti-Asian discrimination in more than 30 years. The day before in California, a diverse group of Asian American political leaders, plus Latino politicians, called on Gov. Gavin Newsom to appoint as attorney general someone of Asian Pacific Islander (API) identity to restore “trust” with law enforcement. The Golden State has the largest population of Asian Americans in the country.
“There has been an unprecedented level of organizing in the API community since the beginning of this pandemic,” says California Assembly Member David Chiu of San Francisco, one of those pressuring the governor. Incidents have “skyrocketed” around the country, and “this has motivated an entire generation of Asian American activists that we’ve never seen before.”
Although law enforcement have said the man arrested in the Atlanta shootings cited sex addiction as a motive, it’s clear that he targeted Asian spas – and Asian Americans nationwide are seeing this as a galvanizing moment.
Pandemic as a driver
As early as February last year, at the start of the pandemic, Asian American lawmakers and advocates had already been warning of a potential rise in xenophobia and attacks against Asian Americans from a virus originating in China. They blame President Donald Trump for fanning the flames with misinformation and inflammatory language, calling COVID-19 the “China virus” and another racist slur for the disease.
Last March, three experienced community activists and experts in California formed Stop AAPI Hate to collect personal accounts of hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The nonprofit has reported more than 3,700 instances nationwide between March 2020 and February 2021, some of which can be read on its website. They range from verbal harassment (68%) to physical assault (11%). In its report, it notes that women are 2.3 times more likely than men to report these disturbing and frightening incidents. Experts say the numbers are just the tip of the iceberg.
David Lee credits this group with unlocking stories from thousands of “ordinary people” who otherwise might not have said anything due to a cultural and historical aversion to speaking up. “They’re realizing, it’s not just me,” says Mr. Lee, executive director of the Chinese American Voters Education Committee. 
He has his own account. Last year, when he ran for supervisor in his San Francisco neighborhood, he received racist emails that had nothing to do with his policy positions and was accused on the Nextdoor app of being an agent for mainland China. Windows were broken and graffiti sprayed on restaurants that featured his signs.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Asian Americans constitute 5.9% of the total U.S. population. That may seem small, but this is the fastest-growing major ethnic group in the country. It’s also a highly diverse population, with the term encompassing significant religious, cultural, economic, educational, and political differences among people who stem from at least 19 countries. Adding Pacific Islanders brings the total to 6.1 percent.
Some of them come from countries with a history of deep-seated enmity. Think India and Pakistan. Mainland China and Taiwan. South Korea and Japan. If you are a fan of the Netflix series “Kim’s Convenience,” a sitcom about a Korean Canadian family that runs a convenience store in Toronto, you will recall that Mr. Kim has not forgotten – or forgiven – Japan’s annexation of his homeland (1910-45).
But Mr. Lee and others say that unlike the past – for instance, the 1992 rioting in Los Angeles’ Koreatown – today’s violence is not targeted at any specific ethnicity. He points to viral videos and media accounts of brutal, and sometimes fatal, attacks on people of Chinese, Filipino, Korean, and Thai descent.
All in this together
“The situation has become so apparent, and so self-evident to everybody that we’re all in this together. And we have reached a tipping point where many of the intramural competitions, and intramural friction, that may have existed in the past has melted away in the face of the larger threat to the entire community,” he says. “Whether you are rich or poor, whether you live in the city or a gated community, you are not safe from racism and hatred.”
Indeed, many people, particularly older individuals, say they are afraid to go out. In some places, volunteers are coming forward to protect them.
“It’s a Pan Asian American movement,” says Dr. Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University and a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate. He has seen leaders from different ethnic groups, including South Asians and members from the Muslim community, turning up in support. And that’s because they had gone through similar experiences, such as confronting Islamophobia post-9/11. “We’re building on their wisdom and experience to address the anti-Asian hate.”
A rain-swept vigil in New York
That unity was evident at an evening vigil of about 100 people in the Queens borough of New York on March 18. People of all races and ages – and backgrounds from East Asian to South Asian – braved cold rain, holding candles and glowsticks as traffic roared past and trains rumbled overhead. They listened to a prayer, and the names of the Atlanta victims known so far: Delaina Ashley Yaun. Xiaojie Tan. Daoyou Feng. Hyeon Jeong Park. Julie Park. Paul Andre Michels. 
“For us to be here is actually sad and unnecessary. We shouldn’t be doing any sort of event like this,” says Jason Molina, who came to the vigil with a friend. Mr. Molina moved to the United States from the Philippines 12 years ago. “Racism has been around so long that it’s become such a regular thing that people are like, it’s normal so we don’t really have to talk about it,” says Mr. Molina. “But we have to talk about it ... because if we set it aside, other people will think it’s OK for us.”
While it’s important to celebrate the diversity of the Asian American community, they also need to come together as one, says Julie Won, a first-generation Korean American who co-organized the vigil with Steven Raga, a Filipino American. Both are running for the New York City Council. “We need to protect each other even though you and I may not be from the same country,” says Ms. Won.
Solutions start with education
Leaders say the demand of the hour is to better educate the public about the causes and effects of discrimination and verbal and physical attacks on API people. The need is also, they say, to increase efforts to organize politically and run for office, and to bring more API representation to film and other media, including multidimensional characters that move beyond stereotypes.
“The most important thing ... is to educate the general public and policymakers that this isn’t new to our community,” says Cynthia Choi, another of the co-founders of Stop AAPI Hate. Another priority is to aid victims. It’s a complex issue, she says, including that “not every incident that involves a member of another race is a hate crime.”
In times of crisis, drivers of violence and crime have to do with poverty – the scramble for affordable housing and other basic needs, a condition that cuts across racial and ethnic groups, she explains. But the “myth of the model minority” – the conventional view of Asian Americans as successful, highly educated, and wealthy – hides this struggle, and adds a sense of incredulity that this population experiences racism at all.
“It’s really had a deleterious effect on our ability to talk about our experiences,” Ms. Choi says.
History of stereotypes
Part of the education process has to do with the history of the API community in the U.S. that has fed racism, say community leaders and activists. This week California’s Board of Education unanimously approved an ethnic studies course curriculum – a controversial issue – even while the state Legislature considers making a high school ethnic studies class a graduation requirement.
Today’s stereotypes – of API people as foreigners, fungible, submissive, unfair competitors, and a model minority – come from the past, says Jerry Kang, an expert on Asian American communities and law professor at the UCLA School of Law.
The record includes the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 that barred Chinese immigrants – a law that lasted well into the mid-20th century – and internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. “The past is not the past,” he says. 
Professor Kang says Asian Americans are trying to confront a question of power. “If your own elders are being beaten up randomly and you can’t do anything about it, what does that mean for any group? It feels like you lack power.” Two places where power makes a much bigger difference, he says, are in politics and, broadly speaking, the media.
In Congress, for instance, the API community makes up only 3.2% of Senate and House members – underrepresented compared with its population. But the numbers have been growing, from seven in 2001 to 17 this year. As voters, API people surged to the polls in 2020 and played a key role in tipping Senate races in Georgia to Democrats while also helping two GOP Korean American women from California take back Democratic seats in the House.
Politicians, whether at the national or local level, have the spotlight to highlight issues and make change. In March, Democratic Rep. Grace Meng of New York introduced a nonbinding resolution calling on all public officials to condemn and denounce anti-Asian sentiments in any form, and for law enforcement to investigate all forms of hate crime. 
Calls for change at Justice Department
Today, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris took that to heart as they visited with API leaders in Atlanta – and Mr. Biden urged Congress to pass hate-crime legislation. Earlier this week, the president ordered flags at half-mast in honor of the shooting victims. Last week, Congresswoman Meng and Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Democrat from Hawaii, announced they were reintroducing hate crime legislation that would dedicate an official at the Justice Department to review and prioritize hate crimes reported to all levels of government, and, among other things, set up a way for people to report hate crimes and other incidents in multiple languages online.
Celebrity power can also be transformative, says Professor Kang. This year’s Oscar nominations are the most diverse in history, with nine of the 20 acting nominees having ethnic-minority backgrounds. Steven Yeun is the first Asian American to be nominated for lead actor in Lee Isaac Chung’s movie “Minari,” about a Korean father who moves his family to an Arkansas farm in the 1980s. Mr. Chung has also been nominated for best director along with Chloé Zhao, the first woman of color to be nominated for directing (in “Nomadland”).
But here, too, progress for the API community is painfully slow. As an actor, Daniel Dae Kim seemed to encompass both the political and media worlds when he testified at the congressional hearing this week about a pollster telling him that Asian Americans are “statistically insignificant” in polling models.
“Statistically insignificant means we literally don’t matter,” he said.
From the voices being raised, including his own, it looks like the API community – and many others – are determined to change that.

"Police unresponsive, Say Asian American Victims of Hate Crimes","Sohrabji, Sunita",Others,2021-03-11,"Story from Ethnic Media ServicesBy SUNITA SOHRABJI/EMS Contributing Editor
On Feb. 25 evening, a man scaled the wall of the 117-year-old Higashi Honganji Buddist Temple temple in Los
Angeles County’s ‘Little Tokyo’ neighborhood and set fire to two wooden lanterns at the entrance to the temple,
then knocked two metal lanterns off their stands, and finally threw a rock that shattered a plate glass window,
as documented in surveillance camera footage.
No one was hurt, said Bishop Noriaki Ito, who serves as the temple’s head priest. Speaking at the “LA vs. Hate –
Stop AAPI Hate Press Conference” press briefing March 8 morning, Ito said he does not yet know whether the
incident will be investigated as a hate crime.
“Our immediate response was anger and hurt. But then we leaned on our Buddhist teachings to find
compassion,” said the bishop, adding: “We are working to create a community of friends.”
The vandalism at the temple is the most recent of a string of anti Asian American incidents which have been
sweeping the country over the past year. The web portal Stop AAPI Hate, an initiative of the Asian Pacific Policy
and Planning Council, has logged 250 incidents in Los Angeles County over the past 12 months.
Nationwide, over 2,800 hate incidents — including violent attacks against elderly Asian Americans — have been
reported on the Stop AAPI Hate portal. Advocates at the briefing said that number represented an under-count: most anti-Asian hate incidents go unreported.
On March 9, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted on a motion to expand the LA vs Hate initiative
and the Rapid Response Network, both of which support victims of hate crimes and incidents with support and
resources, including mental health counseling. The County has established the 211 hotline, which allows victims
to immediately call for help. The motion is sponsored by LA County Supervisor Hilda Solis.
“The situation has got worse over the past year. The person with the loudest bullhorn has mocked our
community,” said Solis at the March 8 press conference, adding that the 211 hotline has reported more than
800 hate incidents in LA County. “The vast majority of hate crimes go unreported,” she said.
LA County Supervisor Holly Mitchell, who also attended the press conference, said: “Just like COVID, hate has
spread rapidly. It’s disheartening to see women, children, the elderly, and even health care workers who have
put themselves on the front lines for us, are being targeted.”
Shelly Shen, a long-time resident of West Covina, California — the bucolic burb which served as the backdrop
for Rachel Bloom’s comedy series “Crazy Ex Girlfriend” — said she lived in a “wonderful community” that had
nonetheless experienced hate. Over the past year, one nearby family has kept up a persistent attack on her
family and her neighbors.
Shen was bitten by the family’s dog, when out on a walk with her dog; the racist family set up a fight between
the two dogs, she said. “They told me they were going to eat my dog,” said Shen, who still suffers scars from
the dog bites.
Law enforcement were not supportive, until Shen got LA vs. Hate involved. “They brought us law enforcement
help and emotional support,” said Shen. “We no longer felt like we were alone.”
“Don’t think this problem will go away if we ignore it: it won’t. Only together will we come out of this dark time,”
said Shen.
Law enforcement was also unresponsive for Hong Lee, a young resident of Los Angeles. Lee had gone into a
restaurant to pick up food. A man approached her, handed her a card, and invited her to lunch. When she
declined, noting that she was married, the man started up a seemingly unending volley of verbal, racist abuse.
The staff at the restaurant would not help. Lee phoned 911. Police officers arriving at the scene cited the lack of
a crime and did not take a police report. “There was a lack of empathy and compassion,” said Lee, adding later
that she continues to suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and was afraid to leave her house for several
months.
Lee shared a video of the incident on her social media pages: five other women, who had faced the same abuse
by the same man, came forward. The LAPD subsequently apologized to Lee and took her report.
Lee advised people to take a video, if possible, and to attempt to de-escalate the situation. She asked people
who witness a hate crime to speak to the offender, and also to provide emotional support. “People have had
acid thrown at them; faces have been slashed,” she stated emotionally.
Other speakers at the press conference were: Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón; Robin S.
Toma, Executive Director of the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations, and Assistant Director of
the Los Angeles County department of Workforce Development, Aging and Community Services; Manjusha
Kulkarni, Executive Director, Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, and representative of StopAAPIHate; and
Fredrick Sykes, former Sheriff’s deputy, Mayor and City Councilmember of West Covina and currently a
commissioner of the LACCHR.

'No one should live in fear for who they are',"Ley, Ana",Others,2021-03-21,"Like many Virginians of Asian descent, Petula Moy followed last week's news from Georgia with a mix of grief, frustration and fear of what could come next.
Eight people, six of them Asian women, were shot dead by a white gunman who targeted three spas Tuesday evening in the Atlanta area. A law enforcement official said that in the killer's words, his actions were ""not racially motivated"" but caused by his ""sexual addiction.""
That framing, Moy said, was dangerous.
""So are you going to investigate whether it's racially motivated or do you already know it's not racially motivated and you're just going to stop there?"" she said in a phone call, voicing concern that investigators seemingly absolved the shooter of bigotry and accused his victims of having ties to sex work without any evidence.
""It's demeaning,"" said Moy, the founder and president of the Asian American Alliance, a nonprofit community outreach group based in Virginia Beach. ""For the Asian community to hear that, you know, it's not comforting.""
Racism against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders is complex and has remained historically invisible, according to guidance from the Asian American Journalists Association. It includes a long history of hypersexualization of Asian women rooted in Westernized and colonial perceptions of Asia.
Attacks against people of Asian descent have spiked after the Trump administration repeatedly emphasized China's connection to
the COVID-19 pandemic.
A report released Tuesday - the same day of the attacks - revealed nearly 3,800 hate incidents reported against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders nationwide over the last year, according to the California-based nonprofit Stop AAPI Hate. Women of Asian descent have reported 2.3 times more incidents of violence than men of Asian descent.
Stop AAPI Hate was created to prevent discrimination during the coronavirus pandemic. The group collects data on hate and harassment incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States.
""Everybody is emphasizing the shooting, but there are tons and tons of everyday incidents where people are facing harassment and so forth,"" said Professor Deenesh Sohoni, director of the Asian Pacific Islander American studies program at the College of William & Mary.
""That everyday thing also needs to be given weight. This is something that is happening regularly during this time period.""
Professor Qiu Jin, the director of Old Dominion University's Institute of Asian Studies, said even before the pandemic, she had been used to slurs, funny looks and laughter from strangers. Now, she fears for her safety every time she leaves home.
""My husband kept telling me, 'No, don't go out by yourself. Do not go out by yourself or even drive by yourself,' "" Jin said. ""More people need to be aware that this kind of discrimination against Asian Americans exists in the United States.""
Jin said she hopes people in the Asian American and Pacific Islander community will grow louder about the racism they endure so people will better understand ""the pain and the suffering of this group."" She stressed that journalists and politicians have a duty to faithfully tell their stories and avoid inflammatory rhetoric, such as former President Donald Trump's characterization of COVID-19 as ""the China virus.""
""We need to keep raising awareness while at the same time condemning the violence which continues to be directed toward AAPI bodies and bodies of color,"" Luisa Igloria, an ODU professor who specializes in Filipino American literature, wrote in an email.
""I'm angry that the Atlanta incident (and others like it in the past) continues to be portrayed in the media as merely a result of the shooter's 'having a bad day;' and as a result of his having some kind of 'sex addiction' (this latter - is practically the same thing as blaming the victims).""
Across Virginia, public officials of Asian descent have denounced the attacks.
""My Grandfather often endured discrimination and hate because he was Filipino, even though he served this country in the military. He told me about a time when it was common to see signs that said 'No Dogs or Filipinos,' and I always thought that I would never see this kind of hate in my life,"" Virginia Beach Del. Kelly Convirs-Fowler, a Democrat, said in a prepared statement. ""No one should live in fear for who they are, or where they come from.""
Former Williamsburg city council member Benny Zhang - the city's first Asian American elected to office - shared his condolences and condemned xenophobia targeting Asian Americans.
""The alarming trends of the rising violence against the Asian Pacific American community has propagated fear and heightened awareness in all corners of our country,"" Zhang wrote in an email. ""We all have a responsibility to make sure our neighbors are safe and to stand together against all forms of injustice.""
Former Newport News council member Rob Coleman echoed those concerns and said he is ""deeply saddened and angered"" by the attacks.
""The shootings in Atlanta are a shocking act of gun violence but also appear to be an act of hate,"" Democratic Congressman Bobby Scott tweeted on Wednesday.
""While my heart goes out to the victims' loved ones, I join in the chorus of voices standing with the AAPI community. We must condemn hate and bigotry in all forms. #StopAsianHate""

"Op Ed: If we want to stop anti-Asian hate, we can’t sit this one out","Son, Lisa K",Others,2021-03-09,"By Lisa K SonThe recent attacks on Asian Americans are disturbing, but nothing new. Even before the
pandemic, Asian Americans were routinely assaulted, spat upon, and told to “go back home,” but seldom chose
to report these incidents. The pandemic has simply made visible what had been largely invisible, though
skepticism remains as to whether these truly qualify as racially motivated attacks.
If we in the Asian community want to reduce our exposure to hate crimes, we must overcome our tendency to
remain silent. We must let the world know what we were experiencing long before COVID-19 began making
headlines.
As a researcher who studies the self-reflective process of metacognition and someone of Asian descent, it’s clear
to me that underreporting of racially motivated attacks on Asian Americans happens, at least in part, because
the victims are caught between American individualism and Asian collectivism. Too often, the Asian self prevails
and the victim fails to report the crime for the “good” of the group.
Metacognition, which develops in childhood, refers to our ability to understand and reflect on our own thought
processes. It has also been identified as a form of “privileged access,” where my own thoughts are private,
known only to me. Asian Americans tend to embrace this privacy. But why? For many immigrants, assimilation
is a life-long goal. Given differences in our appearances, habits, and speech, our strategy for successful
assimilation has been anonymity. We even refuse to let our facial expressions betray our emotions. A high
school teacher once announced that my nickname would be “poker face.” At the time, this didn’t feel like an insult; I took pride in the accomplishment of bluffing, and thus assimilating.
In America, people want access to others’ personal stories, including their challenges and hardships. Intimate
details about people’s lives, including their private thoughts, are commodified in published memoirs. When I was
writing my book on metacognition (in Korean), I was told, “Don’t get personal!” When I (cautiously) posted on
social media about my issues with the former administration, I heard the inevitable, “Be careful.” And, now, as I
write this piece, I put myself at risk of hearing what I fear most: “Sit this one out.” But I can’t sit this out
anymore. I, too, have seen the videos of the attacks, and it hits too close to home. The faces of the victims are
our parents, our grandparents, and our elders. The victims are those who have sacrificed their own culture to
help us find acceptance into the American culture. We need to speak up.
But it’s still not easy. Like most Asians, I am embarrassingly comfortable behind a mask. In February of 2020,
“anonymous me” stuck out like a sore thumb as I got on the train after work. I was the only Asian in sight, and
the only person wearing a mask. A few weeks later, even after discussions of mask-wearing had begun, I was
the only masked individual in my local, very crowded, Shop-Rite. At the check-out, I told the person behind me
to please move back a little. She refused and scowled at me. I spoke to no one about this, but have not set foot
inside a supermarket since.
The pandemic has made the particularities of Asian American culture more salient. While anonymity was once
our superpower, it’s now our curse. As the earliest and most consistent maskers, we become outsiders,
foreigners, and carriers of deadly diseases like the “Kung Flu virus.” At the same time, skepticism about our
condition is on the rise. Stereotypically, we seem not to suffer in the classroom or in the economy. We tend not
to complain, so attacks on us can’t really be that serious, can they?
What remains unseen is easily believed not to exist, and while we cling to our anonymity the abuse remains
invisible. We cannot address anti-Asian violence in America until we first “see” that it exists. This means opening
up collectively about our individual experiences with racism. But it also means understanding and battling the
racism faced by others in our society, including racism that comes from within our community. It means finding
ways in which to increase our nation’s cultural intelligence. From a metacognitive perspective, I want us to find
ways to balance our Asian and American identities, which starts with trusting ourselves. I will begin with myself.
As I don my mask and reflect, I pledge to make myself more visible in the fight against hate.About the Author:

Beacon of human rights dims in US,None,Others,2021-03-22,"The shootings in Atlanta on Tuesday have sparked a public outcry condemning the violence against Asian Americans in the United States, with massive protests taking place in many US cities.
Local police arrested a 21-year-old white man from Georgia for the shooting incidents at three massage parlors in the Atlanta metropolitan area, which killed eight people, six Asians and two whites.
Meanwhile, a video showing an elderly Chinese woman, with one eye bleeding after being punched in the face, fearlessly fighting back against the burly middle-aged white man who attacked her on the street in San Francisco, has gone viral online.
These incidents have highlighted a grim reality: The US, the self-claimed champion of human rights, is, in fact, a dungeon of hate crimes and racial discrimination.
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, media reports and opinion polls in the US have revealed a rising number of crimes against Asians in the US. According to a report issued by the Stop Asian American Pacific Islander Hate, a coalition of Asian American and Pacific Islander groups, Asian Americans in the US have reported nearly 3,800 hate-related incidents in less than a year.
The report shows the types of discrimination range from verbal harassment and physical assaults, to online harassment and civil rights violations.
While the death of African American George Floyd last year and the subsequent mass protests exposed the US' protracted, systematic and serious racial discrimination, the rising number of attacks on Asian Americans should draw equal attention and serious soul-searching in US society.
Admittedly, racial inequality has long plagued the US and tarnished its reputation as a ""melting pot"" of different immigrant groups. But, the rise of white supremacist ideologies in recent years and irresponsible US politicians who have used the pandemic to spread biased sentiments have fanned the flames of racial discrimination in the US.
Former US president Donald Trump and members of his administration repeatedly referred to the novel coronavirus as the ""China virus"" and ""Wuhan virus"" in a bid to deflect public criticism over their woeful handling of the pandemic, and this fueled hatred against Asian Americans.
With its own house in a mess, the US out of arrogance and hypocrisy, has continued to apply a double standard in the world pointing an accusing finger at other countries' human rights and democracy.
Before accusing others of abusing human rights, it should get its own house in order.
Hence, the onus is on the current US administration to cultivate a harmonious social atmosphere in the US where the rights of people from different backgrounds are equally protected.

'Chinese virus' instructor out at UC: He won't be asked back after 'poor judgment',"Mitchell, Madeline",Others,2021-03-23,"The University of Cincinnati did not renew a contract with an instructor accused of calling COVID-19 ""the Chinese virus"" in an email to a student, according to university spokesperson M.B. Reilly.
The university launched an investigation after third-year engineering student Evan Sotzing emailed then College of Engineering and Applied Science adjunct instructor John Ucker in September that he would have to miss an in-person lab due to possible COVID-19 exposure.
In emails forwarded to The Enquirer, Sotzing wrote that he had been told not to attend any in-person classes for two weeks.
""For students testing positive for the chinese (sic) virus, I will give no grade,"" Ucker responded.
Sotzing posted a screenshot of the email on social media, which received nearly 200,000 interactions.
Shortly afterward, college Dean John Weidner said he was ""looking into it"" and referred the matter for review to the university's Office of Equal Opportunity and Access.
That department handles inquiries regarding discrimination, harassment or retaliation based on disability, race, color, religion, national origin and other identities, according to its website.
""These types of xenophobic comments and stigmatizations around location or ethnicity are more than troubling,"" Weidner wrote to The Enquirer at the time.
""We can better protect and care for all when we speak about COVID-19 with both accuracy and empathy – something we should all strive for.""
Neither Ucker nor Weidner could be reached for comment Monday.
Increased numbers of Asian Americans have reported harassment and even physical assaults amid political rhetoric blaming China for the pandemic from former President Donald Trump and others.
Locally, the family of Oriental Wok Chinese restaurants in Fort Mitchell and Hyde Park spoke out in a social media post about racist, violent threats they said they've endured this past year.
Ucker was put on administrative leave with pay in September pending the outcome of the investigation, according to an email from Weidner to Ucker.
In November, Weidner released a statement regarding the investigation and said Ucker's leave would continue for the rest of the fall semester, at least.
""As an isolated reference, the term 'Chinese virus' did not meet the threshold to be designated harassment,"" Weidner said. ""However, it did represent poor judgment, caused offense to members of our community, and distracted from the learning environment.""
According to Ucker's personnel file, he had taught at UC since 1996.
A letter sent in August states Ucker was offered an adjunct position in the engineering college effective Aug. 24 through Dec. 12. His compensation for the semester was documented at $3,600.
Reilly told The Enquirer recently that Ucker's contract as an adjunct was not renewed. Ucker is still listed as an adjunct instructor on UC's website.
UC President Neville Pinto released a statement March 17 regarding anti-Asian rhetoric nationwide.
""Hate and violence against our Asian American communities is rising and reprehensible,"" said Pinto, who was born in India and served 26 years on the faculty at the engineering college in his first stint at UC.
""As a nation, we must do more to abolish bigotry and protect and celebrate difference. As a campus community, we must show our strength in unity by standing with our Asian American students, faculty, staff and alumni to renounce all forms of hate and violence.
""The urgency has never been greater. Each of us must answer the call to act.""

Asian Iowans say violence 'terrifying': Advocates: US history of racism continues today,Andrea May Sahouri,Others,2021-03-20,"Mira Yusef was flooded with terror, anger, frustration and grief as she watched from her Des Moines home while the news of Tuesday's shooting rampage in Atlanta unfolded.
Robert Aaron Long, 21, of Woodstock, Georgia, is accused of opening fire at three spas in the Atlanta area, killing eight people – most of whom were Asian women. Authorities identified the victims on Friday as Soon C. Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, Yong A. Yue, Delaina Ashley Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Tan and Daoyou Feng.
Atlanta police say it's too soon to label the killings as a hate crime, despite a national outcry to do so from experts, activists and Asian Americans across the country.
While Long claimed the killings were motivated by a self-proclaimed sex addiction, many Asians and Pacific Islanders nationwide, including here in Iowa, have pointed to the carnage as yet another example of a rise in violent attacks against Asian Americans. They view the attacks as fueled by racism and xenophobia during the COVID-19 pandemic and anti-China rhetoric conveyed by former President Donald Trump and other prominent conservatives.
In Iowa, recent reports of anti-Asian racism have mainly taken the form of increased microaggressions against people perceived to be from China, where the initial outbreak of COVID-19 was first disclosed in January 2020. But Tuesday's killings were not the first time Yusef, who is Filipina, has had to join in collectively grieving a violent attack against her community.
Yusef said Thursday that, while the increase of violence against Asians and Pacific Islanders is ""terrifying,"" it's worth noting that racism against those groups is nothing new. Rather, the increase in anti-Asian attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic has only highlighted deeply rooted historical and transnational racism against Asians and Pacific Islanders and violence against Asian women, she said.
Yusef cited many examples, including the U.S. Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882; American colonialism in Asian countries; domestic and sexual violence due to harmful, hypersexual stereotypes of ""docile, submissive"" Asian women; and, during the pandemic, the stabbing of three members of an Asian American family – including two small children – in Texas because the suspect thought they were ""Chinese and infecting people with the coronavirus,"" according to an FBI intelligence report.
""There is a lack of analysis – we cannot forget that anti-Asian sentiment is also deeply connected with anti-Blackness, xenophobia, white supremacy,"" said Yusef, co-founder of the Des Moines-based organization Monsoon Asians and Pacific Islanders in Solidarity.
""If (authorities) will just say, 'he is a sex addict or he had a bad day,' then we ignore the right questions: Why would he choose a massage parlor with low-wage Asian women employees? As Asian women, we are seen as invisible, submissive. It's like we're nothing.""
Advocates: Microaggressions, racist attacks against Asian Iowans under-reported
Just one month into the pandemic, Iowa's Asians and Pacific Islanders were already sharing stories among each other, and publicly, of increased racism against their communities and a growing fear of anti-Asian violence both locally and nationally.
Asian Iowans previously shared with the Register information about microaggressions they had experienced. Some examples appeared explicit and included individuals being yelled at with ""coronavirus,"" a white couple leaving a grocery line to avoid standing next to an Asian American mother buying a birthday cake for her son, and a white woman leaving a Chinese restaurant after asking the owners if they were Chinese.
Other examples were more subtle, such as tense looks or stares.
In 2019, there were 29,370 Asians and Pacific Islanders in the Des Moines metro area, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, or 4.2% of the population. That was up from 3.7% in 2015.
In 2017, 2.6% of Iowa's total population was Asian, according to the State Data Center, with Des Moines, Ames and Iowa City having the largest numbers. That percentage is projected to grow to 4.4% by 2050, the center reported.
Nu Huynh, executive director of the Iowa Asian Alliance, has been keeping tabs on potential racism and xenophobia tied to COVID-19 with an online form people can fill out for complaints. Since the start of the pandemic, she has been encouraging the community to report any type of racism or xenophobia, from microaggressions to violent attacks.
So far, she's received only a handful of complaints, Huynh said, the most violent being an egg thrown at an Asian Iowan.
""We just have been very fortunate here in Iowa that we have not seen the level of violence that we are seeing around the world,"" Huynh told the Register, acknowledging that it's possible there could be attacks and microaggressions that haven't been reported.
Des Moines police data shows that aggravated assaults against Asian victims decreased from 33 incidents in 2019 to 24 in 2020. The Des Moines Police Department was still compiling data of other crimes against Asians, including harassment, as of Thursday night.
Last year, the Iowa Civil Rights Commission took nine discrimination complaints from Iowans who identify as Asian. None has been filed in 2021.
""There's probably a lot of people that are experiencing (racism and xenophobia), but they're not saying anything,"" Huynh said. Obstacles to filing reports include fear of retaliation and victims not believing that will make a difference, she said.
Nationally, more than 3,800 incidents of racism and xenophobia against Asians and Pacific Islanders were recorded between March 2020 and February by Stop AAPI Hate, a San Francisco-based reporting center.
The majority of discrimination reported involved verbal harassment and shunning, according to a Stop AAPI Hate report, which found that discrimination mostly occurred at businesses, followed by public streets.
Further, the report indicates, women reported hate incidents 2.3 times more than men.
'The solidarity shown
has been beautiful'
Despite the terror and grief, Yusef said that, in Des Moines, the ""solidarity shown has been beautiful"" in response to the Atlanta killings and increased concerns about racism and xenophobia against Asians and Pacific Islanders.
Apart from the community reaching out and checking in on her, Yusef said her organization, Monsoon Asians and Pacific Islanders, has received many donations, which she plans to send directly to the victims' families and coworkers.
Organizations such as the NAACP of Des Moines have released statements in solidarity, as well.
Additionally, Huynh has said she's seen a lot of solidarity both in business partnerships and in rallying the community to support Asian and Pacific Islander businesses in Iowa.
Lucky Lotus, which serves Laotian, Vietnamese and Chinese specialties in Des Moines' Woodland Heights neighborhood, announced Thursday morning that the restaurant plans to donate 25% of its proceeds through the end of the week to the Iowa Asian Alliance.
""We lead with love and kindness, but we cannot stay silent. Uniting Asian, Asian American, and Pacific Islander communities to foster growth and development will lead to a more vibrant and prosperous community, which we believe will in turn help prevent violent acts of hate from corrupting the most vulnerable in our neighborhoods,"" the restaurant wrote in a statement.
And on Saturday, the community will come together for a vigil from noon to 4 p.m. at the Pappajohn Sculpture Park to remember the lives of the eight killed in Atlanta, as well as to pay respect to other Asians and Pacific Islanders who have experienced racism and xenophobia.

United States: Asian Frontline Medics in US Face Hate Amid COVID-19,None,Others,2021-03-30,"While the past year's battle with COVID-19 has been grueling for health care workers across America, the challenge has been compounded for Asian medical professionals, who have also had to work amid a wave of pandemic-inspired anti-Asian attacks.
The past year, it was just so many different mixed emotions between the pandemic... [and] issuesregardingracialinjustice. All that put together made last year very different from other years, said Austin Chiang, a doctor whose parents emigrated from Taiwan to the U.S. 10 years before he was born in Irvine, California.
On the same day that six Asian American women were slain with two other individuals in Atlanta last week, the advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate released a report that cited 3,795 hate incidents targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders between March 19, 2020, and Feb. 28, 2021.
More than 500 of the incidents were recorded since the beginning of this year.
COVID-19 was first detected in humans in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. Spreading globally since then, it has felled more than 548,000 people in the U.S., where there have been more than 30 million confirmed cases, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.
In 16 of the most populous U.S. cities, attacks on Asian Americans increased in 2020 by almost 150% over the previous year, according to data compiled by California State University's Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.
That has made the past year a time of reflection for Chiang, who holds a master's degree in public health from Harvard University and an M.D. from Columbia University He has been active on social media countering COVID-19 misinformationas the chief medical social media officer for 14 hospitals operated by Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and founder of the Association for Healthcare Social Media (AHSM).
The death of George Floyd, an African American man who died while in police custody in May in Minnesota, and the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement, mademerethink a lot of things about... ways we can try to incorporate...equity around my workplace and making surethat othersfeel like they are treated fairly and are seen and heard, the gastroenterologist told VOA Mandarin.
It's definitely been jarring and a bit hard to reconcile because at the same time feeling ... we're being judged not for our skill but for our appearance, and certainly that's something that affects so many different people.
The funniest thing was a Caucasian gentleman called me, like, 'Eggrolls,' said VannthathMan, 42, of Haymarket, Virginia, an ICU nurse at Inova Fairfax Hospital who studied nursing at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia.
I don't take these things personally ... He may have that thought in the back of his mind but if he was not medicated, if he was not confused, he would not have said it.But it doesn't make him right to think that way.
Born in Battambang, Cambodia, Man was bullied to tears and outcast during his first years of school after he arrived in the U.S. in 1989 at the age of 12 with his family. At the time, Man told VOA Khmer he thought it might be a good idea if someone were to help ...maybe I wouldn't have the suicidal thoughts, maybe I didn't have to go through such a hard time. So that's why I went into the help industry or (became) a nurse because I want to help people.
On a day when four of his six COVID-19 patients died in the ICU, Man turned to the self-care methods created for himself as a teen. Culturally, our family (was) not very open on talking about certain things. ... A lot of time (I dealt) with things by myself. ... So with that day, I thought ... about what positive attributes you have, what positive things you give to the community.
Asians, U.S.- and Asian-born combined, are disproportionately represented in health care given their numbers in the overall population, according to figures from the Migration Policy Institute and the U.S. Census.
Of the foreign-born health care workers in the U.S., 40% come from Asia.
After learning English, he enrolled in an accelerated nursing program at Chamberlain University in Downers Grove, Illinois, condensing four years of study into 30 months. He graduated in 2017 with a bachelor's degree.
It was tough, Conners told VOA Indonesia of his intense program. Now an ICU nurse in the hospital where he returned to health, he treats African Americans,Hispanics,Asians, Middle Easterners, Caucasians, everyone the same. They are my patients.
His first COVID-19 patients were in their70s and 80s, but now they are younger people, in their 20s and 30s.
It's really sad. It's really depressing, Connors said. And when I go out from work,when I (leave) work, I see people in the street outside ... not wearing masks orthey're just not doing social distancing. ... it (breaks) my heart.
If only those on the street could see inside of this hospital, people ... dying, said Conners, who would like to return to Indonesia to work with a local clinic, buildan outpatient clinicand try to help my people.
Nursing during the pandemic has taught Conners the value of self-care, which includes taking care of my mind, my mentalwell-being, said Conners, who estimates he has witnessed 100 patients die from COVID-19. Sometimes I feel likeCOVIDjust beat me. ... OrI feel like I just lost in a battle withCOVID.
Wengang Zhang, 67, was born in China's Sichuan province, and arrived in the U.S. in 1988 with a medical degree he'd earned from what is now the Chongqing University of Medical Sciences. A primary care doctor, he completed his U.S. training in 1999 with a residency at the University of California-Los Angeles Medical Center.
Zhang told VOA Mandarin the biggest challenge he faced to be able to practice medicine in the U.S. was definitely the language but another big difference is the system, insurance kind of stuff. I had never heard about ... medical insurance, or Medicare, Medicaid.
He practices at the Springhill Medical Group in Contra Costa County, east of San Francisco, where he treats patients who are white, they are Black,Spanish orPacificIslander.
He told VOA Mandarin he admitted the county's first COVID-19 patient after being called to a local emergency room.
I can tell you exactly the day ...March1st. ... Everything, the data, matched whatever we were learning from China's experience.
The county's first COVID-19 patient turned out to be one of Zhang's own, a healthy young guy, and he had no idea where he got it.
After the examination, Zhang left the hospital, opened all his car's windows, drove home, parked, stripped and rushed to take a shower without stopping to talk to his wife.
It's actually in my over 20-something years of practice, the first time when (I realized) my own life may be in danger because I saw this patient, said Zhang.
According to an investigation by Kaiser Health News and The Guardian, of the 3,561 health care workers who have died on the U.S. front line as of January, 21% were Asian/Pacific Islanders.
One who survived COVID-19 is Tsering Dechen, 28, a Tibetan who arrived in the U.S. in 2010 after finishing high school in Nepal, following her mother's urging to get a good education. After a series of odd jobs, she earned a bachelor's degree in nursing from Lehman College, in New York City, in 2019. She's a progressive care nurse at Elmhurst Health & Hospital in New York City, a job she started weeks before the first COVID-19 cases arrived.
Her workplace is in the heart of Queens, a borough known for a rich diversity of residents from Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, and South and Central America. I feel like Elmhurst Hospital is the best example that one can have on how we all coexist together, said Dechen, who says she's been hearing of violence directed at Asian Americans, in particular an attack on an Asian American doctor.
Why would you attack a person, a single person, just because he's Asian American? she asked. How can you blame a pandemic on just one single person?How canyou show your angst and attack somebody like that?
Every dayIrealize how similar we are, Dechen told VOA Tibetan. Our elderlies, their needs ... you see howmuch of a similarity there (is) ...in these different ethnicities.""
Tien Tan Vo, 44, graduated from Ross University School of Medicine in the West Indies and is now medical directorof VO Medical Center in California's Imperial Valley, an agricultural area bordering Mexico.
He began treating COVID-19 patients last March, when he faced the most difficult days of the pandemic because wedidn't have enough tests at that time. Patients wanted to be tested, and they, of course, ...(were)very anxious, (it's) very, very frightening, they want to know the result right away. ... (It's) very, very stressful, very stressful ...about the testing and the anxiety level of this pandemic.
Vo, who was born in Vietnam'sBinhDinh province, sent the tests to San Diego for processing and told patients they had to wait for the results.
He recalled walking out to the parking lot of his clinic to test one patient who was later diagnosed with COVID-19. I came out with a full PPE (protective personal protective gear), I covered from head to toe because we don't know what's going on with the virus ... and I asked her to lower the window and she started crying and she couldn't talk because she was (out of breath) asshe's gasping for air.
Transferred to the local hospital and then to a San Diego medical center, the patient was ventilated, the family was frantic, then on Day 11, she turned around, suddenly got better on her own, Vo told VOA Vietnamese.
He admitted another patient with symptoms to the hospital, where he was up and walking around after a few hours. The next day, the man couldn't walk and after administering I.V. steroids,an I.V. infusion, and plasma transfusions we couldn't help him at all. Four days after the initial diagnosis, the patient became Vo's first to die of COVID-19.
Vo didn't know what to say to the family,but they were nice enough to call me and inform me, 'DoctorVo,you triedyour best.Don't worry. Don't be sad.' ... They even encouraged me to continue to help other people.
Asian Frontline Medics Face Hate Amid COVID-19
They've had to work amid a wave of pandemic-inspired anti-Asian attacks
I've been a nurse for more than 30 years, I've been through the death and the birth, but this is an unbelievable for me... I did not follow the numbers because it's so discouraging, said AnchaleeDulayathitikul, 55, an intermediate care nurse. She arrived in the U.S. in 2014, after deciding she wanted an American education for her children.
She had opted for a nursing career because her grandfather thought she had a caring nature. Dulayathitikul earned her degree in nursing and midwifery in 1988 from Chiang Mai University in Thailand. More than a quarter century later, she passed all the tests in the battery needed for nursing certification in Maryland on her first sitting.
She works at the University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Medical Center and after a year, she told VOA Thai, I see the flow and I seehow wecantake care of (COVID-19 patients) successfully.
Dulayathitikul plans visit her unwell mother in Thailand once the pandemic, and its travel restrictions retreat. She will return to Maryland for her children and her career because I love my career a lot.
DaruneeRasameloungon, 41, a Bangkok native who arrived in the U.S. in 1991 with her family to join her father who had emigrated ahead of them. She wanted to be an engineer or an FBI agent until she helped care for a cousin after a bus hit him, breaking his arms and legs.
When she decided to pursue nursing, her father told her he couldn't pay for college on what he earned delivering pizza. Working with her high school counselor, Rasameloungon parlayed high grades, volunteer work and school activities into scholarships to pay for all four years at George Mason University's nursing school in Fairfax, Virginia. She graduated in 2001 and is now a progressive care unit nurse technician at Fairfax Hospital, where she has worked since 2008.
It's always hard, this is very sad when you have to wrap someone in the bag, you know, ... theydied by themselves, she told VOA Thai. They have nobody withthem,and their family cannot be with them, (it) is really sad ...todie by yourself. Itis really overwhelming. My God, you feel sorry for them. And it's just, like a reality hit: This . . . can happen to anybody.
Although Rasameloungon intends to continue nursing in the U.S. in part to remain close to her son, she wants to take a long break in Thailand when the pandemic subsides because the COVID (made) me realize that I want to spend more time with my family.
Born in Menifee, California, LimyiHeng, 38, is the child of Cambodian refugees. He spent three years in the Air Force, most of the time in Southern California. But I did a lot of tours all around the United States, which gave me a deep appreciation for the diversity of America.
His Air Force mentor guided himinto a career as a nurse practitioner, and he earned his master's degree in nursing from Columbia University, where he developed a network that informed him early about the spread of COVID-19 in New York City and elsewhere. He works at Redlands Community Hospital and San Gorgonio Memorial Hospital.
The surge of COVID-19 cases began in October and continued through December. There wasn't really a worst moment. I think it was this really, the long hours, the long hours, Heng told VOA Cambodian. For him, the upside at work is being part of a team that includes hospital housekeepers, the logistics people who deliver protective gear and community leaders who provide the right messaging, the right information to drown out the misinformation.
For Conners, similar teamwork 2,600 is what leads to his proudest moments of the pandemic, when patients leave the ICU.This kind of a big accomplishment (is) from the teamwork that we have done.

United States: Hundreds Gather in Seattle to Protest Attacks on Asian Americans,None,Others,2021-03-16,"Hundreds of people gathered in Seattle on Saturday to protest violence against Asian Americans during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
A crowd gathered in Hing Hay Park in the Chinatown-International District of Seattle for a rally and march
condemning attacks against Asian Americans, including elderly members of the community, the Seattle Times
reported.
Former Washington Gov. Gary Locke (D), the country's first Asian American governor, spoke at the rally and
called for an end to violence against Asian American communities.
This violence against Asian Americans, and especially our elderly, has got to stop, Locke said, adding, We cannot
scapegoat, blame Asian Americans for this virus. Hate is a virus.
At the event, King County Executive Dow Constantine, who is married to a Japanese American woman, declared
that he will propose substantial funding for the education and publicity to address racially based hate and bias in
our community in the upcoming budget.
Noriko Nasu, a Japanese American teacher who was attacked along with her boyfriend close to Hing Hay Park
last month, addressed the demonstrators wearing the same outfit she wore during the assault.
She called on authorities to take hate crime more seriously and take more action, according to Seattle station
KOMO 4 TV.
""I don't think the statute or the law is well-written to protect the people and I want hate crime charges to be
heavier, she said.
King County Prosecutor Dan Satterberg wrote last week that the two counts of felony assault against the
suspect in the case, Sean Holdip, would lead to a longer punishment of 12 to 14 months than a hate crime
charge. He noted that the current evidence collected did not seem to be enough to prove a hate crime.
We are ethically bound to only bring cases that we believe can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, he wrote,
adding, We're open to changing the charge if additional evidence is found or if the suspect makes additional
statements.
The rally came as a report released last week concluded that Asian Americans saw a 150 percent increase in
attacks in 2020.
President Joe Biden denounced the rise in violence against Asian Americans in an address last week saying, It's
wrong, it's un-American and it must stop. - FNA

The violence toward the businesses ""is frightening and alarming,"" Chris Chan, an advisory chair for the Asian-American Action Fund Georgia Chapter, told The Washington Post.
Chan said Asian-Americans in Georgia had recently faced ""words yelled at us or threatening gestures and actions"" but ""nothing rising to what we are seeing tonight.""
Police, who arrested Robert Aaron Long, 21, in connection with the shootings, said they had yet to know a motive.
But as the shooting came amid a national surge of racist attacks and threats against Asian-Americans, advocates Tuesday reacted with alarm and police from Seattle to New York ramped up security in Asian American neighbourhoods.

"Amid rising racism toward Asian people, Lawrence residents focus on finding common ground","Lysen, Dylan",Others,2021-03-27,"Derek Kwan, president of the Asian-American Faculty and Staff Council at KU, is pictured at the Lied Center of Kansas, where he is executive director, on Friday, March 26, 2021.; Photo by: Ashley Golledge
For Derek Kwan, the past year has felt similar to what he witnessed almost 20 years ago.
As the coronavirus swept across the world, creating a global pandemic, it also seems to have sparked what Kwan sees as an anti-Asian sentiment, likely because the virus was first discovered in China, which led to derogatory rhetoric from some political leaders.
As someone who had lived in New York City in 2001, Kwan, now the executive director of the Lied Center, said the recent racism toward the Asian American and Pacific Islander community, also known as AAPI, felt very similar to the harmful anti-Muslim sentiment he saw after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.
To help dispel that kind of thinking, Kwan, who has lived in Lawrence since 2014 and is currently the president of the University of Kansas’ Asian and Asian-American Faculty and Staff Council, told the Journal-World he tried to find common ground with others, especially those who haven’t been exposed to much diversity.
Susan Kang, who immigrated to the U.S. from South Korea when she was 10 and has been a Lawrence resident for more than 20 years, said she too believed in helping others better understand that their perceptions of Asians may be incorrect or prejudicial.
“We need to find as a society a way to not only celebrate our differences, but celebrate our commonalities in a way that is productive,” Kwan said. “We all want the best for each other, for our families, for our society. It’s unfortunate when rhetoric can get in the way of that.”
But the recent surge of racism toward the Asian community is now believed to have culminated in national tragedy after a 21-year-old man attacked three spas in shootings in the Atlanta area, killing eight people. Of those eight, six were of Asian descent, according to various news reports.
While there is a public debate about whether the accused killer’s motivations were because of racism toward the AAPI community, Kwan said when he first heard of the shooting, he believed it was a flashpoint for the rising racism toward Asian people in the last year. He noted that a recent study found that hate crimes against the AAPI community have increased significantly.
Kang said her first reaction to the shootings was dismay, but she was not shocked. She said it appeared to be another case of stereotyping, as the killer allegedly had a sex addiction and had frequented the spa locations previously. She said reducing someone, regardless of race, to one dimension made it easier to perpetrate violence against them.
“It’s yet another case of Asian and Asian Americans being reduced to certain stereotypes,” Kang said. “There’s a notion he was looking at these Asian women not as three-dimensional humans, but as sex objects. That’s what he had reduced them down to.”
Kang said she also began thinking of her parents in the Chicago area because of reports of elderly Asians in America being attacked in the streets, which she believes is associated with anti-Asian rhetoric associated with COVID-19.
According to NBC News, the Center for Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, found hate crimes against Asian people increased 150% in 2020, despite the overall number of hate crimes in general falling by 7%.
Since the shooting, other attacks on the AAPI community have occurred elsewhere, including San Francisco, where a 75-year-old Asian woman, Xiao Zhen Xie, fought back her attacker on a street corner, according to NPR. She ended up giving the nearly $1 million that was raised for her in a Gofundme campaign to organizations that fight racism.
Additionally, here in Kansas, state Rep. Rui Xu, the only Asian American lawmaker in the Legislature, said he was recently threatened in a bar in Russell. A man questioned why he was wearing a face mask and threatened to assault him, according to The Associated Press. He also asked if Xu was carrying COVID-19.
“That’s a pretty specific dog whistle at Asian Americans from last year,” Xu, who is Chinese American, told the AP. “Most of the anti-Asian American rhetoric that has happened has had some form of that message.”
Kwan and Kang both noted that racism toward the AAPI community was not new, but has been a long-running issue in American history. They both mentioned the Chinese Exclusion Act in the late 1800s and the U.S. internment camps for Japanese people during World War II.
They both said they have generally not experienced significant acts of racism while living in Lawrence. However, they aren’t strangers to the issue. Kang said she’s experienced what could be described as microaggressions, while Kwan said he had experienced racist incidents while living in North Carolina and Michigan. He said he thought that most, if not all, people in the AAPI community have been targeted by some sort of harassment during their lives.
But when those instances happen, they both also said they have tried to educate the perpetrator rather than ignore it. Kang said she specifically remembers doing that while she was living in Massachusetts, when she overheard a group of young people talking about Asian women, describing them in stereotypical ways. She said she approached the group to tell them she had overheard their descriptions and felt that she needed to explain that they were incorrect and harmful.
“I’m somebody who immediately speaks up,” Kang said. “Every opportunity to educate, I will do so.”
Kwan said he too has tried to educate the people who have perpetrated racism around him to help them understand that what they were doing was harmful. He said everyone has different lived experiences and different perspectives, and it’s important to help others realize that we are all human beings. He said he hoped the spotlight on recent incidents would help others realize the significance of the problem and begin seeing others for their humanity rather than for their race and associated stereotypes.
“Once they see you are just another human being … it can really change a person’s perspective,” Kwan said. “I have always believed that if I can change the perspective of one other person, hopefully that can snowball into creating a society that can not only celebrate common ground, but also celebrate differences.”

Suspect denies race was motivation in Atlanta spa attacks,None,Others,2021-03-18,"ISLAMABAD, March 18 -- A 21-year-old gunman with a ""sex addiction"" has taken responsibility for killing eight people in spas around the US city of Atlanta, but denied a racial motive to the attacks that shook the country's Asian community, police said Wednesday.
Six of the victims of Tuesday night's killings were of Asian origin, exacerbating concerns over a surge in violence targeting the community during the pandemic. Authorities however stressed they had not determined the motive of the shooter, identified as Robert Aaron Long, a white man who is believed to have acted alone.
""The suspect did take responsibility for the shootings,"" Captain Jay Baker of the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office told a news conference.
""This is still early, but he does claim it was not racially motivated,"" the officer added. ""He apparently has an issue, what he considers a sex addiction, and sees these locations as... a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate."" Authorities arrested Long after tracking his phone following a brief pursuit about 150 miles (240 kilometres) from Atlanta, officials said. After he was detained, ""he made a comment... that he was headed to Florida and that he was going to do similar acts in that state,"" Baker said.
Adriana Mejia, niece of one of the victims, said the family was ""devastated"" after her uncle was shot and that they were praying for his recovery.
""We never know when we're at the wrong place at the wrong time because this was so all of a sudden,"" she said.
Violence in the US Vice President Kamala Harris said that while the motive remained unclear, the latest mass shootings spoke ""to a larger issue which is violence in our country."" ""I do want to say to our Asian-American community that we stand with you and understand how this has frightened and shocked and outraged all people,"" Harris said.
Four of the victims were killed at Young's Asian Massage near Acworth, an Atlanta suburb. Police separately confirmed that four women had been killed in attacks on two other spas in the northeast of the city. Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said the normally quiet commuter suburb had experienced few murders and Tuesday's violence was ""a shock to all of us"".
South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported the country's foreign ministry had confirmed that four of the victims were of Korean descent.
The shootings come as reports of attacks against Asian-Americans, primarily elders, have spiked in recent months -- fuelled during the Covid-19 pandemic, activists believe, by talk of the ""Chinese virus"" by former president Donald Trump and others. Former president Barack Obama said on Twitter that while the shooter's motive was not yet clear, ""the identity of the victims underscores an alarming rise in anti-Asian violence that must end."" 'Marginalised minorities' News of the shootings came just hours after the release of a report by the advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate suggested a marked increase in hate crimes against Asia-Americans -- with women disproportionately affected.
In a tally of incidents reported to the group between March 2020 and February this year, almost 70 percent of Asian-American survey respondents said they had faced verbal harassment and just over one in 10 said they had experienced physical assault.
The state of Georgia, which has Atlanta as its capital, is home to nearly 500,000 people of Asian origin, or just over four per cent of its population, according to the Asian American Advocacy Fund.
Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock condemned the violence in a tweet late Tuesday. ""My heart is broken tonight after the tragic violence in Atlanta that took eight lives,"" he said. ""Praying for the families of the victims and for peace for the community."" The Democratic party in the state called Tuesday's shooting spree ""horrifying."" ""As details continue to emerge, this attack sadly follows the unacceptable pattern of violence against Asian Americans that has skyrocketed throughout this pandemic,"" said Congresswoman Nikema Williams, who is also the state party's chairwoman.
In an address to the nation last Thursday, President Joe Biden forcefully condemned what he called ""vicious hate crimes against Asian- Americans who have been attacked, harassed, blamed and scapegoated.""

Asian Americans urged to be cautious: Kulkarni to lead vigil Sunday in Louisville,"Kenning, Chris",Others,2021-03-20,"With violence increasing against Asian Americans nationwide in the wake of ""China Virus"" rhetoric, a Kentucky Chinese-American group is urging members to be cautious while calling on political leaders to step up denunciations of anti-Asian harassment and hate speech.
Changzheng Wang, a leader of the Kentucky Chinese American Association, said while he wasn't aware of violent attacks in the state, the recent Atlanta mass shooting that left six Asian women dead had further ramped-up fears.
""We are very concerned and worried,"" Wang said. ""We've had conversations about the safety of our people. It should never be the case in this county that you should walk out and worry about doing something to you just because of who you are. That's terrible.""
On Sunday, Kentucky's only Asian-American legislator, Rep. Nima Kulkarni, will lead a 6 p.m. vigil in Louisville with interfaith and Asian groups in Louisville's Waterfront Park, joining vigils in Georgia, Illinois and New York.
While police are still investigating the motive for the shooting at several Georgia spas, and whether racism was involved, it has nonetheless put a national spotlight on the toxic stew of racism, xenophobia, and misogyny faced by many Asian-American women.
""We need to encourage as much solidarity as possible,"" Kulkarni said, while also finding ways to better identify and halt anti-Asian incidents.
The rise of such incidents has come amid the coronavirus pandemic, which former President Donald Trump blamed on China. He has referred to COVID-19 as the ""China Virus"" and the ""kung flu.""
From March 2020 to February 2021, Stop AAPI Hate, a group that tracks discrimination and xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, received 3,800 reports of anti-Asian hate, with women reporting hate incidents 2.3 times more than men.
The report only ranked the top 18 states for such incidents, which did not include Kentucky or Indiana.
Neither the Louisville Metro Police nor the Lexington Police responded when The Courier Journal asked whether they had seen any reports or upticks in harassment or assaults against Asian Americans.
Catholic Charities migration and refugee officials, who serve residents from Asian countries around the world living in Louisville, said they haven't heard of any instances of violence.
Some incidents that don't rise to the level of assault, such as verbal or online harassment or vandalism, and are likely not being reported, Kulkarni said.
""We'd like to see politicians and police to take steps to prevent this from happening,"" said Wang, who said his group has urged members to be cautious as they go about their day, including simply going shopping.
""It's just crazy we have to be doing that,"" he said.
He blamed political ""scapegoating"" for fueling anti-Asian sentiment but said it only tapped into an ""age-old problem"" of discrimination toward Asians in the United States.
The Pew Research Center reported last year that 31% of Asian adults surveyed said they were the target of racial slurs or jokes since the pandemic began. On Twitter, the hashtag #StopAsianHate has led many to share experiences of discrimination.
Dan Wu, the Asian-American owner of Atomic Ramen in Lexington, recently wrote in the Lexington Herald-Leader of the daily ""small acts of casual racism encountered by folks like me.""

World: Atlanta Shootings Strike Fear into Asian American Community,None,Others,2021-03-22,"One year after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of new Covid-19 infections is falling, but violent attacks and discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and people of Asian descent continue to rise. Since March 2020, advocacy groups have recorded nearly 3,800 anti-Asian hate incidents, disproportionately targeting women.
On March 16, a mass shooter in an Atlanta suburb targeted three Asian-owned business, killing eight people, including six Asian women. Police later arrested Robert Aaron Long, a 21-year-old white man, for the shooting. Long reportedly denied the killings were racially motivated, although Korean-language media are reporting a witness heard him say, I will kill all Asians.
The attacks come as statistics show a 150 percent surge in anti-Asian hate crimes since the start of the pandemic. People of Asian descent are at greater risk of violence and racism than they were a year ago and many live in fear. Women and older people are especially at risk. Asian women experience 2.5 times more anti-Asian violence than their male counterparts while older people of Asian descent reported being physically assaulted 1.5 times more than the overall Asian American and Pacific Islander population.
Hours before the Atlanta shootings, a 77-year-old man was violently attacked in Oakland, California, and in San Francisco a 64-year-old man was stabbed in the face and a 60-year-old man was pushed over and left partially blind. A week prior, a 75-year-old Asian man died after being robbed and assaulted in Oakland while an 83-year-old Asian woman was knocked unconscious while collecting cans in New York.
On March 1, an 18-year-old Asian woman was violently struck and choked in New York City. On March 12, a 26-year-old Asian woman was called racial slurs and sexually assaulted while waiting for a commuter train in San Jose. In September 2020, a mentally ill Asian woman was attacked and raped by a group of boys and men in Milwaukee.
Whether or not the killings in Atlanta are shown to be racially motivated, they reveal the gravity of the risk and fear people of Asian descent are facing. In addition to ensuring full and fair investigations and accountability for these crimes, local and national leaders should clearly and forcefully denounce anti-Asian racism, misogyny, and white supremacy; develop plans with Asian American and Pacific Islander and immigrant communities to confront violence; and ensure appropriate resources are available for crisis intervention, long-term safety, and healing.

United States: Hate Crimes Targeting Asian Americans Spiked by 150% in Major US Cities,None,Others,2021-03-04,"Hate-fueled attacks on Asian Americans spiked across major U.S. cities last year - in some cases by triple-digit
percentages - even as overall hate crimes declined, newly analyzed police department statistics show.
Moreover, the alarming trend has continued into this year, experts say.
There were 122 incidents of anti-Asian American hate crimes in 16 of the country's most populous cities in 2020,
an increase of almost 150% over the previous year, according to data compiled by California State University's
Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism and exclusively shared with VOA. VOA independently collected data
for two of the cities.
Asian American rights advocates attribute the unprecedented string of attacks to former U.S. President Donald
Trump's rhetoric blaming China for the deadly coronavirus and, more broadly, the scapegoating of Asian
Americans by ordinary people frustrated or angered by the economic and social impact of the pandemic.
I think the political leadership under Trump really put a target on the backs of people perceived to be Chinese.
It's Sinophobia, said Chris Kwok, a board member for the Asian American Bar Association of New York.
Four other American cities also reported triple-digit percentage increases in anti-Asian hate crimes: Philadelphia
and Cleveland each reported six incidents, up from two in 2019; San Jose had 10, up from 4, while Los Angeles reported 15, up from seven.
While most cities experienced overall hate crime declines, including attacks against groups that had recently
spiked like Jews, attacks against Asians rose materially in most cities, and only declined in one - Washington,
D.C., said Brian Levin, executive director of the hate and extremism research center.
The FBI defines a hate crime as a criminal offense motivated by race, religion, sexual orientation and other
factors. Examples include assault and vandalism. Each November, the FBI publishes its annual hate crime data for
the previous year. That means the data released by a handful of police agencies provides the only early window
into the number of hate crimes last year.
Though based on a relatively small sampling of data, the figures strongly suggest that 2020 will be the worst
year this century for anti-Asian hate crime, Levin said.
The reported spike in anti-Asian hate crimes is in line with data tracked by Asian American advocacy
organizations.
Stop AAPI Hate, a hate tracker created last year by several Asian American groups, has recorded more than
2,800 incidents of racism and discrimination targeting Asian Americans between March and December 2020.
While verbal harassment and shunning made up more than 90% of the incidents, physical assaults accounted for
nearly 9%.
Many of the victims are non-Chinese Asians who apparently were mistaken for having hailed from China.
East Asians who look Chinese are now experiencing this, and this goes back to a long history of anti-Asian
discrimination in this country, Kwok said of the United States.
In a troubling report released last month, Stop AAPI Hate said 126 of the incidents involved Asian Americans over
the age of 60. A number of incidents took place in the San Francisco Bay area last month, including one involving
a 91-year-old Asian man violently pushed to the ground by a stranger.These violent assaults have a devastating impact on our community as they are part of an alarming rise in anti-
Asian American hate during the COVID-19 pandemic, co-founders of STOP AAPI Hate said in a February 9statement.
In the latest incident, Salman Muflihi, 23, was arrested last week for allegedly stabbing a 36-year-old Asian man
on a street in New York City's Chinatown. Muflihi was charged over the weekend with one count of attempted
murder in addition to other charges, but not a hate crime. If authorities were to file a hate crime, it could result
in a longer prison sentence.
Kwok said there is a level of frustration in the Asian American community over prosecutors' refusals to file hate
crime charges.
I think they need to really reassess how they approach it, particularly in this era that we're in, which I think of it
as an emergency area, particularly for Asian Americans as they experience discrimination, he said.
In a statement, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said additional charges may be forthcoming.
Meanwhile, overall hate crimes last year declined by an average of 7% in the 15 cities tracked by the center for
the study of hate and extremism. In New York City, for example, police investigated 265 hate crimes, down from
428 the previous year.
Of the five cities that reported increases, two are in California, including San Jose, which saw an increase of
162%. - VOA

"Elderly Asian Man Dies After Injuries From Robbery, Suspect Charged with Murder","Tamanaha, Akemi",Others,2021-03-12,"A 75-year-old Asian man has died after succumbing to injuries sustained from a robbery. The suspect is now
facing special circumstance murder charges.
On Thursday, Alameda County DA Nancy O’Malley filed special circumstances murder and multiple serious felony
charges against Teaunte Bailey, 26, in connection with crimes committed on two different dates in Oakland, CA,
according to a press release.
Bailey allegedly pushed 75-year-old Pak Ho to the ground and robbed him on the morning of March 9 in the
Adams Point neighborhood of Oakland. He fled in his car and was eventually apprehended.
Ho’s head hit the pavement after Bailey shoved him, causing him to sustain a traumatic head injury and brain
damage. He died of his injuries on Thursday.
Bailey is also being charged in connection with a similar crime that occurred February 19 2021. That day he
allegedly broke into a senior living apartment and shoved the 72-year-old victim inside. Police say he stole the
victim’s phone and several other items.
Bailey is being held at Santa Rita jail without bail, according to ABC 7. He is set to be arraigned on Friday, March 12.

"Anti-Asian violence is a public safety crisis for all: Asian elders are perceived as vulnerable. Volunteer escorts, private guards and air horns aren't enough. We need government support and commitment.","Torres, Stacy",Others,2021-03-21,"On my walks through pre-pandemic Shanghai in late September 2019, around every corner I stumbled upon everyday scenes of older people's integration into the fabric of the city and community life.
People with full heads of gray hair rode bikes and sat in front of storefronts, chatting with neighbors and eating meals from large metal bowls. An old woman whizzed by in a motorized wheelchair alongside scooters in the street. At Fuxing Park, grandpas tended to grandchildren and older men bounced spinning disks in a game of diabolo.
After three days of walking around Shanghai's teeming streets, I rested my weary feet at Jing'an Sculpture Park. An old man glanced at me writing in my notebook and struck up a conversation in English. He'd studied English in the United States and wanted to know how old I thought he was. 70, I guessed. He threw his head back and smiled. 85. He lived nearby and came to the park every day.
Asian elders in America are vulnerable
Such postcards echo similar scenes in Asian neighborhoods across the United States. They remind me of older men smoking, chatting and sipping warm beverages in a plaza near San Francisco's Japantown and a trio of elders gathered for morning calisthenics in North Beach's Washington Square. They spark sweet memories of the elders I saw before the pandemic who danced at Portsmouth Square in Chinatown, reminding me that I've not danced with my hula class in a year. Many Asian American and Pacific Islander elders in my halau modeled aging with joy, smiling as they danced through aches and pains and weathered the loss of relatives and friends.
Public outings carry extra danger for Asian people, with a spate of recent attacks targeted against Asian elders that have resulted in racial trauma, injury, and death. In the Bay Area, viral videos showed the senseless killing of an 84-year-old Thai man named Vicha Ratanapakdee, thrown violently to the ground in San Francisco. Days later, another video surfaced of a 91-year-old man also shoved in Oakland's Chinatown. Other violence against Asian elders has involved robbery, such as the ambush of a 67-year-old man in San Francisco laundromat and 75-year-old Pak Ho robbed and killed in Oakland during his morning walk last week.
Volunteer escorts have sprung up to assist Asian elders, along with other DIY community safety efforts such as hiring private armed security guards and providing shopkeepers with air horns. But they aren't a cure-all, and public safety depends on sustained government support and commitment.
These attacks haven't occurred in a vacuum but have intersected with rising violence and economic insecurity. Desolate cities and empty retail spaces from businesses that haven't survived the COVID pandemic mean fewer ""eyes on the street,"" increasing danger for everyone, but especially Asian elders who may be perceived as vulnerable. Decades of structural racism and community disinvestment have exacerbated the pandemic's acute economic devastation and increasing gun violence across the country.
Russell Jeung, San Francisco State University professor and co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, has pointed to community disinvestment in areas with Asian residents, ""We live in multiracial neighborhoods with high crime rates and in these neighborhoods everybody is attacked, everybody is vulnerable...on a day to day basis in these high crime neighborhoods, pretty much every racial group is a target. We need more opportunities and more resources in these under-resourced communities like mine.""
'Bullets flying by your house'
Reimagining community safety doesn't mean flooding streets with police officers. It does mean investing in jobs, educational opportunities, health care and affordable housing that make healthy communities, and programs to promote public safety such as non-police community ambassador programs and violence reduction efforts targeted towards young people.
In Oakland, pandemic closures of schools and community spaces have hampered community violence prevention programs. Recently, for the first time in a year I saw teenagers doing football drills on a gleaming new field at Fremont High School, benefiting the school's mostly Black and brown student body. I felt safer witnessing this small but important step forward.
""Even if you're not directly impacted, having bullets flying by your house is traumatic,"" says Loren Taylor, a city council member representing East Oakland. Last month I experienced this trauma during a quiet Sunday afternoon interrupted by the firecracker sound of spraying bullets across the street from my Oakland home. No one was harmed, but as I watched police officers place at least 10 yellow evidence markers near bullet casings, I worried about the Chinese grandmother who often sits with her grandson on the porch of their intergenerational home two doors down. Fortunately, she was safe.
Racism and violence are twin public health crises that require a response as urgent as our investment in COVID vaccine development. Living in a fortress is not a solution, nor should we expect anyone to restrict their activities and movement due to fear and racism. In this tense time we mustn't lose sight of public acts of interracial solidarity, such as rallies against anti-Asian violence. We have a collective interest in safe public spaces and communities free from racial harm.
When vandals destroyed treasured cherry blossom trees outside San Francisco's Japanese Cultural Center in January, I reflected on how much we have already lost to hate. The community raised funds for replacements, but unless we root out the seeds of hate, we will be replanting trees and mourning lives needlessly lost for generations to come.

Volunteers taking action after attacks against Asian Americans,"Aspegren, Elinor",Others,2021-03-12,"SAN FRANCISCO – A recent surge in assaults and harassment of Asian Americans in Northern California has
mobilized activists, organizers, and those that live there to keep their communities safe.
In one week in February, a 91-year-old man in Oakland Chinatown was brutally assaulted, a Thai man was
attacked and killed in San Francisco and a Vietnamese woman was assaulted and robbed of $1,000 in San Jose.
The attacks pushed Jacob Azevedo to reach out on social media, offering to walk with anyone in the Oakland
community who was feeling unsafe, especially older Asian Americans.
His Instagram post gained widespread attention, prompting four community members to reach out to him with
organizing help.
And now, a month later, 700 people have signed up with Compassion in Oakland to escort older Asian Americans
in the Bay Area community.
But that's only a part of what Compassion in Oakland does, Jess Owyoung, one of the four people to reach out
and help form the group, told USA TODAY.
""What we've been doing is going out into Oakland Chinatown and just talking to business owners, talking to
community members, talking to elderly, looking for places where we could be of help,"" she said, detailing that the group has also helped seniors translate police report forms and pick up groceries.
Violence against Asian Americans sharply increased beginning in March 2020 as COVID-19 spread across the
country and some politicians blamed China for the pandemic, Russell Jeung, who created Stop AAPI Hate, told
USA TODAY last month.
At least 2,808 incidents of anti-Asian American discrimination were recorded by the website from March19 to
Dec.31, 2020. Another organization, Asian Americans Advancing Justice – Asian American Justice Center,
recorded more than 3,000 hate incidents in its self-reporting system since late April 2020 – by far the highest
number in the tool's four-year history.
""It's unfortunate that this is happening, but it's not something that is new,"" Owyoung said, speaking of her own
experience with racism. ""I think it's something that has exacerbated and it's been brought further into the light.""
Activists and volunteer groups, like Compassion in Oakland, are raising awareness about these violent incidents
to rally help – and in the case of this group, seek unity.
""It's only natural to have feelings of anger and hate, and to want to take action in maybe a negative way,""
Owyoung said. ""But we know that that's not the solution and to fight hate with hate is not going to bring us
closer to becoming a better country, or just a better community.""
Next, Compassion in Oakland plans to secure nonprofit status and expand its mission of safety and community
around the nation. First, they plan to advise the Greater Los Angeles Area on how to create its own community
organization.
They've also set up a donation page to help bring their efforts to older Asian Americans.
""A lot of the elderly that we see were stuck in their homes for a year. And some of these people have just been
getting out there just for the first time,"" Owyoung said.
But ""there's people that see that (older people) might be afraid or scared,"" she said. ""And we recognize that's a
fear that they might have and that we want to be there for them as a community.""

A new study has linked the rise in anti-Asian online hate speech with President Donald Trump's COVID-19 rhetoric,"Shalvey, Kevin",Others,2021-03-27,"The Anti-Defamation League said online hate speech aimed at Asian Americans rose last year. 
Rhetoric from President Donald Trump and other leaders fueled the rise, a study said. 
ADL saw an ""85% increase in anti-Asian sentiment on Twitter"" after Trump got COVID-19.* See more stories on Insider's business page.
As President Donald Trump and other US officials last year referred to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus,"" the ""Kung Flu,"" and other incendiary nicknames, a chorus of commentators warned that their rhetoric would lead to an increase in harassment and hateful speech.
""There is no blame in this,"" said Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director at the World Health Organization, when asked about Trump's language in March 2020.
Now, a newly published study by the Anti-Defamation League has shown that the pandemic corresponded with a rise in hate speech and harassment on social networks aimed at Asian Americans. While it's difficult to quantify the effects of the president's comments, the study said some of that rise could be attributed to Trump's statements.
Online harassment aimed at Asian Americans jumped about six percentage points in 2020 and early 2021, the largest rise for any group of people during the same period, according to a study published this week by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL.)
About 17% of Asian Americans reported ""severe"" online harassment, up from 11% in the same earlier period, according to the study. In the same time period, online harassment reported by all Americans on social networks dipped about three points.
The survey added to previously published data about the rise of anti-Asian American speech since the start of the pandemic. Researchers at the University of California at San Francisco said this month that Trump's first tweet with the term ""China virus"" triggered a rise in anti-Asian hashtags on Twitter.
The ADL study also linked the rise in anti-Asian American sentiment on social networks and in the real world directly to Trump's ""incendiary rhetoric"" about the coronavirus.
""The spike in physical violence against Asian-Americans across the nation was whipped up in large part by bigotry and conspiracy theories that grew online, fanned by national leaders,"" including Trump, the study said.
ADL said its researchers saw an ""85 percent increase in anti-Asian sentiment on Twitter"" after news broke that Trump had COVID-19.
Late last year, Twitter updated its policies around hate speech, saying in part it had developed ""longer, more in-depth"" training for its internal teams.
ADL said such efforts by tech companies haven't yet made a difference.
""Although technology companies insist they have taken robust action to address users' safety and remove harmful content throughout the past year, this report finds scant difference in the number of Americans who experienced online hate and harassment,"" said the study released this week.
Since Trump departed office, there's been an uptick in leaders voicing concern about hate speech and violence toward Asian Americans.
On January 26, a few days after Biden took office, he issued a memo condemning hate speech against Asian Americans. Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said he commended President Joe Biden for taking a stance against xenophobia toward Asian Americans.
""President Trump weaponized racism and xenophobia in 2020 by calling COVID-19 the 'Kung Flu Virus' and we are still witnessing increased hate speech and violence as a result,"" Krishnamoorthi said.

Anti-Asian violence shows folly of defunding,None,Others,2021-03-23,"There's an old saying about traditions: Abandon a tradition, it tells us, and you will soon learn why it became one.
That's what California cities are learning today, as city councils around the state have acted on the urging of Black Lives Matter protesters and diverted portions of their former police budgets to social action causes in previously underserved neighborhoods.
But the spate of anti-Asian violence now playing out in California communities as disparate as Sacramento, San Jose, Los Angeles, San Leandro and Orange County dramatically shows this was folly.
The logical police response to on-street attacks ought to be more foot and squad car patrols, but that's not happening in most places despite the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes. So they continue, showing no signs of abating.
Before the coronavirus pandemic, this was not a big problem. Hate crimes against Asians were relatively few and far between. But a huge upswing began just about the time ex-President Donald Trump dubbed the coronavirus plague the ""Chinese virus,"".
Around California, these crimes have far more than doubled over the last year, but no one can put a precise number on them. In San Francisco, they have at least tripled. In Los Angeles, there have been more than twice as many this year as a year ago. But official numbers are likely far lower than in real life, partly because police don't do much about the attacks.
Not even 700-person rallies decrying the attacks, like one the other day in San Jose, can stop them.
The head of a Southern California group called Asian-Americans Advancing Justice told one reporter many such crimes go unreported because of language problems, immigrants unable to communicate with police. Plus, she said, ""When victims...come forward, having the police say nothing can be done discourages other victims from relying on police.""
Some immigrant advocates also say Korean-Americans and other Asian groups are perceiving new bias among police officers, perhaps caused by the Trump rhetoric.
But the mere presence of cops on street patrol could have stopped one early March assault on an elderly Asian man who was seated in a Nob Hill laundromat in San Francisco when at attacker ambushed him. Police presence probably would have spared the death of Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thai-American beaten to death in broad daylight, also in San Francisco.
Neither of their assailants has been identified, like most others conducting the current spate of attacks.
There are also less violent, but still threatening incidents. One Asian-American woman stopped at a red light the other day in Fresno and a man in the next car signaled she should roll down her window. When she did, he shouted, ""Get out of my country — that's an order."" After pausing, he reportedly added, ""I'll kill you.""
All this is a demonstration that even a ""model minority"" noted for high achievement and founding large and successful businesses of many types can suddenly be targeted, especially when national leaders become loose-lipped about their own prejudices.
It also shows that not only California, but the entire nation needs effective policing to protect minorities who have no way to know when they might be victimized, even if their particular ethnic group enjoys generally high public esteem.
Because bigots have always picked on those they see as weak, this is especially important for elderly and frail individuals.
Yes, the pandemic appears to have originated in or near the Chinese city of Wuhan. But there is no evidence it was deliberately perpetrated on the world. The claim that it was amounts to a blood libel against Chinese individuals who would have been thousands of miles away even if deeds like this had been done.
Because most others have difficulty discerning Asians' native nationalities simply from their appearance, all Asian-Americans are now at serious risk, especially if they don't look strong, a la the Los Angeles Angels' 6-foot, 4-inch, 210 pound Shohei Otani.
Police are their only assured protection from random violence and bigotry when they leave their homes. And the fewer cops on the street, the more danger for them. Which is just one reason it makes little sense to defund police, as Americans are now discovering.

"Cincinnati's Asian Americans face harsh reality of hate: 'We don't exist,' even as violent incidents increase","BieryGolick, Keith",Others,2021-03-21,"Felicity Tao received more media requests in the last few days than she has in the last year. The requests all looked the same, and they would be familiar to any minority community dealing with tragedy.
The reporters she talked to almost seemed to follow a script – a script in search of pain. And when they couldn't find that, or her pain wasn't painful enough, they moved on.
Tao was being asked these questions because eight people had been killed in a series of shootings in and around Atlanta on Tuesday night. Six of the victims were women of Asian descent.
It was the kind of shocking violence that grabbed the nation's attention. Finally, America could see the kind of Asian racism that is often hidden away or underreported, even as former President Donald Trump seemed to revel in calling COVID-19 the ""Chinese virus.""
But even with eight people dead, there was debate about whether the attack was a hate crime. About whether racism was the primary motive. About whether America was finally ready to stop Asian hate.
Tao was a journalist before immigrating to America, and she knows the truth is more complex than that. The truth is Tao was in San Francisco for her 20th wedding anniversary a few years ago when a woman kicked her luggage and told her to go back to her country.
She hasn't experienced overt racism like that in Cincinnati. But the truth is she often feels invisible here, which takes its own heavy toll. Because there is no Chinatown here, and stories of prejudice against Asian people often go untold.
Tao is a communications director for the Greater Cincinnati Chinese School in Butler County, and she founded the Greater Cincinnati Chinese Cultural Exchange Association. She is an advocate who knows Asian people are underrepresented in Cincinnati media, including The Enquirer.
She knows this because she is the one sending press releases that often go unanswered. And after the devastating attacks in Atlanta, the intense spotlight on Asian Americans only reinforces the lack of attention they are normally paid.
""We don't exist,"" Tao said.
'People are scared'
Across the street from a sports bar in Silverton, the sign hangs in all capital letters: WANGLAW. In the window below, there is a poster: ""English is spoken here.""
Standing in the lobby looking out at the window, Charleston Wang says the poster helps keep white nationalists away. He laughs, but it's hard to tell if he's joking.
After watching the news conferences about what happened on Tuesday, Wang looked up the definition of sex addiction. He did this because he felt confused and offended and sad as he watched a sheriff's spokesperson in Georgia answer questions about a possible motive for the attacks.
The suspect had denied any racial motivation, police said, and blamed the violence on his sexual addiction.
""Yesterday was a really bad day for him,"" the white police official said about the white suspect. ""And this is what he did.""
Wang recites the deputy's name, Capt. Jay Baker, along with other details of the shootings almost 500 miles away. He slaps his hands on the maroon leather couch in his office.
""People are scared,"" he said.
Wang didn't know these women, but he has clients like them. Wang is an immigration lawyer who has represented dozens of spa workers. He's represented them after they've been sued for allegedly causing injury. He's represented them after they've fled their country. He's represented them trying to get married. And he's represented them after police stings.
In most cases, Wang said, they're vulnerable targets.
He throws his hands around, hitting the couch again. He's stressed. He's mad. He's a lot of things.
He is 65, and his hair is colored orange. On one side of the couch is a bowl of fake fruit, grapes and strawberries. On the other side is a large American flag.
Wang was born in Taiwan and lived in Malaysia before he came to America when he was 16. When he graduated from college, and his hair reached beyond his shoulders, his diploma credited Cheng-Kung Wang. When he passed the bar exam a few years later, he added another name to the certificate, which is framed in his office.
Charleston.
He picked the name out of a hat.
This week, when Wang looked up the definition of sex addiction, he found research saying it is not an established psychiatric diagnosis. He found the American Psychiatric Association removed sex addiction from its guidebook of mental disorders in 2012.
And as he watched the discussion surrounding the Atlanta killings, he couldn't help but think the deaths were being minimized. He couldn't help but feel like the victims were being blamed.
It hurt him, even though Wang doesn't feel persecuted in Cincinnati. Because the man with orange hair says he often feels invisible too.
'Where are you really from?'
Felicity Tao came to America when she was 25.
She left China with her husband, Mingyi Weng, to attend grad school. Her university was in a cornfield somewhere in Illinois. He was in Cincinnati. She always planned to return to China, and she did. She thought her husband would join her a few years later.
But he didn't want to leave. He loved Cincinnati. Compared to where they lived, Cincinnati was quiet.
He convinced her to come back. To leave their parents behind and start over. Because he felt this was the best place to raise their children.
There are times now, especially last year, when her husband felt like they made the wrong decision. Today, they both realize the American ideals they once believed in are more dreams than realities. The America they fantasized about, the one they saw in Hollywood movies, doesn't exist.
This is an America where, in Cincinnati, owners of a Chinese restaurant say their homes and cars have been egged. Where the restaurant receives calls daily telling them to ""go back to China."" Where staff must be walked to their cars at night.
Because the coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, China, more than a third of Americans said they witnessed someone blame Asian people for the pandemic last year.
Tao hasn't been directly confronted with a racist phrase describing the virus, but she's heard of others who have – including kids at school. She does fear one question, though: Where are you from? Because when the answer is Cincinnati, it's usually followed by another question:
Where are you really from?
To her kids, who are 19 and 14, Cincinnati is the only home they've ever known. Tao doesn't talk to them about the violent attacks against Asian Americans that seem to be happening more frequently across the country than ever before. Stories about a 64-year-old grandmother robbed of cash she withdrew from an ATM to buy Lunar New Year gifts. Stories about a 52-year-old woman being shot in the head with a flare gun. Stories about an 84-year-old man smashed against the pavement during his morning walk.
Tao doesn't talk about how the number of hate crimes reported in America's biggest cities went down last year, according to a study at California State University, but the number of hate crimes reported against Asians rose 149%.
She doesn't talk about a national intelligence report that concludes there will be a heightened threat of ""domestic violent extremism"" this year.
She doesn't talk about how a group tracking discrimination said it received more than 3,000 firsthand accounts of anti-Asian harassment since the pandemic began – compared to roughly 100 incidents in each previous year.
Tao knows this comes from her own insecurity, because she wants her children to believe they can do anything. Because that's how she was raised. She doesn't want them to feel like victims.
Even if, sometimes, they are.
In Cincinnati, data collected by the police department shows there were fewer crimes against Asian people last year than in at least a decade. But the truth is more complicated than that. And experts say those numbers can be wildly underreported.
These days, Tao's own parents worry about her safety. And friends across the world ask why her family moved to America. Tao tries to brush off those fears, especially to her parents. She doesn't want to scare them. But the fear is there, inside her head.
And it comes out in tears when she talks about her sons. Because she worries about their safety, too.
When Tao thinks about the future of our country, this can-do person who prides herself on positivity finds herself wondering something she has never wondered before. Is America really a place of liberty and justice for all?
""I have doubt,"" she said.

5 key moments from Congress' hearing about anti-Asian violence in the wake of the Atlanta shootings,"Sheth, Sonam; Seddiq, Oma",Others,2021-03-18,"• Two days after the Atlanta shootings, the House held a hearing to address anti-Asian violence.
• One Republican lawmaker pointed the finger at China and invoked a saying glorifying lynchings.
• Democrats zeroed in on Trump's rhetoric and witnesses described the US's history of scapegoating immigrants.
* See more stories on Insider's business page.
A House judiciary subcommittee held a hearing Thursday to address discrimination and violence against Asian-Americans. The nonprofit organization Stop AAPI Hate
has documented nearly 3,800 incidents of physical assault, shunning, verbal and online harassment, and civil rights violations against the AAPI community in the US
since March 2020, when COVID-19 cases began to surge.In addition to taking place amid a spike in anti-Asian violence across the country, Thursday's hearing came days after a series of deadly shootings at three Atlanta-
area massage parlors that killed eight people, six of whom were Asian women. Robert Aaron Long, a 21-year-old white man, has been arrested and charged withmurder in connection to the shootings.
Here are 5 key moments from Thursday's hearing
• Rep. Chip Roy employed whataboutism to point the finger at China.
* ""I think the Chinese Communist Party running the country of China, I think they are the bad guys,"" the Texas Republican said. ""I think that they are harming people
and I think they are engaging in modern day slavery.""
• What they are doing to Uighurs ... what they are doing targeting our country ... what they are doing to undermine our national security, and what they are doing to
steal our intellectual property, and what they are doing to build up their military and rattle throughout the Pacific, I think it's patently evil and deserving of
condemnation,"" he added. ""And I think that what they did to hide the reality of this virus is equally deserving of condemnation.""
• Roy quoted an old saying glorifying lynchings at a hearing about racist violence.
* All ""victims of race-based violence and their families deserve justice,"" Roy said. He then tacked on: ""There's old sayings in Texas about find all the rope in Texas and
get a tall oak tree. You know, we take justice very seriously, and we ought to do that. Round up the bad guys.""
-Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) March 18, 2021
• Rep. Grace Meng grew emotional while firing back at Roy.
* ""Your president and your party and your colleagues can talk about issues with any other country that you want, but you don't have to do it by putting a bullseye on
the back of Asian-Americans across this country, on our grandparents, on our kids,"" Meng said.
• The New York congresswoman choked up as she continued, ""This hearing was to address the hurt and pain of our community and to find solutions, and we will not let
you take our voice away from us.""
• Democrats accuse Trump and Republicans of fueling anti-Asian hate by using inflammatory rhetoric about COVID-19.
* Several Democratic lawmakers skewered the former president and his allies for using terms like ""Wuhan virus,"" ""China virus,"" and ""Kung flu"" to describe the
coronavirus pandemic.
• ""As we look at the outrage, let me put into the record: the 45th president always referred to coronavirus as the 'China virus' or 'Kung flu,'"" said Rep. Sheila Jackson
Lee of Texas. ""Let me call his name: President Trump.""
• ""The rise of hate crimes against Asian-Americans is inherently tied to anti-Asian American rhetoric, some of which has come out of this very chamber,"" said freshman
congresswoman Cori Bush. She went on to say that when such rhetoric is used by historically privileged groups, they ""have to own that it causes harm to people,
especially people of color"" because there are ""lives at stake.""
• Witnesses highlighted the US's long history of scapegoating immigrants and minorities in times of crisis.
* ""As shocking as these incidents are, it is so vital to understand that they are not random acts perpetrated by deranged individuals,"" said Erika Lee, a professor of
history and Asian-American studies at the University of Minnesota. ""They are an expression of our country's long history of systemic racism targeting Asian-Americans
and Pacific Islanders.""
• ""We have heard in the past 24 hours many describe anti-Asian discrimination and racial violence as un-American,"" she added. ""Unfortunately, it is very American.""

Ohio must strengthen hate crime protections,"Davis, Gabe",Others,2020-04-26,"Don't look now, but Donald Trump is dangerously stoking the fires of bigotry and ethnic intimidation during a crisis, while elected Republicans responsible for upholding our laws and promoting public safety are silent.
For days in March, while COVID-19 raged, Trump eagerly fueled anti-Asian sentiment by calling it ""the Chinese virus,"" even as the FBI warned the country that hate crimes against Asian Americans were likely to ""surge"" because of stereotypes about the virus.
Rather than stop there, Trump took his bigotry to the airwaves in April and ran a sleazy ad against former vice president Joe Biden. The ad tries to attack Biden by splicing clips to falsely suggest that the former governor of Washington, who is Asian American and a colleague of Biden's, was really an official of the Chinese government.
All of this has unfolded against a backdrop of hundreds of reports from around the country of rising harassment and hate crimes: increased attacks against members of the Asian/Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI) community.
Such acts have even included physical assaults in New York and Texas, where an Asian American family, including two young children, were stabbed by a man who said he acted because he thought the family was spreading the coronavirus.
Ohio is not immune. In our state, we are proudly home to 350,000 AAPI residents. According to an open letter condemning coronavirus-fueled racism that was organized by the Ohio Progressive Asian Women's Leadership and signed by over 100 Ohio organizations, children across Ohio have recently experienced increased bullying based on their AAPI heritage.
Tragically, we know from examples like that involving Emilie Olsen – a 13-year-old Chinese American girl from Fairfield who committed suicide in 2014 after being bullied in part based on her heritage – that such harassment can have deadly consequences.
Hamilton County is also not immune. According to the FBI, of all major cities in Ohio, Cincinnati recently had the highest per capita rate of reported hate crimes, with 30 incidents in 2018 alone. Given that hate crimes are notoriously underreported, it is almost certain that more are occurring.
I know from my experience prosecuting hate crimes when I was a federal prosecutor, that Hamilton County has seen its fair share of them. Sadly, we have also looked the other way, such as when a Cincinnati jury acquitted an attacker for the tragic beating and murder of Vincent Chin in an infamous anti-AAPI hate crime from the 1980s.
With the recent rise in hate crimes and harassment, it is painfully clear that we must do more to strengthen our hate crime protections. Specifically:
We must call on Ohio lawmakers to change our ethnic intimidation law, so committing a hate crime is an automatic felony offense.
We should also expand Ohio's hate crime law to cover sexual orientation, gender identity, and those with disabilities.
We should tap special prosecutors trained in hate crimes to handle these cases through a Civil Rights Division at the Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office, which I have previously called for creating.
Finally, we should elect a prosecutor who will not be silent in the face of these kinds of attacks, or Trump's inciteful behavior – not during this crisis, and not ever.
We need a prosecutor who will call out the dangerous rhetoric, because words matter and can lead to violence.
We need a prosecutor who will build bridges with members of our AAPI, African American, and Latinx communities, and all communities that are vulnerable to bias crimes.
We need a prosecutor who will learn from other elected prosecutors and set up innovative mechanisms such as hate crime hotlines.
Finally, we need a prosecutor who will actively encourage victims of potential hate crimes to tell law enforcement, because the law cannot address what it does not know.
We do not currently have such a leader in the prosecutor's office, which is why I'm running, and asking for your support. We must meet hate and fear with action, and we must do it together. In the words of Martin Luther King Jr., ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.""
We are all in this together.

COVID plays host to another contagion: racism,"SOUTPHOMMASANE, TIM",Others,2020-04-11,"Living amid a pandemic is enough to make all of us afraid. No one today, at least no one with any sense, can enjoy freedom from fear. Some of us have more reason to fear than others. Think of our doctors and nurses, our sick and elderly. Think of our fellow citizens who have lost their livelihoods. Then think about those who have become visible scapegoats for our predicament.
On Wednesday, a group of prominent Chinese Australians issued an open letter warning that national unity was at risk. According to the group, which includes former Australian of the Year John Yu, writer Benjamin Law and chef Adam Liaw, ""the recent rise in anti-Chinese sentiment is driving a marked escalation in racial abuse against Asian Australians"".
There is growing evidence of a deterioration. The Australian Human Rights Commission has recorded a spike in racial discrimination complaints. There are reports across the country of Asian Australians experiencing verbal abuse, evictions, even physical attacks. In Sydney this week, a man was charged with intimidation after cracking a whip and threatening people outside the Chinese consulate.
Minorities rarely fare well during pandemics. In the current case, Chinese and Asian Australians were almost certain to be targeted for backlash. For the virus did originate in Wuhan, China. The Chinese government did fail to respond quickly enough to the outbreak.
But these aren't reasons to be vilifying or targeting anyone who looks Chinese. And they're far from good reasons to be calling COVID-19 ""the Chinese virus"", as Donald Trump and others have christened it. Viruses don't have ethnic or racial characteristics. So far, mainstream Australian political leaders have avoided Trumpian excess. But why, then, has anti-Chinese sentiment appeared nonetheless to grow?
Discrimination always arises from existing anxieties and prejudices. And for some time now, anti-Chinese sentiment has been brewing. Often running alongside concerns about Chinese Communist Party ""fifth columnists"", there is unease about Chinese buyers outbidding locals at home auctions, or acquiring agricultural land.
It's fertile ground for anger to sprout. Consider the outrage over the panic hoarding of goods, including by supposed busloads of shopping ""tourists"" encroaching on supermarkets in regional towns. The absence of evidence hasn't prevented the wide circulation of stories about Asian tourist buses launching sinister raids. Perhaps it's because they fit neatly into existing narratives, built on suspicion.
Things could get worse. The likelihood of further economic pain and prolonged physical isolation may see prejudice and anger fester.
Yet racism poses a threat to the solidarity needed right now. As the American political scientist Francis Fukuyama has highlighted, the countries faring best in dealing with the coronavirus are characterised by trust. What matters is ""whether citizens trust their leaders, and whether those leaders preside over a competent and effective state"".
Case in point: the US, where the human disaster is measured in deaths rapidly mounting by the thousands. The Trump administration has succeeded only in sowing a distrust of government usually found in failed states.
The task at hand isn't just about meeting the immediate health and economic threat of the pandemic. It's also about ensuring we come out of the crisis the right way.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has to date spoken about our society and economy going into a period of hibernation. And in his speech to Parliament on Wednesday, he spoke about ""defending and protecting Australia's national sovereignty"".
However, will we ever return to what we knew as normal? In politics, a Coalition government is acting (at least temporarily) like a social democratic one, having introduced a massive stimulus package. Beyond politics, in work and in society, many of the old rules may no longer exist.
It's still too soon to know, but our pandemic response may end up less of a hibernation, and more of a transition. History shows that crises are often moments for transforming society. Rather than merely a challenge of national defence, as the PM suggests, this pandemic also presents one of reconstruction.
Having pulled up the drawbridge for now, there's a risk of our national sentiment becoming too insular, too defensive. What's needed isn't so much a rallying cry of sovereignty, but of nation-building. If we need trust, it's not only trust in government, it's trust among citizens.
The kind of nation we rebuild - the kind of social contract we re-enact - will be determined not just by government, but by us as citizens. In these extraordinary times, almost all our lives have grown more ordinary. The little things, the gestures and exchanges between us, have taken on new meaning. All the more reason to stamp out the racism, often
insidious, creeping into the lives of many Australians.

"Activists fighting coronavirus-driven hate crimes are rallying on social media to turn masks into a symbol, rather than a target in racist attacks","Elder, Jeff",Others,2020-04-06,"Activists are encouraging people to post photos of themselves wearing masks on social media to show solidarity with victims who have been attacked in hate crimes. Congress and activists have cited racist hate crimes against Asian-Americans who were wearing masks to protect them from COVID-19.
The CDC last week reversed course on government guidance about wearing masks during the pandemic by urging Americans to wear them.
""I used to refuse wearing masks when I was younger to avoid being made fun of,"" says Michelle Hanabusa, founder of UPRISERS, a Los Angeles-based clothing brand, which
sells masks emblazoned with the hashtag on her website. The hashtag ""is meant to combat any of these stigmas.""
Activists against COVID-19-related hate crimes are leading a social media campaign using images of people in masks to fight back against attacks on Asian-Americans, which Congress and the FBI say are increasing.
Last week the Centers for Disease Control asked Americans to wear non-medical masks in public, which the activists see as an opportunity to spread their message that racist attacks related to the virus must stop. The US surgeon general previously urged Americans not to buy or wear masks. Activists say masks have become a powerful symbol of the controversy and conflicts involving the virus.
The activists are encouraging people to post photos of themselves in masks with the hashtag #HateIsAVirus to illustrate that wearing masks – and the virus itself – are in no way specific to any race, region, or nation.
—HATEISAVIRUS (@hateisavirus_) March 29, 2020
Other hashtags, including #WashTheHate, #RacismIsAVirus, #IAmNotCOVID19, have protested hate crimes and hate speech, and condemned President Donald Trump's use of the phrase ""Chinese virus."" The president said last week that while the CDC is urging people to wear masks, he chooses not to.
Michelle Hanabusa, founder of UPRISERS, a Los Angeles-based clothing brand, sells masks emblazoned with the hashtag on her website. ""I used to refuse wearing masks when I was younger to avoid being made fun of,"" she says. The hashtag ""is meant to combat any of these stigmas.""
Indeed, it appears that the mask has become something of a symbol.
""From the data available in public reporting, as well as ongoing studies and online conversation that we've been aggregating on racismiscontagious.com, it is clear that the mask has been a polarizing object,"" says Selina Guo, a New York advertising director at the firm ADMERASIA, which runs the website in collaboration with several non-profits. Masks were the top target sparking attacks after race and ethnicity, according to data on the site. ""We are anxious to see if this announcement ultimately flattens or exacerbates these instances.""
Racist attacks on the rise
Last week the FBI warned law enforcement across the country that hate crimes against Asians may increase due to the virus, according to a bureau report obtained by ABC News, ""The FBI makes this assessment based on the assumption that a portion of the US public will associate COVID-19 with China and Asian American populations,"" ABC quoted the report as saying.
Two-dozen federal lawmakers from the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC), wrote a letter urging Congress ""to help us prevent hysteria, ignorant attacks, and racist assaults that have been fueled by misinformation pertaining to the 2019 novel coronavirus."" The letter cited an attack in February, on an Asian woman wearing a protective mask who was kicked and punched in a New York subway station.
Racist attacks on Asian-Americans have surged to about 100 per day, according to Democratic Rep. Judy Chu of California, leader of the caucus, who said on MSNBC last week that some victims were ""assaulted just for wearing a face mask.""
  Organizers of the social media campaign aimed at stopping the attacks say the recent news events related to masks and attacks are a chance to communicate their cause.
""Masks have been a topic of huge debate. A lot of us have families in Asia, and our parents were worried that we weren't wearing masks. But then on the other hand they saw news reports about racist attacks on people wearing masks. The government urged people not to wear masks, and now it wants people to wear non-medical masks. That controversy shows what a powerful symbol they are,"" says Tammy Cho, cofounder of Executive Alerts, a social media startup acquired by the Meltwater public relations firm in 2015. Cho also cofounded BetterBrave, a nonprofit that gave tools and resources to employees who experience sexual harassment.
Cho and other leaders of the movement encourage people to post the hashtag on Instagram photos of themselves in masks to raise awareness of hate crimes, to discuss their own experiences with COVID-19 and racism, to share resources and links, and to support people who have been targeted in attacks.
Bryan Pham, who leads the 44,000-member Asian Hustle Network private group on Facebook, says the campaign ""aims to increase awareness against racism and xenophobia while normalizing the need for Americans to wear masks to protect themselves from COVID-19.""
Organizers estimate the hashtag has reached more than 4 million, as it has been adopted by influencers including the 1.6 million-follower Instagram account of the magazine Elle Korea.

Eastern Washington University sociology professor Pui-Yan Lam remains hopeful despite what she called ""an alarming"" increase in anti-Asian discrimination and hate crimes across the world as a result of the COVID-19 epidemic.
In a Tuesday interview conducted for The Spokesman-Review's Northwest Passages Book Club, Lam said there have been no recent reports of anti-Asian hate crimes from the Spokane Police Department. But last week a reporting center co-founded by San Francisco State University's Asian American Studies Department said it has received more than 1,100 reports of coronavirus discrimination from Asian Americans across the country.
""What I have heard firsthand is friends of Asian descent telling me they're worried to go out to the grocery store alone - that if they go out wearing a mask, they will attract negative attention,"" Lam said. ""That fear is here in Spokane communities, too.""
Lam emphasized the power of language as a weapon to spread either hate or compassion.
""I think it's easy for well-meaning people to dismiss discrimination as 'just words that will go away,' "" she said. ""I would like people in Spokane to not only denounce hate, but also to choose compassion when we speak.""
Lam said misplaced language creates an ""us vs. them"" dynamic that leads to the dehumanization of other groups - ""especially linking our group to a disease,"" she said, referencing the World Health Organization's May 2015 ""Best Practices for the Naming of New Human Infectious Diseases"" guidelines, which seek to ""avoid causing offense to any cultural, social, national, regional, professional or ethnic groups.""
Spokane is becoming more diverse, Lam said. ""One thing people would say to me when I first got to EWU was 'Spokane never changes' - we will always be very homogenous,"" she said. ""But I'm sure people are noticing the increased diversity, and I know most folks embrace that.""
She is looking forward to seeing Spokane County's 2020 census data, and said the many things that can happen as a result of increased diversity can ""change Spokane for the better.""
And Lam believes the COVID-19 epidemic can be a defining moment for Spokane.
""When I take walks in my neighborhood, and people smile and wave at me - Spokanites do that - I appreciate it. At this moment, those simple gestures mean a whole lot more to me,"" she said.
""With all the anxiety we all have to face right now, just seeing smiling, friendly faces makes me feel like I'm part of the community.""",2877
"New York City Sees Rise in Coronavirus Hate Crimes Against Asians; The NYPD is planning a social media campaign to promote a message of unity, officials said","Chapman, Ben",Others,2020-04-02,"Coronavirus-related hate crimes against Asian-Americans have risen in New York City, according to new New York Police Department data.
Since March 7, the NYPD has received complaints of 11 hate crimes related to the disease, police officials said Wednesday, ranging from harassment to assault—all of them targeting New Yorkers with Asian backgrounds. NYPD officers have made arrests in seven of those cases.
The incidents occurred in neighborhoods in all five boroughs of the city, officials said.
In one incident, police said, a 51-year-old woman riding a bus in the Bronx was attacked by three 15-year-old girls who beat her with an umbrella, causing injuries to the woman's face that required stitches. The girls were arrested at the scene and charged with assault as a hate crime, police said.
In another case, a woman and her boyfriend were attacked on a subway car in Brooklyn by a man who called them slurs before hitting the woman with an umbrella and punching the man, police said. That suspect remains at large.
The jump in hate crimes related to the coronavirus comes as hate crimes fall overall, police said. There were 90 hate crimes recorded by the NYPD between Jan. 1 and March 29 of this year, compared with 112 such crimes during the same period last year.
NYPD Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison said the department is addressing virus-related hate crimes through aggressive policing and educating the public on the importance of following laws as the pandemic grips New York .
""We can't allow this thing to separate us,"" Mr. Harrison said in an interview Wednesday. ""We have to work together, and we can't choose a certain community to blame them in regards to what's going on.""
The NYPD will soon begin a social media campaign to promote a message of unity, he said.

Richard Green, chief executive of a Brooklyn nonprofit called the Crown Heights Youth Collective, said a misguided belief that Chinese people are responsible for the virus may be behind some of the attacks.
""The community needs to be taught that there is not a raciality to it,"" Mr. Green said.
State Assemblyman Ron Kim, a Democrat who represents parts of Queens, said he is planning to host a series of virtual town hall meetings to build solidarity around the pandemic.
""I am beyond disappointed that there are racists out there who are quick to blame and scapegoat us for this,"" said Mr. Kim, who was born in South Korea and raised in Queens.
Overall, crime in New York City has fallen since the virus struck , with the number of arrests falling by nearly 63% for the last week in March, compared with the same week in 2019, according to NYPD statistics.
But certain crimes have spiked, including auto thefts, which were up nearly 39% for that week, compared with the year before.",2900
Virus-Related Discrimination Increases in City,"Yang, Stephanie",Others,2020-04-20,"Coronavirus-related discrimination in New York City is on the rise, particularly against Asian-Americans, prompting the city to establish a new response team to handle the complaints.
The city's Commission on Human Rights said since Feb. 1 it has received 248 complaints of discrimination spurred by fears over Covid- 19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The majority of complaints were made in March and April, and about 42% have been specifically anti-Asian incidents.
The influx of calls prompted the commission to form a task force in early April to address the incidents, including discrimination in housing or employment based on race, age, immigration status or disability. Several of the calls were from disabled or immunocompromised tenants whose landlords or co-op boards had restricted deliveries of groceries or other purchases.
""The response team came together because we saw that we had so many inquiries coming in after this pandemic started,"" said Sapna Raj, deputy commissioner of the commission's law enforcement bureau. ""We realized we needed to respond rapidly to unique issues that New Yorkers were facing.""
The commission acts as a city watchdog and enforces human-rights laws. It can seek civil penalties against an individual or business accused of discrimination.
Between Feb. 1 and April 16, the commission received 105 reports of anti-Asian incidents, compared with five in the same time frame last year. Out of the discrimination reports, 91 were for harassment, five were for housing and nine were for public accommodation.
Hate crimes against Asian-Americans have risen this year as well, while the number of overall crimes in New York City has fallen. Between March 7 and April 2, the New York Police Department received reports of 11 hate crimes related to the disease and made seven arrests.
Following an inquiry, the human-rights commission may advise on a caller's rights and intervene, or open up a longer-term investigation. If the commission determines the complaint to be a hate crime, the case is passed along to the NYPD Hate Crime Task Force.
As the original coronavirus outbreak in China morphed into a global pandemic, Chinese-Americans and others of Asian descent have reported more cases of racism and discrimination. However, broader data on the discrimination is sparse.
Manjusha P. Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, said members of Asian communities may be reluctant to report incidents because of immigration and policing concerns.
She said the organization was alerted to its first coronavirus-related discrimination issue in early February, after a middle-school child in Los Angeles was accused by another student of having the disease. An online form for reporting similar cases that launched on March 19 has garnered about 1,500 responses across 46 states, most notably in California and New York, ranging from refusal of service to physical attacks.
""Even though the numbers are small overall, I think it's an indication of what we're seeing across the country,"" Ms. Kulkarni said. ""All those efforts are important to get a better understanding of the problem.""
Wayne Ho, president of the Chinese-American Planning Council, a nonprofit that provides social services to Asian-Americans, said he started noticing the fallout as early as January, in the form of snide remarks and the avoidance of Chinese businesses.
Mr. Ho said new policies and enforcement of legislation can help protect against discrimination in housing and jobs, but an increase in harassment requires more social outreach.
""I have staff members who have been spit on by people, people have yelled at them or made comments on the subway,"" he said. ""People have thrown everything from pieces of paper to their leftover lunch.""",3806
Stamping out the xenophobia virus,None,Others,2020-04-01,"An Asian woman wearing a mask in a Manhattan subway station was beaten with an umbrella. Another Asian woman in Midtown Manhattan was punched in the face for not wearing a mask. In London, a Singaporean was subjected to what police described as a ""racially aggravated assault"". There are more insults: People have been heard to utter ""coronavirus"" when individuals of Asian origin, particularly with Chinese features, pass by. Other slurs, such as ""kung flu"", have emerged. In times of one of the worst pandemics to afflict humans in a century, fear and foreboding are the order of the day. At last count, the number of Covid-19 cases has crossed 800,000 and deaths have exceeded 38,000. While scapegoating is not uncommon in difficult times, it has since taken on a nasty edge.
The President of the United States, the country with the highest count now of afflicted individuals, has repeatedly called it the ""Chinese virus"". While Mr Donald Trump has eased back on using the term after reports of racially motivated attacks on Asian Americans, his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has stepped up talk of the ""Wuhan virus"". In fact, he squabbled with several Group of Seven peers who wanted him to drop the term. Fortunately, however, there are enough sensible Americans around. They include former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, who made it a point to announce that he would dine in a Chinese restaurant.
The fact remains that China is as much a victim of the Covid-19 pandemic as any other suffering nation. While the origin of the coronavirus is thought to be in Wuhan, there is every chance that some of what is taken as common knowledge today may be upended and reversed in the future. While Beijing should have been more prompt in alerting the world to the virus, this should not be equated with China being responsible for the outbreak. Besides, having taken draconian measures to achieve a measure of control over the pandemic within its borders, it has now embarked on helping many of the most critically affected nations in Europe, Africa and Asia with medical equipment and trained staff on the ground.
Countries, including Singapore, must be especially careful to prevent this other virus - xenophobia - from taking root. While it has had many manifestations in the past, it is currently showing up as Sinophobia. Petitions calling for a ban on travellers from China, as well as religious preachers who post on social media that the outbreak was ""divine retribution"" for China's past actions, do an immense disservice to a nation with claims to having strict adherence to tolerance and multiracialism. While governments can, and should, act against race-based targeting, xenophobia must ultimately be tackled from the ground up. This means that public recognition of the menace - and safe distancing from it - is essential to thwarting it.",2852
"Coronavirus means Chinese students battle rising tide of prejudice in US but fear they may not be welcomed home: Many young people are stranded on campuses in America, and may see more discrimination when they finally make it back to their home country","McCarthy, Simone",Others,2020-04-15,"Yue Qu did not expect to be spending the end of his first year of university alone in his room on a deserted campus in California.
But he had little choice. Despite booking several tickets home to Chengdu, the flights kept getting cancelled with China and other countries imposing restrictions on air travel as the Covid-19 pandemic escalated.
""I have two tickets for May, but I'm not confident that those flights will run. There's no reason for me to be here, and it's a stressful experience staying here all alone,"" he said. Yue is among the roughly 350,000 Chinese students studying at US colleges and universities, the largest group of foreign students in the country.
It is not clear how many have remained in the United States since their campuses shut and other classmates headed home to finish their semesters online.
But students say the pandemic has done more than disrupt travel plans and studies.
It has also brought them face to face with an increase in anti-China sentiment and a surge in racism against Asians and Asian-Americans, and some are questioning what that means for their futures in the US.
Among them is a graduate student in Tennessee who said he was picking up groceries when he overheard two men call him a ""Chinese virus"", a term that has been used by Donald Trump.
""It was just after the 'Chinese virus' was first used on social media, and I was called [that] by two men when I was getting out of my car and wearing a mask,"" he said. The student said the mask made him feel safe from infection, but that he worried his ethnicity put him in danger.
""It changes my feelings about the US and my interest in being in the US. I hope I can be respected and not be attacked when I am living here. To be honest, living in the US is making me feel unsafe right now,"" he said, giving this as the reason he did not want to be named.
The rise in racism against Asians has been well documented, and ABC News recently reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had warned of a potential surge in hate crimes against Asian-Americans in a report sent to law enforcement agencies around the country.
An analysis published on April 8 by the US NGO the Network Contagion Research Institute, which tracks online hate speech, found ""acute increases"" in targeted ethnic hate as well as Sinophobia on niche online forums, with indications this was spilling over onto popular social media sites.
A reporting platform for coronavirus-related discrimination set up late last month by the California-based groups Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council and Chinese for Affirmative Action received over a thousand reports of such incidents in two weeks.
The initiative is a collaboration with San Francisco State University's Asian American Studies Department.
Anxious to avoid confrontations, some Chinese students said they had changed their daily habits.
Eva Chen, a recent graduate working in New York, decided not to wear a mask on the subway to avoid attracting attention.
She felt the rise in racism was linked to American criticisms of Beijing for its management of the outbreak, which made some ""start to blame Chinese people"". New York University student Lyujiang Chen stopped taking the subway altogether after hearing stories of friends being harassed for wearing face masks on trains. He said he loved New York and hoped to work there after he graduated, but was worried about how welcome he would be.
""The thing I'm concerned about is the citizens, what's their opinion about China now? Will they think because the first outbreak was in China that China is responsible for the disaster? I'm not sure about this, so that's something I worry about,"" he said.
Calvin Lei, an anthropology and cognitive science student at Vassar College in New York, said he had felt ""a lot of love"" on a personal level, but witnessing racism in the public sphere and inequalities in the health care system had taught him more about the country.
""It makes me have second thoughts about what it means for me to stay in this country,"" he said. ""America traditionally prides itself on being the country of freedom and diversity, but [all] this does not reflect that spirit.""
As students eye a return to China, they also face concerns back home as authorities there try to contain the rise in imported cases of Covid-19.
These measures have prompted complaints of racism and discrimination against foreigners - most notably in Guangzhou, where Africans are reported to have been evicted from their homes or hotels or subjected to forced quarantine - but Chinese nationals returning from overseas have also faced prejudice.
Students coming home have faced calls that they should be banned from re-entering the country because of concerns they could bring back infections.
Lyujiang Chen, who was able to return to China before flight restrictions were implemented, followed these comments online before and during his 14-day mandatory quarantine and said it made him feel worse.
""It's like we're from some virus area going back to China,"" he said, although he believes this was a fringe opinion that had been amplified by social media.
Yue, who remains on campus in California, has been watching that situation closely, too.
Since the outbreak, he has seen people, some of whom he knows, obviously go out of their way to avoid him.
He also said he was not surprised by the uptick in racism and discrimination, because he knew that these were deep-seated issues in the United States and ""it's just that this virus has brought the Asians to the front of the stage this time"".
But what has surprised him was the opposition to Chinese students coming home.
""There's always this idea that's implanted in me that whatever happens, I'm still a Chinese citizen,"" he said.
""But this attitude online has been pretty saddening. It's like you wanted your family members to appreciate you coming back, but they actually shut the door on you.""",5928
Pandemic stokes fear and brings upswing in hate,"BECKERMANNORTHJERSEYCOM, JIM",Others,2020-04-16,"The Others. Them.
The very words sound sinister. No wonder they became the titles of horror movies.
But they're what we focus on, in a time of fear. Prejudice could be the one thing that spreads more easily than COVID-19.
""In an epidemic, a lot of feelings get very primitive,"" said psychologist and psychoanalyst Spyros D. Orfanos. ""People get very fearful and xenophobic. They need to externalize the blame. They need to find somebody who is at fault for this.""
Groups that can be ""blamed"" for the epidemic — Asians in particular — have been reporting an uptick of bias incidents in the last two months. Groups that have been associated with a particular outbreak, such as Orthodox Jews, have reported the same.
Even the best of us — as we heroically come together to fight a common enemy — are liable to regard our fellow beings with just a wee bit of suspicion.
We worry about The Other — the neighbor we cross the street to avoid, the person in the store we back away from.
And we worry, especially, about people seen as apart from the community — the ones whose ways are unfamiliar, and whose motives are suspect. Them.
""I think in general people are either consciously or unconsciously biased towards other races,"" said Orfanos, director of New York University's postdoctoral program in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. ""And whenever something unexpected or fearful happens, a threat that is unprecedented, it interferes with our thinking.""
Unlike the Others of ""The Others"" (2001) — ghosts — and the Them of ""Them!"" (1954) — giant ants — our other-ing of others right now has a superficial basis in truth. There is, in fact, a disease called COVID-19 that some of us are carrying.
It did originate in a particular country — as all diseases do — though that's pretty much academic, since it's now worldwide. And there have been cases of localized outbreaks connected with some particular groups (and many other outbreaks not connected with them).
But it's telling that the bias incidents tend to be aimed mostly at populations that are already stigmatized. Asians and Jews, in particular.
There's been an incident
Incidents ranging from verbal harassment (67.3%) to physical assault (10%) to being coughed and spat on (2.7%) to being banned from public transportation (1.0%) have been reported by the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, which on April 3 cited over 1,100 reported incidents of anti-Asian bias nationally, clocked over a two-week period.
One such incident was recounted in a Los Angeles Times editorial: ""A white man on open sidewalk approached and stepped directly in front of me and coughed in extremely exaggerated manner in my face — loudly, mouth wide open, about 2 feet from my face, said 'take my virus.'""
There are other such reports. The Asian woman who was punched on West 34th Street by another woman who made anti-Asian slurs (March 10). The man in the New York subway who sprayed air freshener at an Asian passenger (Feb. 6). The Asian student attacked in London by four men who told him, ""We don't want your coronavirus in our country"" (Feb. 24).
Members of the Orthodox Jewish community also started to worry, when an outbreak originating in a New Rochelle synagogue led in March to a ""containment area"" around the town.
""We're seeing stuff online,"" Evan Bernstein, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League's Northeast Division, told the The Journal News and lohud.com on March 4. ""We're getting more and more reports of those comments.""
In Lakewood, tensions have flared between Orthodox Jews — there have been a few cases of weddings held, in violation of rules banning large gatherings — and the rest of the community. A local petition to shut Lakewood down was condemned by Gov. Phil Murphy.
""Scapegoating, bullying, or vilification of any community is completely unacceptable — today or ever,"" Murphy tweeted. ""There is a special place in hell for the small minority that do this during this crisis.""
A surge in anti-Semitic gibes, cartoons and conspiracy theories online, since the COVID crisis hit, has also been reported on the ADL website.
There seem to be two lines of thought, mutually exclusive: that Jews are more likely to have the disease, and that Jews are masterminds who somehow created it, for their own sinister reasons. A Wisconsin white supremacist named ""Uncle"" Paul Nehlen has floated the idea that COVID is a Jewish bioweapon, created in Israel, for the purpose of controlling China. ""You gonna let these jealous, vindictive jews get away with it?"" he posted on the messaging platform Telegram in January.
""I feel like I'm living in the middle ages,"" said American studies professor Michael Aaron Rockland of Rutgers. ""It's the mystery of this thing that has people scared.""
Coronabias
There are also milder forms of bias. The people, for instance, who avoided Chinese restaurants — back when you could still go to restaurants — for what they would say are rational reasons. After all, COVID-19 did originate in China, right? And you don't really know where the waiter might be from, right?
Actually there's no more reason to think that a person of Chinese ancestry had just visited Wuhan than a person of Swedish ancestry had just visited Stockholm. Still, business was down 70% in New York's Chinatown, the trade magazine Restaurant Hospitality reported in March.
But no one reported a comparable downtick in Italian restaurants. Not even in late March, when Italy's death toll surpassed China's, with as many as 250 people dying in a day. No one worried about whether Mario, at the pizzeria, might have just returned from Naples.
Scapegoats — particularly in an epidemic — can also be useful.
COVID has been branded ""Chinese Virus"" and even ""Kung Flu"" by politicians who want to make sure we never forget which ethnic group is to ""blame."" Gays and Haitians were stigmatized for AIDS — labeled a ""gay disease"" even though in some parts of the world, like sub-Saharan Africa, it's largely heterosexual. The English called syphilis ""the French Disease."" The Dutch called rickets ""the English Disease."" The ""Spanish Flu"" — the last modern pandemic comparable to COVID-19 — didn't originate in Spain. It just happened that Spain, being neutral during World War I, was the first to report the disease; other countries suppressed the news for propaganda reasons.
In the early 1900s, the career of ""Typhoid Mary"" Mallon, an Irish cook who infected 51 people in seven families, led to an upswing in anti-Irish prejudice. Irish immigrants were dirty, unsanitary — what more proof did you need than this one bizarre case? You certainly didn't want them cooking your soup or washing your bed linens.
And, of course, the ""Black Death"" pandemic of the 14th century led to hate crimes galore — particularly against Jews, who were burned in large numbers.
Who's afraid?
""The dominant thing is fear of the unknown,"" said Lisa Lyons, a clinical psychologist practicing in Teaneck and New York. ""It's all about the terror of what they don't know. So they blame the outsider: the Asian woman, the Irish cook, the Orthodox Jew.""
The plague-bringer — the invader from somewhere else, bringing contagion — is a very old cultural memory.
You can see it vividly enacted in the classic 1922 silent film ""Nosferatu"" — an early ""Dracula"" movie that taps into medieval ideas about disease. In the film, a ghost ship sails into the town harbor at night. A gaunt stranger — the vampire — disembarks, followed by hundreds of plague rats. A few days later, the streets are full of funerals.
""Nosferatu! Was it he who brought the plague to Bremen in 1838?"" reads a title card.
The Other might be personified as vampires — a tuberculosis epidemic in 19th-century New England was, in fact, blamed on them. Or it might be any ethnic, social or religious group that is considered out of the mainstream.
""You can tell people that, and they will even say themselves that this is ridiculous,"" Rockland said. ""But there's a part of them that still believes it. Things don't happen without some sort of conspiracy.""",8049
"For Asians, COVID-19 + racism = extra anxiety","Ao, Bethany",Others,2020-04-23,"IN early March, Yuming Wang, a Philadelphia lawyer, watched with increasing concern reports of racist incidents against Asian Americans over coronavirus fears trickle in from other cities. A Chinese woman was attacked for wearing a mask in New York City. A 16-year-old Asian American student was physically assaulted in Los Angeles.
Wang, who is the honorary chairman of the Pennsylvania United Chinese Coalition, decided to create a WeChat group for Chinese Americans who were worried about the rising numbers of racist incidents during the pandemic. Soon after, he began working closely with state and local police, the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations, and other law enforcement agencies to encourage Chinese Americans who experience racist incidents to report them.
""Chinese Americans have been increasingly worried about their safety every day, and the issue is getting deeper and deeper into their mental health concerns,"" Wang said. ""Among [the group members], the biggest concern is that when someone goes somewhere, [they] may be attacked, verbally or physically, because of being Asian or Chinese Americans.""
Many Philadelphians are reluctant to leave their homes because of fears over contracting COVID-19. But members of the city's Asian American communities have an additional worry - many are growing increasingly anxious about dealing with racist incidents, which can lead to negative mental health effects.
The link between racism and mental health
The number of hate crimes against Asian Americans has been decreasing for 15 years, according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Report data from 2003 to 2017. But in late March, federal law enforcement began to warn communities that hate crimes against Asian Americans will increase as the coronavirus crisis goes on.
This concerned mental health experts, as a growing body of research indicates a link between racial discrimination and anxiety and depression. In a 2013 review of 121 studies on the effects of racism on youth, researchers found that youth who experienced discrimination were significantly more likely to suffer from mental health problems. A 2007 study that surveyed 2,047 Asian Americans identified racial discrimination as a significant predictor of mental health disorders over a 12-month period.
""When people are treated unfairly, it can create a stress response called allostatic load,"" said Gilbert Gee, a professor in the department of community health sciences at the Fielding School of Public Health at the University of California Los Angeles. ""Allostatic load can impair the body in many ways, such as weakening our immune systems.""
Even before the pandemic began, Asian American communities were considered a high-risk group among mental health experts. Survey data from the 2011 National Latino and Asian American Study found that Asian American women have a 17% chance of developing a psychiatric disorder over their lifetime, and they are three times less likely to seek mental health services than white women are. Results from the 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found only 6.3% of Asian Americans who were age 18 and over received mental health services in 2017, compared with 18.6% of white people.
Racism against Asian Americans has existed for centuries - COVID-19-related violence is just a recent iteration. Kevin Nadal, a psychologist and professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice whose research focuses on the mental health effects of microaggressions, said it's important to acknowledge that the fear of experiencing racism is very real.
""Even if people aren't experiencing direct incidents, just the knowledge of it can cause them to feel anxious, depressed, or hypervigilant, which can lead to other mental health issues,"" Nadal said. ""It's a collective trauma - the anticipation comes from people of your shared identity having experienced violence.""
Hate speech on social media is one example. In a study conducted by Gee, early results from an analysis of nearly one million tweets between November and March suggest that negative comments about Asians increased about 70%. Gee also found that negative comments about Asians increased 167% the week after President Donald Trump used the phrase China virus during a news conference.
""It's really important to acknowledge that language matters and has a direct effect on marginalized communities that may be targeted,"" said Nadal, who was not involved in the study. ""When the president assigned blame to China instead of acknowledging that this virus, like most viruses, can come from a number of places, he definitely emboldens people to act out on their racism.""
'Discrimination against Asians protects nobody'
Min Son and her family began wearing masks to grocery stores in March, even before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended everyone wear a mask. But they worried that the masks could make them a target.
""We were super cautious whenever we had to go outside,"" said Son, a senior at Ursinus College. ""Our president calling COVID-19 a 'Chinese virus' also played a part into our fear of discrimination. I am not Chinese, but to others, I may look like one. And I am not more vulnerable against this virus than other races. Viruses don't discriminate, and discrimination against Asians protects nobody.""
The stress that results from anticipating racism can negatively affect the immune system, according to Suzanne Chong, a psychologist at Ursinus College.
""The immune system will be temporarily put on half for the body to be vigilant for possible threatening situations,"" she said. ""The anticipation of harassment might manifest as somatic symptoms of headaches, gastrointestinal disturbances, physical aches and pains, and an inability to fight off infections.""
Chong emphasized that people should not feel alone in facing fears over discrimination and race-based attacks. She pointed out that many organizations, like the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, have condemned anti-Asian American rhetoric. She also encouraged people to reach out for support from friends, family members, community and religious leaders, and mental health professionals because ""acknowledging the reality of racism and the impact . . . will help dispel the heaviness and burden of being targets.""
Chong encouraged people to speak out if they see someone being rude or making racist slurs, if they feel safe doing so. ""Offer your empathy and be an ally against racism,"" she said. ""Your presence is the best salve against acts of cruelty.""
Nadal expects the impacts of coronavirus-fueled racism to be long lasting. He said the psychological effects of discriminatory acts by the U.S. government like the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 and Japanese internment in the 1940s are still felt today.
""The Asian American community is so diverse,"" Nadal said. ""People are going to experience this differently, just like how after 9/11, East Asian Americans might not have experienced the targeting of Arab Americans or South Asians. But we have to care about it, whether or not it personally affects us. We have to be just as vigilant as if it was happening in our own communities.""",7169
Asian-Americans Won't Stop Discrimination By Helping To Fight Covid-19,"Lerner, Mitchell",Others,2020-04-24,"Among the many appalling consequences of covid-19 has been an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans. Verbal harassment has been common, but acts of violence are on the upswing as well. In Texas, a man allegedly tried to kill an Asian family in a grocery store (which included stabbing a 2-year-old child.)
Although the increasing harassment has been widely condemned, some voices have also suggested that the virus represents an opportunity for Asian Americans to prove themselves as good and patriotic Americans, and thus help eradicate such racial animosity. Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang recently argued in The Washington Post that Asian Americans ""need to embrace and show our American-ness in ways we never have before... We should show without a shadow of a doubt that we are Americans who will do our part for our country in this time of need."" History, however, suggests that such an effort is not only unlikely to succeed but runs the risk of generating a backlash that might exacerbate violence.
Almost exactly a century ago, African Americans faced similar calls to prove themselves in the midst of a war, a pandemic and an economic recession. The black community was not blamed for starting World War I in the way that Asian Americans have been blamed for the coronavirus. They were, however, disproportionately singled out as potential traitors, since their standing as second-class citizens allegedly made them particularly susceptible to offers to betray their country.
This suspicion exposed African Americans to intense scrutiny and hostility Government officials warned the black press against any sign of disloyalty and editors came under suspicion and harassment. The editor of the San Antonio Inquirer was sentenced to two years in prison for publishing an article supporting a group of African American soldiers on trial for their part in a race riot.
Black citizens faced worse treatment at the hands of suspicious white neighbors. When a troublemaking student in a local black school falsely claimed that his teachers were encouraging disloyalty the white community in Lake Village, Ark., formed a ""home guard"" of vigilantes to put down the nonexistent threat of a revolt. The result was terrifying for the black community. In the words of one vigilante, through their ""prompt and vigorous manner"" Lake Village's white citizens made clear to the black community ""that at all times they will be kept under strict surveillance"" and ""the first one that fails to obey the injunction of the president ... will be dealt with accordingly."" The vigilante quoted was the town's deputy prosecuting attorney.
In response to such threats, African Americans embraced the war as an opportunity to prove their American-ness. ""The colored man,"" wrote the principal of the African American Hampton Institute in 1917, ""is goingto secure recognition not by demanding his rights, but by deserving them... We are all Americans together and must stand shoulder to shoulder in this crisis."" The same week, 350 African Americans in Hartsville, Term., met in their segregated school to swear an oath pledging"" our loyalty to the Stars and Stripes, the government under which we live, to our president and our governor, that we stand ready now to play our part in any way that the honor, dignity integrity of this nation of ours might be defended.""
African American actions matched their rhetoric. Many rushed to fight in the war, even though, at first, there was little room for them in the segregated military. The exigencies of the war, however, soon forced a revision of such policies. In the end, more than 2 million registered for the draft and more than 360,000 served, with 42,000 seeing combat. Most served in labor units but two segregated combat divisions fought in France, generally performing with honor and distinction. The 369th infantry regiment spent more time on the front lines than any other American unit, and 171 of its members received the Croix de Guerre medal from the French government.
Although African Americans fought for numerous reasons, the war's promise as an opportunity to earn their rightful status at home was a critical part. One soldier enlisted despite being too old to be drafted, and was soon sent to fight overseas. ""Now is our opportunity to prove what we can do,"" he explained.",4342
"Naperville working toward broad steps to address race, inclusion -BYLN- By Marie Wilson mwilson@dailyherald.com",None,Others,2020-04-22,"Naperville working toward broad steps to address race, inclusion The city of Naperville is considering several action steps to address race-related concerns, which recently have included comments offensive to Asian Americans and a battery that remains under investigation.
City council members, during a virtual meeting Tuesday, thanked two Chinese leaders for stepping up to condemn a series of remarks that were read into the record during a meeting April 7 and an attack reported March 21.
Nancy Chen and Bill Liu both asked the council to denounce these and other actions that they say have unfairly stereotyped and singled out Asian American people, especially in light of the coronavirus pandemic.
Chen called on the city to adopt a resolution to end racism and hate crimes. The suggested resolution she read aloud drew support from several council members.
But City Manager Doug Krieger said, instead of adopting a resolution or proclamation, the city plans to roll out a broader diversity and inclusion plan that has been in the works for several months.
Work toward the plan began after two high-profile episodes of unrest last fall, one involving a multiracial group of 18 asked to move at Buffalo Wild Wings because staffers said two white customers did not want to sit by them, and another involving a 14-year-old white student who posted an ad online showing a photo of a black classmate with the words ""Slave for Sale (NAPERVILLE).""
The city in December updated its mission statement to include a focus on ""creating an inclusive community that values diversity."" Krieger said a future diversity plan will include recommendations related to the staff members and partner organizations, taking into account feedback received from the U.S. Department of Justice. The plan is expected to come before the council May 19.
The plan could help address concerns raised by Chen and Liu, who said some recent actions have served to divide the city.
Chen said a Chinese American man jogging on a trail March 21 ""was physically attacked by two women who spit on him and yelled at him to go back to China.""
Naperville Crime Stoppers is offering a reward of up to $1,000 for information that leads to an arrest in the case. Police are investigating.
A few weeks later, comments submitted by Erika DeCarlo during the city’s first virtual council meeting called Asian members of an Opt Out group advocating against recreational marijuana sales ""roving carpetbaggers"" and made remarks Chen and Liu said they found hurtful.
""I cannot disagree more with Ms. DeCarlo’s depiction of many Naperville citizens of Chinese descent who support the Opt Out as carpetbaggers,"" Liu said. ""The portrayal was demeaning and highly offensive.""
Council members echoed Chen’s and Liu’s denouncement of the remarks, with everyone on the panel saying there is no place in Naperville and no place in public discourse for such statements.
Council member Benny White said he is meeting with Krieger later this week to discuss steps toward a potential commission or other framework to address race-related issues. He also has been hosting a series of Naperville Neighbors United meetings to promote dialogue around race and inclusion.",3206
"Asian Americans go online to tell of verbal, physical abuse in US","de Souza, Alison",Others,2020-04-02,"More than 1,000 Asian Americans have logged on to a website to share stories of being verbally and physically attacked - many coughed at and spat upon - because the coronavirus originated in China.
A gun-store owner in Los Angeles County - home to the largest population of Asians in the United States at 1.5 million - told The Straits Times he has seen a surge in Asian customers in recent months, many of them first-time buyers.
There are certainly compelling reasons for Asian Americans to be fearful these days.
A Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) analysis, obtained by ABC News, ""assesses that hate crime incidents against Asian Americans likely will surge across the US... based on the assumption that a portion of the US public will associate Covid-19 with China and Asian-American populations"".
At a Texas supermarket last month, a man stabbed a Chinese-American family, including children aged two and six, because he thought the family was infecting people with the virus.
Hundreds of news reports about similar incidents this year prompted Dr Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University, to set up an online reporting centre for personal accounts of such experiences.
Launched on March 19 with the help of two California-based advocacy groups - the Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council, and Chinese for Affirmative Action - the Stop AAPI Hate website (www.a3pcon.org/stopaapihate) has amassed more than 1,000 reports, or about 100 a day, as of March 30.
""On a political level, we need to document what's going on,"" Dr Jeung explains.
""And track trends so we can have appropriate interventions at the community or policy level.""
And the initiative offers guidance for those who submit stories, ""like what to do when your kid is bullied or you face workplace discrimination"". Some striking trends are emerging from the submissions.
NOT AN ABSTRACTION
I was waiting at a grocery store when an older white woman wearing a mask shouted a profanity at me, pulled off her mask and theatrically coughed in my direction. I was the only non-white person in the line. I think we've reached that point where (Asians) are no longer feeling this as an abstraction.
MR JEFF YANG, a Taiwanese-American journalist and author who recently tweeted about an encounter and got a flood of responses about similar experiences.
DREAD AND STRESS
My wife got coughed at a park, and my son and I were shunned at a sporting goods store; it was a small incident but it was noticeable. Like a lot of Asian Americans, we're now hyper aware of how people perceive us. And it just adds to the dread and stress over the upcoming surge of cases and deaths from the disease itself.
DR RUSSELL JEUNG, a professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University, who set up an online reporting centre - the Stop AAPI Hate website - for personal accounts of such experiences.
Almost 90 per cent cite ""race"" as the reason for discrimination, with two-thirds of incidents involving verbal harassment. Three times more women than men have filed reports, and only 40 per cent of victims are Chinese.
Other Asian ethnicities, or ""anybody who looks Chinese"", can be targeted too, says Dr Jeung.
Sifting through these accounts has been ""harrowing and depressing"", he admits. Those who write in speak of being called names, having bottles thrown at them and Uber drivers refusing to pick them up.
""It's been hard to see how much hate there is and how virulent people's prejudices are,"" says the professor. And the bigotry, he believes, has not been helped by US President Donald Trump, who ""insisted on calling it 'the Chinese virus'"".
The identities of those who write in are kept confidential, but Dr Jeung, who is Chinese American, shares that he, his Korean-American wife and their son have experienced discrimination too.
""My wife got coughed at a park, and my son and I were shunned at a sporting goods store; it was a small incident but it was noticeable,"" says the 57-year-old.
""Like a lot of Asian Americans, we're now hyper aware of how people perceive us. And it just adds to the dread and stress over the upcoming surge of cases and deaths from the disease itself.""
Other Asian Americans feel the same.
Ms Kristine Villanueva, a Filipino American in Washington DC, had an ugly experience a month ago.
The 26-year-old editor for a non-profit news organisation was returning to her apartment when a stranger began yelling at her.
The African-American man followed her inside and ""asked our concierge why she was talking to me, and kept calling me 'a dirty b***h with the flu'"" before he was asked to leave.
Mr Jeff Yang, a Taiwanese-American journalist and author, recently tweeted about an encounter of his own and got a flood of responses about similar experiences.
""I was waiting at a grocery store when an older white woman wearing a mask shouted a profanity at me, pulled off her mask and theatrically coughed in my direction.
""I was the only non-white person in the line.""
""I think we've reached that point where (Asians) are no longer feeling this as an abstraction,"" says the 52-year-old.

Vancouver sees surge in attacks on East Asian people,"Hager, Mike",Others,2020-04-23,"Vancouver police are reporting a recent spike in hateful attacks against East Asian people amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with the force issuing a public appeal to identify the middle-aged suspect in the shocking assault of a 92-year-old man at a convenience store.
On Wednesday, the police released surveillance video of a March 13 attack and said that five of the 11 hate crimes reported in the city last month targeted East Asian people.
This year, there have been nine hate crimes against people of this ethnic background, a total that already represents three quarters of all hate crimes reported against this group last year.
""Five of them were specific to what's going on right on with COVID-19 with an anti-Asian element,"" Constable Tania Visintin, a Vancouver Police Department spokeswoman, told The Globe and Mail on Wednesday.
""Not only are we going through a pandemic and its added stress on everybody - whether it be mentally and financially - and now this is happening to this type of ethnicity? ""It's not right and we're not going to tolerate it.""
Constable Visintin could not say how many suspects in these recent hate-crime cases have had charges recommended against them or provide more complete data on how many hate crimes were reported in the city last year and against which groups.
Police across the country don't typically release up-todate statistics on hate crimes, so it is unclear whether other police departments are seeing a similar uptick in attacks against East Asian people amid the global pandemic that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
Hate-crime data across the country are collected from police each year by Statistics Canada, but it can take up to two years before this information is released to the public. Toronto has seen no notable increase in hate crimes over the past month and a half, Toronto Police Service spokeswoman Meaghan Gray said.
""However, we also know that hate-related occurrences often go unreported to police so I'm not sure our numbers would accurately reflect the possible lived experiences for some members of the community,"" Ms. Gray said in an e-mailed statement.
In 2018, the latest data available from Statistics Canada, there were 56 hate crimes reported to police that targeted East Asian or Southeast Asian people, out of a total of 780 hate crimes motivated by race or ethnicity.
John Paul Catungal, assistant professor at UBC's Institute for Gender, Race, Sexuality and Social Justice, said he is not surprised by Vancouver's reported spike in attacks against East Asian people as this sentiment has become a global phenomenon because of the coronavirus.
In the United States, where President Donald Trump has drawn criticism for calling COVID-19 the ""China virus,"" the FBI recently warned local police forces that hate crimes against Americans with Asian backgrounds will likely surge, according to ABC News, which obtained an internal report.
On Wednesday, Vancouver police released surveillance footage from the convenience store that shows a fiftysomething white man yelling at the senior East Asian man who suffers from dementia.
""I can't get into specifics, but they were racially motivated slurs and comments and they had to do with COVID-19 and they were anti-Asian comments,"" Constable Visintin said at a news conference.
The suspect, who was wearing a black T-shirt with the logo of a Canadian charity that supports injured motorcycle riders, then grabs the man and forcefully walks him out the door, giving him a final push that sends the senior toppling backward onto the sidewalk where he hits his head. The suspect, who was wearing gold rings, a gold bracelet and a gold chain, then walks outside and picks the victim up and sits him down on the pavement beside a slipper that had fallen off.
The suspect then calmly walks back into the store to pay for his goods.
""This could have been a lot worse, we're so thankful that this man who suffers from severe dementia is okay,"" Constable Visintin said. ""He is at home, he's with his family and he is uninjured.""",4044
Manhattan woman takes stand following racial remarks,"Smith, Sherman",Others,2020-04-12,"TOPEKA — Fanny Fang’s immediate reaction to a Riley County commissioner’s racist remarks involved a profane two-word outburst and reflection on whether she had made a mistake by returning to Kansas a couple of years ago.
Then the Manhattan woman, whose family owns and operates the Asian Market grocery store, realized how much she appreciates the community’s support.
After Commissioner Marvin Rodriguez suggested the threat of COVID-19 was low in the community because there were no Chinese people — he later offered a tepid apology while noting his affinity for Chinese food — Fang refused to perpetuate the “model minority myth,” as she called it, “where we keep to ourselves and don’t say anything.”
Instead, Fang has been outspoken about the harassment of Asian Americans. She and others have called for Rodriguez to resign.
Fang returned to Manhattan a couple of years ago after studying at New York University. This is where her parents chose to make a home in 1997 when they immigrated from a rural area of China. Before opening the grocery store, the family owned a restaurant in town.
“There was one day I picked up the phone and someone asked me if my family cooked cats and dogs,“ Fang said. ”This was when I was 10. And now at the age of 24, I’ve got a local politician saying these things about Chinese people and COVID-19. So even 14 years later, it’s still happening in this community. And it always will.
“The difference now is I’m not 10 — I’m 24, and I now have the ability to say something. I’m not scared anymore. I have a very strong support system. I’m in this. I know it’s going to be a fight, but if I’m going to go into a fight with anybody, I’m so glad to do it with Manhattan, Kansas.”
Fang said her anxiety skyrocketed when she heard COVID-19 broke out in China, fearing racist reaction in the United States. She has been asked in her store, sometimes by children, if she has the virus. And she watched the terrifying video of an attack on an Asian American woman in New York City, who suffered chemical burns when a man poured liquid on her as she took out the trash.
That anxiety was heightened by Rodriguez’s remarks during a commission meeting last month, as reported by the Manhattan Mercury.
“I know that other people are having a great problem,” he said. “And someone reminded me that in Italy, they have a lot of garment-people there, fashionists, and they have a tremendous amount of Chinese there, and that’s where a lot of it started. So we don’t necessarily have any (Chinese people), but I think the board would like to make sure that we’re on top of it.”
Fang’s immediate response: “Excuse my language for this, but it felt like a big f*** you.”
“I just can’t say it any other way,” she said. “It made me question why I even came back to this community.”
When Fang confronted Rodriguez at a subsequent meeting, he “apologized for the remarks and how they may have hurt people.”
“That’s not how I think,“ he said. ”I have everybody on my mind ... and I’ve got a lot of Chinese food here, and I’ve got some Chinese friends and stuff.”
Rodriguez didn’t return a phone call seeking comment for this story.
As a county commissioner, Rodriguez also serves on the county’s board of health. Shana Bender, an organizer for the Manhattan Alliance for Peace and Justice, questioned the effect his “plainly racist” remarks would have on the rest of the department.
“How are they going to respond in a global crisis?“ Bender said. “What does that mean for our minorities who come for emergency services? Will there be a bias in place? Will this put people at further harm because of their internal bias?”
  Dennis Butler, director of the Riley County Police Department, welcomed feedback from Asian Americans who feel unsafe or wish to report bias or a hate crime.
“Violence, threats of violence, bias and hate crimes directed toward Asian Americans is as unacceptable as it is against any persons who are targeted because of what they look like or where they come from,” Butler said. “Any bias-based crimes reported to the Riley County Police Department will be vigorously investigated.”
Kansas Rep. Rui Xu, a Democrat from Westwood, said words have an effect on Asian Americans living in the United States.
“I keep making the point that nobody’s confused about where this virus is from,“ Xu said. ”Nobody’s confused that China probably hid this for at least a couple of weeks, or at least hid the numbers. Nobody is on the other side of that issue. But for Asian Americans, this is actually dangerous for us here. I know what you’re trying to do. I get it. But it’s actually harming people here, so you’ve got to stop.”
Health officials in Kansas have documented 50 deaths and 1,268 infections from the coronavirus, which first was detected in the state in early March. So far, 20 Riley County residents have tested positive for COVID-19.
Gov. Laura Kelly has issued a series of high-profile executive orders, including a statewide mandate to stay at home except for essential needs, as part of her administration’s response to the pandemic.
“I abhor any acts of aggression, particularly when they are motivated by race, gender, sexual orientation, whatever, so I would ask Kansans to please not do that,“ Kelly said. ”This is no one person’s fault, no one ethnic group’s fault. This is a pandemic that we all have responsibility to make sure it goes away, and we need to do our part.”
Sometimes, Fang wonders if it would be safer to close the market and recede into the shadows.
For her, that isn’t an option. She plans to continue to push for Rodriguez to resign and, in the alternate, vote him out of office later this year.
“My hope is that the 13-, 14-, 15-year-old Asian American at Manhattan High sees that someone in this community who looks like them is speaking up,“ Fang said, ”and I hope that if they stay here or if they go somewhere else, they will remember this and say, ’I can do this.’ That’s what I hope.”",5956
Jugaad series will address cultural myths amid COVID-19,"Berg, Jenny",Others,2020-04-26,"""We're connecting and sharing information with our audience.""
Emmanuel Oppong
Board member for Jugaad Leadership Program
As COVID-19 started to spread across American communities, so too did misinformation.
A prevalent rumor on social media was that black people can't get the coronavirus — which is particularly detrimental because black people are dying from COVID-19 at much higher rates than other races.
""So despite the fact that there are CDC guidelines out there and World Health Organization guidelines out there, there are communities that are getting misinformation,"" said Emmanuel Oppong. ""So we are using our platform to state the facts.""
Oppong, the community engagement director for the city of St. Cloud, is a board member for Jugaad Leadership Program, which trains and connects the next generation of leaders — specifically minority leaders — with members of local boards and commissions, as well as internships and employment.
The program is hosting a weekly online series, ""Demystifying Cultural Myths."" The first presentation, which focused on physical health amid the COVID-19 pandemic, launched Friday.
""It's meant to educate marginalized communities within Central Minnesota,"" Oppong said.
Friday's session featured Dr. Olayiwola R. Adetunji, a physician at CentraCare, who talked about the virus and how it spreads.
He also debunked myths he's heard — ranging from claims that gargling bleach can protect someone from the virus to claims that the virus is spread by mosquitoes.
He also addressed myths that people can contract the virus from eating Chinese food or that black people cannot get sick from the disease.
""The virus knows no race,"" Adetunji said.
Minnesota Department of Health statistics show white people make up more than 50% of confirmed cases in the state, while black people make up about 15% of cases.
But the data is constantly changing and not completely reliable — in nearly 20% of confirmed cases, the patient's race is unknown. But stories chronicling disparities are widespread.
In Louisiana, as USA Today reported last week, 70% of coronavirus-related deaths were black patients — even though they comprise less than a third of the state's population.
Minorities could be more vulnerable to complications from the COVID-19 virus because of underlying health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease, Adetunji said.
""Those will increase the severity of the illness and likewise the mortality,"" he said.
The Demystifying Cultural Myths series will stream from 5:30-6:30 Fridays via Zoom and Facebook Live.
After presenters share information, participants are able to ask questions. A recording will be available after the live event at www.facebook.com/jugaadleadership.
Upcoming sessions include emotional well-being, cross-cultural understanding and discrimination, transportation and public safety, and community resources and workforce.
Oppong, as well as Jugaad board members Eunice Adjei, Ryan Daniel, Dr. Sangeeta Jha and Jonathan Wong will present information and help lead discussions. ""The series is meant to bridge-build,"" Oppong said. ""We're connecting and sharing information with our audience.""
Daniel, the chief executive officer at St. Cloud Metro Bus, will present on transportation.
""A lot of people are wondering why Metro Bus continues to operate,"" Daniel said. ""Quite frankly, we are essential.
""Transportation is deemed an essential service,"" he continued. ""We may not be essential to everyone, however, for transit-dependent people in our communities, we are the lifeline. We provide the link to get people to the hospital, medical appointments, the grocery store, to the essential jobs, etc.""
Daniel said the transportation session will cover steps the organization is doing to protect drivers and riders — such as going fare-free to limit the use of frequently touched objects and having passengers use the rear door.
The session will also look ahead at what transportation might look like post-pandemic.
""Once this comes and goes, we're going to have to provide transportation in a different way,"" Daniel said. ""We can't go fare-free forever so we're looking for alternatives.""
A shared experience —but discrimination persists
Jha, a professor at St. Cloud Technical & Community College, will present on cross-cultural understanding.
""I am an anthropologist and a sociologist so for me culture is a concept which ... literally influences how we think about everything, including health,"" she said.
Despite cultural differences — and conflicts that sometimes arise due to those differences — everyone is going through a similar process of grappling with the pandemic.
""This is the first time, I would say, the entire world is in the same boat, the same situation, at least in my lifetime,"" she said. Still, discrimination persists.
""I have (Asian American) friends who are really afraid to go to a store and just clear their throat, or just cough or sneeze. I have a friend who doesn't go out for a walk because she is afraid to go out by herself,"" Jha said. ""Basically, people are not feeling safe. ... There might not be reported cases (of discrimination) but this is going around.""
Adjei, the program's founder, will focus on helping minority-owned small businesses tap into funding designated to help with COVID-19 fallout. ""When it comes to small businesses, we know that minorities are the most affected ones,"" Adjei said.
For example, many minority-owned businesses are not eligible for relief due to requirements they have two or more staff because many businesses have family members helping out, Adjei said.
Although the series is only scheduled to last for another month, the Zoom meetings could continue ""because we need a platform where we can talk about these cultural issues through a cross-cultural perspective,"" Jha said.
Ultimately, the goal is to create connections — even during a time of social distancing.
""We hope this will bring us together as a community to lean on each other and also learn from each other,"" Adjei said.

Nepalis in London on the receiving end of xenophobia amidst Covid-19 fears,None,Others,2020-04-24,"Nepal, April 24 -- On Wednesday, April 15, Milan Limbu was playing video games in his room when he heard a loud explosion. At first, he thought it was the sound of fireworks. But it was 11 pm in the otherwise quiet neighbourhood of Maidstone, an English town south-east of London. Limbu looked out the window to find his parents' car on fire.
The police and fire department were called, and the conclusion was arson-the car had deliberately been set on fire. For Limbu, the son of Ram Kumar Limbu, a former British Gurkha, it was an attack that he'd never experienced before in Maidstone, a small town that is known as a Gurkha enclave in England.
""It was an attack on my family, on our house,"" said Limbu.
But that wasn't to be the only attack on the Gurkha community that night. Barely an hour after Limbu's parents' car was set afire, another car belonging to Basanta Maden, also a former British Gurkha and Limbu's neighbour, was burned.
Ratna Limbu, Milan's uncle, believes that the arson attacks were racially motivated.
""We have been deeply saddened and, at the same time, badly shaken up by these incidents,"" he said. ""I am afraid that my family might also be the target of a hate crime.""
The arson attacks on Limbu and Maden are by no means isolated incidents. In recent days, physical and verbal attacks against the Nepali community in England are becoming much more common. Many believe that this has to do with the Covid-19 pandemic, which has sparked racism and anti-Asian xenophobia across the world.
Last month, when Roshan Gurung was walking on the street of Bristol, a man directed an angry rant at him from his car.
""It was the first time that I faced racism. I get chills even remembering the incident. The man yelled at me, saying at what price I was selling bats and then he sarcastically congratulated me for spreading Covid-19,"" said Gurung.
On March 18, Haushala Thapa Zimba reported being the target of a comment by a passerby who accused her of having brought the ""virus"" to England.
""Until then, I had never been harassed for my race. So, when racist slurs were used against me, I felt shocked, angry and unsafe at the same time. I felt like people were judging me based on my appearance,"" said Zimba.
As the number of Covid-19 cases rises, fear and anxiety over the potentially deadly disease have led individuals and groups to scapegoat Chinese people and those of Asian descent. Throughout history, whenever there is a major incident with global or regional implications, people have sought to allocate blame to certain vulnerable populations in order to calm their own fears.
For instance, during the H1N1 swine flu outbreak in 2009, Mexicans and many Latinos were scapegoated whereas people of African descent were scrutinised during the 2014 Ebola outbreak.
There is evidence that wherever outbreaks take place, people scapegoat groups that are already marginalised and treated as ""the other.""
Narayani Devkota, a lecturer at Tribhuvan University's Sociology Department, said that the Nepali community in the UK has become a target of racist crimes amidst the outbreak of Covid-19 because they have long been regarded as ""the other"" in the predominantly white society.
""Nepalis in the UK are racially distinct immigrants who are in the minority. They are also regarded as comparatively poor in socio-economic status. These reasons may have further triggered the racially motivated act against them during the outbreak,"" said Devkota.
According to Neelima Limbu, a resident of Dover, harassment against the Nepali community existed even before the outbreak of Covid-19.
""I work in a supermarket and I have faced comments such as 'go back to your country' several times, even before the corona outbreak,"" said Limbu. ""Most of the time, these attackers are a small disruptive group of individuals, such as uneducated people and kids.""
Neelima, however, said misinformation regarding Covid-19 and its association with a certain ethnicity has only contributed to the hostility towards Nepalis.
""Since the media has been Covid-19 with pictures of Asian people, many have started scapegoating Nepalis on the basis of their appearance, as there are many Nepalis who resemble East Asians,"" he said.
The repeated use of photos of Asians alongside news about Covid-19 could contribute to the xenophobia Asians already face, according to Kainaz Amaria, the American news outlet Vox's visuals editor.
""News outlets must ask themselves-Are the photographs further stigmatizing a particular community or perpetuating stereotypes?"" said Amaria.
As for the arson attacks, Dinesh Khadka, a Maidstone borough councillor, said that the police are investigating the cases and five people have been taken into custody on suspicion of involvement. Khadka, however, doesn't believe that the arson attacks were racially motivated.
""I have spent around 19 years in this locality, and I have never come across a racially motivated crime against the Nepali community,"" he said. ""There are around a thousand Nepalis living in Maidstone and people love and respect British Gorkhas. We should see this as an arson attack that happened to be on Nepalis, rather than as a racially motivated crime against Nepalis.""
Khadka reported that the Maidstone community has successfully raised the total of 1,000 pounds for victims of the arson attacks as a gesture of solidarity. But not everyone shares Khadka's optimism.
Alan Mercel-Sanca, chief executive officer of the UK-Nepal Friendship Society, said that the arson attacks were ""symptomatic of a much broader engrained problem of anti- Asian racism"".
In an email that was sent to community leaders and council members, Mercel-Sanca urged the authorities to monitor and act to prevent racially motivated crimes against British Gorkhas.
Even officials at the Nepali Embassy in London believe that the attacks were a result of racial stereotyping.
""We believe that the Maidstone incidents were racially motivated,"" said Sarad Raj Aran, deputy chief of mission at the Nepali embassy. ""We are concerned that if such crimes keep happening, racist acts against Nepalis may continue, even after the pandemic is over.""",6157
Anti-Asian 'Zoombombers' intrude on Asheville chef: Interruption highlights troubling COVID-19 trends,"Gordon, Brian",Others,2020-04-13,"ASHEVILLE – J Chong had her culinary lesson set. Pesto pasta, made from ingredients she discovered in her cupboards, would make for a flavorful, accessible meal, one her homebound audience could replicate through their computer screens.
The Asheville-based Campaign for Southern Equality had invited Chong to lead this free, virtual cooking tutorial for its The Front Porch series of community webinars. The 42-year-old Chong, who serves on the CSE board, had already posted a few meal demonstrations on her Instagram during the coronavirus outbreak. Doing another with CSE seemed like a perfect fit.
""To me, cooking is easy,"" said Chong, an executive sous chef with Katie Button Restaurants. ""But when we're stuck at home and some are homeschooling and some have kids, cooking can be very stressful. I like to offer some help to the community.""
Minutes before the lesson began on Zoom, a video conferencing platform, Chong received a brief warning from a CSE staff member: ""There may be some people who interrupt the class."" Chong didn't give the caution much concern.
  ""No biggie,"" she thought. ""If it happens then we will work through it.""
Held in the afternoon of March 27, the lesson started seamlessly. Chong's wife, Danielle, filmed and CSE staff monitored the Zoom video stream, handling any technical difficulties and booting out any unwelcome guests. Around 10 attendees signed on to watch Chong turn spinach, parmesan, parsley, dill, and some almonds into a thick pesto sauce.
About half an hour into the lesson, after Chong tossed the sauce with cooked penne and was preparing to take audience questions, several new accounts flooded in the video stream.
Chong's first thought: ""Cool, more people are joining.""
Instead, the new entrants began spewing a string of slurs toward Chong. Both verbally and on Zoom's chat feature, the intruders got off a torrent of anti-Asian and homophobic epithets before CSE staff scrambled to block off all accounts. While the entire episode lasted around 20 seconds, those listening in said it seemed much longer.
""It felt like forever,"" said Al Murray, CSE's director of engagement and organizational development. ""It was infuriating. It was heartbreaking. J is an incredible human and just walks through the world with so much kindness. She is the last person I'd wish this upon.""
Chong, for her part, remained stoic. ""I am a queer Asian, and those words I've heard all my life,"" she said. ""My wife told me I didn't flinch while it was happening.""
While few words in a xenophobe's vocabulary can shake Chong, one line uttered during her cooking tutorial was new. Never before had she received the taunt: ""The coronavirus is happening because of you.""
Anti-Asian hate in the time of COVID-19
The intrusion into J Chong's pesto pasta lesson represented two broad trends of the COVID-19 outbreak: disruptive video chat ""bombings"" and growing incidents - both nationally and locally - of discrimination against Asian- Americans.
Social distancing, working from home, and remote schooling have bolstered the prevalence of video conferencing services like Zoom. Yet greater use has been accompanied by an uptick in ""Zoombombings,"" as internet provocateurs around the world coordinate to barge into personal conversations to stir chaos.
At physical and online events, CSE staff said they're always on alert for any unwanted guests wishing to protest the organization's pro-LGBTQ messages. Still, the planned interruption of Chong's lesson took the monitors by surprise.
""We didn't have any awareness of it,"" Murray said. ""We have been hosting webinars with open attendance processes in the past and haven't seen anything like this happen.""
Alongside ""Zoombombings"" many anti-Asian incidents have been reported as some accuse China for the virus's evolution into a global pandemic.
In late March, UNC Chapel Hill and Duke University released statements denouncing coronavirus-linked racism against Asians.
Ricky Leung of the advocacy group North Carolina Asian Americans Together said his organization has heard from Asian North Carolinians fearing discrimination. ""We've been getting inquiries about it pretty much since February,"" Leung said. ""People are just kind of concerned.""'
North Carolina is home to one of the fastest growing Asian American populations in the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, no other racial or ethnicity group in the state has grown as quickly since 2010. Asian Americans now make up 3.1% of North Carolina's total population with larger communities in Greensboro, Charlotte, and Raleigh.
In Asheville, Calvin Chu, a self-employed entrepreneur, said his Chinese-American ethnicity still makes him unique. ""I stand out wherever it is that I go in Asheville,"" he said.
In an April 10 Facebook post, Chu described a recent trip to get his oil changed, revealing his thoughts that the cold, uneasy reactions he perceived from the staff may have had something to do with his ethnicity.
""I felt a little bit thrown off and frustrated,"" Chu said.
J Chong believes awareness can help diminish misinformation and fear.
""I think it's very, very important that people know this is happening to Asian Americans right now,"" said Chong, who is also of Chinese descent. ""All the world is suffering right now. We're all going through this together. It's a global pandemic. It's just very unfortunate right now that Asian Americans are being targeted. So, it's very important we talk about it.""
Chong's second cooking tutorial
After the CSE monitors banished the ""Zoombombers"", Chong continued the lesson by fielding culinary questions. The returning audience, she said, was supportive and shocked.
Al Gregory and other CSE staff regrouped over the following days and researched a more rigorous process to weed out intruders on future webinars. For future events, those wishing to attend must have a password, RSVP, and then be placed on a waiting list as CSE staff verify their identifies and intentions. While Gregory said this system should prevent what happened to Chong from happening again, they acknowledge these added steps come at a cost.
""We don't like having those barriers with people and spaces that are intended to be safe and to help foster connection,"" Gregory said.
Immediately following the pesto pasta lesson, CSE asked if Chong would teach another class in the Front Porch series. She didn't hesitate in her response.
""I'm not one to allow stuff like this to stop me,"" said Chong, who had detailed her ""Zoombombing"" experience on Instagram. ""If they asked me to do more, I'll continue doing more.""
On the afternoon of April 10, Chong guided a virtual audience of 12 through a Shrimp pasta recipe with a Caesar salad side. Gregory and their fellow CSE staff watched for any unapproved accounts but none appeared. Chong said it was a perfect way to end the week.

Growing xenophobia amid COVID-19,None,Others,2020-04-12,"Pakistan, April 12 -- Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, another concomitant pandemic named as xenophobia has also enveloped whole the world. As per reported incidents so far, xenophobia, more specifically sinophobia, is surging at an exponential rate across the globe. Stigmatization of Chinese people in wake of outbreak of coronavirus has become new normal in the world. People now look at Chinese with humongous disdain and contempt for they consider them as sole responsible for all the physical and mental afflictions that they are undergoing nowadays due to the COVID-19 which showed its first appearance in Chinese city of Wuhan.
Moreover, this discrimination and antipathy is not only restricted to the Chinese people but people of East Asian and south Asian descent having appearance and facial resemblance with Chinese are also facing xenophobia, prejudice, racial apartheid and violence.
Admittedly, disease inculcates fear in human minds which in turn fosters discrimination. This had been happening in the history whenever there was outbreak of any pandemic. The chronological account of the world shows that during 1853, yellow-fever epidemic in the United States and European immigrants, who were perceived to be more vulnerable to the disease, were primary targets of stigmatization. During the SARS outbreak, which originated in China, East Asian bore the brunt. When the Ebola outbreak emerged in 2014, Africans were targeted. For this reason, the World Health Organization, which is keenly overseeing the global response to the coronavirus outbreak, opted against denoting a geographic location when officially naming the new virus, as it did with Ebola (named after the river in Congo, where it was first detected) and the 2012, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome popularly known as MERS. ""Stigma to be honest is more dangerous than virus itself,"" remarked Dr Tedros Adhanom, the director general of the WHO in his press talk.
However, we find newspapers replete with news pertaining to ballooning xenophobia and racial discrimination in the wake of outbreak of COVID-19. Surprisingly, even the country where from the virus was originated is not immune to this social epidemic of stigmatization. According to the world journal, there have been countless instances of Wuhan natives in other provinces being turned away from hotels, because of their ID numbers, home addresses and telephone numbers deliberately leaked online or dealing with harassing phone calls from strangers. Some places also reportedly had signs saying ""People from Wuhan and cars from Hubei are not welcomed here"".
In addition, on March 29, British daily The Guardian reported that Western and African expatriates in China were reporting enhanced racial hostility and discrimination in response to a shift of COVID-19 cases from local to imported ones. It claims that media in China have published articles entitled as ""Beware of a second outbreak started by foreign garbage"", and incidents of foreigners being barred from restaurants, shops, gyms and hotels, subjected to further screening, and verbal attacks and exclusion are mounting in china day in day out.
Moreover, people of Hong Kong have also started displaying their antipathy for the people of mainland China. The restaurants in Hong Kong are now demanding customers to produce identity card of Hong Kong in order to prove that they are not from mainland. Tenno Ramen, a Japanese noodle restaurant in Hung Hom, refused to serve mainland Chinese customers. The restaurant said on Facebook, ""We want to live longer. We want to safeguard local customers. Please excuse us"".
Indians too are evincing unjustified bias and prejudice towards Chinese people. Indian Islamic cleric Ilyas Sharfuddin said in an audio address that the coronavirus outbreak was a ""punishment of ALLAH on China for mistreating Uighur Muslims"". Ilyas said that ""they (the Chinese) have threatened the Muslims and tried to destroy lives of 20 million Muslims. Muslims were forced to drink alcohol, their mosques were destroyed and their Holy Book was burned. They thought that no one can challenge them, but Allah the most powerful, punished them.""
Apart from this, in Israel, more than 1,000 South Korean tourists were instructed to avoid public places and remain in isolation in their hotels. The Israeli military announced its intention to quarantine some 200 South Korean nationals to a military base. Many of the South Koreans were rejected by hotels and were forced to spend nights at Ben Gaurian Airport. An Israeli newspaper subsequently published a Korean complaint that ""Israel is treating (Korean and other Asian) tourists like coronavirus"".
Sadly, in Japan also, the situation is no more different for Chinese, as the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has been trending on Twitter; furthermore, on Twitter, Japanese people have called Chinese tourists ""dirty"", ""insensitive"", and ""bioterrorists"". According to an Ipsos MORI poll, 28% of Japanese respondents said they would consider avoiding people of Chinese origin in the future to protect themselves from coronavirus.
What's more is that even in Singapore, An online petition urging the Singaporean government to ban Chinese nationals and travellers from China from entering the island country was signed by 125,000 people.
To add, the Ministry of Home Affairs of Singapore has ordered an investigation against an Islamic teacher, Abdul Halim bin Abdul Karim, after he posted on Facebook that the coronavirus pandemic was ""a retribution by Allah against the Chinese for their oppressive treatment of Uighur Muslims in Xinxiang"". In a separate post, Abdul Halim claimed that Chinese people do not wash properly after defecating and were not as hygienic as Muslims, causing the virus to spread. Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam slammed the comments as ""silly"", ""xenophobic"" and ""thoroughly racist"" and is ""quite unacceptable from anyone, let alone someone who is supposed to be a religious teacher"".
Even in England, on February 12, 2020, Sky News reported that some Chinese people in the United Kingdom said they were facing increasing levels of racist abuse; Chinese businesses in the United Kingdom, including the busy Chinese Takeaway segment and businesses in China Town, London recorded significantly reduced customers in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak compared to usual elevated sales related to Chinese New year celebrations, due to fears of coronavirus spreading through food or unhygienic working practices.
Also in America, there have been reports of over 1,000 xenophobia and racism cases against Asian Americans between January 28 and February 24, 2020, which was during the first COVID-19 cases that were reported in the United States. Media critique organization 'FAIR' has documented instances of anti-Asian racism on the street, and states that many US (as well as UK) media outlets capitalize on Sinophobia and ""Orientalist tropes"" that the Chinese are inherently sneaky and untrustworthy, and are ruled by an incompetent, authoritarian government that is the 'sick man of Asia'"".
Moreover, US President Donald Trump's frequent references to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" has been criticized as anti- Chinese and racist, as well as diversionary. Trump continued to use this phrase despite criticism from Democratic legislators as well as Asian American advocates and Public health experts, who said that the use of the phrase inflamed tensions and cited a surge in attacks on Asian Americans. Scott Kennedy, an expert at the center for strategic and international studies, said that Trump's use of the phrase fueled a narrative relating not only to the Chinese Communist Party ""but of China and Chinese people in general"" and was ""xenophobic and tinged with racist overtones,"" especially given the Trump administration's past statements and actions.
To conclude, hope that the world will soon surmount the ongoing pandemic but the pandemic of xenophobia launched particularly against Chinese people and generally against the people of East Asian and South Asian descent, if not inhibited earnestly, would continue to haunt the generations to come and thereby jeopardize the peace of the world.",8214
Reports: Pandemic giving rise to racial discrimination against Asians in Colorado Springs,"Kelley, Debbie",Others,2020-04-19,"Maria, who emigrated from the Philippines to the Pikes Peak region a few years ago and now is a naturalized citizen, hadn’t encountered any discrimination in the United States. Until last month, when the coronavirus pandemic hit.
While shopping in stores, she’s heard comments like, “I’ll buy this even though it’s made in China,” accompanied by a sideways glance her way.
Dirty looks have now become the norm for Maria, a health care worker.
“I feel upset and bad when it happens,” she said, declining to give her last name. “It makes me sad and disappointed.”
In the wake of the coronavirus being detected in Wuhan, China, in December and since spreading worldwide, racial profiling of Asian nationals and Asian-Americans has been reported nationwide. Incidents of Asians being spit on, harassed, yelled at and physically attacked have been documented. Earlier this month, an Asian-American woman taking her trash out in Brooklyn had acid thrown on her, leaving chemical burns.
Since launching on March 19, the Stop Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders Hate reporting center has received more than 1,100 firsthand accounts of coronavirus discrimination, including verbal harassment, shunning and physical assault.
Many of the targets, like Maria, aren’t Chinese but of another descent, such as Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Thai or Cambodian.
Some of the 65 families who are members of the Golden Lotus Foundation, a Colorado Springs nonprofit that promotes Asian heritage and advocates for rights, have been subjected in recent weeks to obscene gestures and racial slurs such as “Go back home!” and “You brought the virus over,” said founder Cynthia Chung Aki.
“Yes, it originated in China, but it is not an Asian issue — it’s everybody’s issue,” she said. “I think we need to settle down and not target minorities, punish anyone or blame anybody for economic, political or geopolitical crises.”
Members are feeling frustrated, uncomfortable and powerless, Aki said, adding that she’s forming a task force to develop appropriate responses to bigotry. Some point to President Donald Trump referring to COVID-19 as the “Chinese virus,” as fomenting racial discord.
Trump did not address the criticism but tweeted on March 23, “It is very important that we totally protect our Asian-American community in the United States, and all around the world.
“They are amazing people, and the spreading of the Virus is not their fault in any way, shape or form. They are working closely with us to get rid of it. We will prevail together!”
Despite that, the president continues to refer to the outbreak as the “Chinese virus,” which Jennifer Ho, professor of ethnic studies at the University of Colorado Boulder and incoming president of the Association for Asian American Studies, said violates an international policy.
“Four years ago, the World Health Organization said we are no longer going to be naming diseases by location or ethnicity because historically we’ve seen the way it marginalizes groups,” Ho said. “There have historically been many traditions we no longer adhere to.”
Anti-Asian sentiment is nothing new, Aki said, pointing to the internment of about 120,000 Japanese-Americans in the U.S. during World War II and the 1982 murder of Chinese-American Vincent Chin, whom autoworkers beat to death in Detroit after mistakenly thinking Chin was Japanese and, therefore, in their minds, responsible for the loss of American auto industry jobs.
“There is a tendency for minorities to be punished,” she said. “It behooves us to be able to tackle this; people are hurting.” Aki hopes generations will come together and work to stop history from repeating itself.
Ho fears incidents of violence will escalate to the point of deaths.
“What would prompt that level of hatred of throwing acid in someone’s face and yell 'Chinese virus?' My guess is fear of the unknown and fear turned into anger,” she said. “People want to find an outlet and a scapegoat.”
Hostility toward Asian-Americans had been reported at the University of Colorado at Boulder in early March, said Ho, who also directs the campus’ Center for Humanities & the Arts.
In one case, a white man left a theater performance shortly after the play started, loudly saying he would not return until the Chinese people left and that they had better put on masks.
“The presumption was they were Chinese, not Asian-Americans, and they were diseased,” Ho said.
Over concerns about unwanted bias, graduate students on the Boulder campus, who were Chinese nationals, decided to self-quarantine before the coronavirus became a pandemic.
“They didn’t want Americans to feel unsafe or insecure,” Ho said. “They were choosing to remain inside rather than going out in public, which is really heartbreaking.”
Colorado College in Colorado Springs also recorded incidents of bias and harassment against Chinese nationals, Chinese-Americans and people of Asian heritage before restrictions closed the campus last month due to stay-at-home orders.
“Many members of our community, including our international students, faculty and staff, may be dealing with stigma. Please uphold our commitment to anti-racism,” read an email sent to students.
“We were seeing xenophobia, mostly disparaging remarks, and overall distasteful behavior,” said Manya Whitaker, associate professor and chair of education. She's also interim director of the Butler Center, the campus' program for diversity, inclusion, intercultural exchange and equity.
“Students on campus were making jokes about them being sick when they were walking by or talking behind students backs or whispering.”
People resort to “lower brain thinking and emotions” when they are overcome by negativity, she said, and tend to rely on stereotypes, huddle with like-minded people and adopt a group mentality.
Many of Colorado College’s 170 Chinese students were anxious because they couldn’t reach their families back home, Whitaker said, and were hurt by the treatment here.
The school contacted two Mandarin-speaking psychologists from Denver to meet with students, she said, and has continued to provide virtual social-emotional support for Asian students.
“It’s disheartening but not surprising,” Whitaker said of the incidents, “particularly when the nation’s president was modeling inappropriate behavior. Adolescents are impressionable, and it’s hard to correct that and convey we should use appropriate language.”
Based on the racial profiling of Muslims after the terrorist attacks on 9/11 — including a Sikh Indian being misidentified as an Arab Muslim and shot outside the gas station he owned in Mesa, Ariz. — Asian-American scholars saw this wave coming as soon as news of the virus spreading started in January, Ho of CU-Boulder said.
“The only question is how bad is it going to get?” she said
Historically, the majority of society believes the actions are an aberration, and while terrible, there’s nothing they can do, Ho said. A minority of the population view profiling as intolerable and unacceptable, she said.
“The trick is as an educator, how do we get the small minority to be the majority,” she said. “I want people to step up and say, ‘This is not OK.’” “When you hear people say racist things, tell them you think what they just said is racist and they shouldn’t say it because it harms people,” Ho said. Educating children on human rights and hate crimes is paramount, Aki said.
The Golden Rule can go a long way, she said.",7448
New York City Has Logged 248 Complaints of Coronavirus Discrimination; Majority of reports were made in March and April; about 42% have been specifically anti-Asian,"Yang, Stephanie",Others,2020-04-19,"Coronavirus-related discrimination in New York City is on the rise, particularly against Asian-Americans, prompting the city to establish a new response team to handle the complaints.
The city's Commission on Human Rights said since Feb. 1 it has received 248 complaints of discrimination spurred by fears over Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus . The majority of complaints were made in March and April, and about 42% have been specifically anti-Asian.
The influx of calls prompted the commission to form a task force in early April to address the incidents, including discrimination in housing or employment based on race, age, immigration status or disability. Several of the calls were from disabled or immunocompromised tenants whose landlords or co-op boards had restricted deliveries of groceries or other purchases.
""The response team came together because we saw that we had so many inquiries coming in after this pandemic started,"" said Sapna Raj, deputy commissioner of the commission's law enforcement bureau. ""We realized we needed to respond rapidly to unique issues that New Yorkers were facing.""
The commission acts as a city watchdog and enforces human-rights laws. It can seek civil penalties against an individual or business accused of discrimination.
Between Feb. 1 and April 16, the commission received 105 reports of anti-Asian incidents, compared with five in the same time frame last year. Out of the discrimination reports, 91 were for harassment, five were for housing and nine were for public accommodation.
Hate crimes against Asian-Americans have risen this year as well, while the number of overall crimes in New York City has fallen. Between March 7 and April 2, the New York Police Department has received reports of 11 hate crimes related to the disease and made seven arrests.
Following an inquiry, the human-rights commission may advise on a caller's rights and intervene, or open up a longer-term investigation. If the commission determines the complaint to be a hate crime, the case is passed along to the NYPD Hate Crime Task Force.
As the original coronavirus outbreak in China morphed into a global pandemic , Chinese-Americans and others of Asian descent have reported more cases of racism and discrimination. However, broader data on the discrimination is sparse.
Manjusha P. Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, said members of Asian communities may be reluctant to report incidents because of immigration and policing concerns.
She said the organization was alerted to its first coronavirus-related discrimination issue in early February, after a middle-school child in Los Angeles was accused by another student of having the disease. An online form for reporting similar cases that launched on March 19 has garnered about 1,500 responses across 46 states, most notably in California and New York, ranging from refusal of service to physical attacks.
""Even though the numbers are small overall, I think it's an indication of what we're seeing across the country,"" Ms. Kulkarni said. ""All those efforts are important to get a better understanding of the problem.""
Wayne Ho, president of the Chinese-American Planning Council, a nonprofit that provides social services to Asian-Americans, said he started noticing the fallout as early as January, in the form of snide remarks and the avoidance of Chinese businesses.
Mr. Ho said new policies and enforcement of legislation can help protect against discrimination in housing and jobs, but an increase in harassment requires more social outreach.
""I have staff members who have been spit on by people, people have yelled at them or made comments on the subway,"" he said. ""People have thrown everything from pieces of paper to their leftover lunch.""",3801
China: Chinese Americans Battle Racism as COVID-19 Spreads,None,Others,2020-04-09,"Lu Ping does battle for her adopted country armed with a smartphone.
Every day from 6 a.m. to midnight, Lu coordinates donations of masks, medical supplies and money to Chinese Americans Support Hospitals (CASH), a GoFundMe group she started with friends in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.
The group's mission is to get needed supplies for hospitals in the Washington, D.C., metro area, which includes portions of Maryland and Virginia, and is known by residents as the DMV.
""This is my home,"" Lu said about why she spends hours on WeChat, the Chinese version of WhatsApp, soliciting donations. ""I must help.""
Her group is not alone. Chinese Americans throughout the United States are mobilizing to provide supplies and equipment to front-line medical professionals, even as the FBI warns of the likelihood of an increase in hate crimes targeting Asian Americans as the pandemic continues.
""The community itself, just in general, is organized,"" Mai Ngai, a professor of Asian American studies and history at Columbia University, told The New York Times recently. ""Chinese have all kinds of associations - some based on profession, and some based on the region your family comes from in China,"" she said. ""There's a history of networks, and a history of coming together when there's an issue.""
A graduate of China's Zhejiang University medical school, Lu emigrated from Shanghai to the United States in 1998. The stay-at-home mom represents many, if not most, of the Chinese Americans who have built lives in new places that have not always been welcoming.
""We cannot be completely separated from China,"" said Wei Wu, minister of the Chinese Christian Church of Germantown, Maryland, who co-founded CASH. ""Whatever happens in China reflects on us, even if this is our home. That's why right now, we feel targeted and insecure because there are people here who are not happy with China.""
Critics say President Donald Trumpheightened this tension by calling COVID-19 the ""Chinese virus"" last month.

Since COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, China, late last year, it has swept through 209 countries, sickening 1.3 million people, and killing 75,000 as of Tuesday. There are more than 368,000 confirmed cases and 10,000 deaths in the United States.
Two California-based groups, Chinese for Affirmative Action and theAsian Pacific Planning and Policy Council, set up a hate crime reporting center in March and have recorded hundreds of incidents.
New York Attorney General Letitia James also launched a hotline to cope with an increase in reports ofharassment and assaults, as well as the use of slurs against all Asian Americans during the coronavirus outbreak.
Which is why Ryan Lin bought not one gun but two.
""My wife has been against me having a gun, but this time, she made no objection,"" said Lin, a resident of the same leafy Maryland suburbs as Lu and Wei. Afraid for his family, Lin asked VOA not to use his real name.
Lu created CASH as a WeChat group on March 17, and within days some 400 people joined. WeChatis heavily censored by China's Communist Party and used regularly as a platform for itspropaganda. But for those with family and friends in China, it is the preferred social media platform for staying in touch.
Many CASH members were part of an informal group started a week earlier byLiang Zhao, a native of Hebei province, who arrived in the U.S. in 1998.With a life science background, he and friends who are medical and pharmaceutical professionals anticipated a shortage of protective gear in the U.S. as they watched the epidemic take hold in China.
""We were worried about the health workers on the front lines, and we wanted to do something to show that we Chinese Americans care about our community,"" Zhao told VOA Mandarin. ""It's our own home.""
As of March 31, the two groups, working with another grassroots Chinese American group, have raised about $100,000. Zhao said with that money, they reached out to medical suppliers approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in China and the United States.
The first shipment from China - 112,000 surgical masks, 3,000 N95 masks, more than 1,000 gowns and 360 face shields - was delivered to 12 local hospitals on Friday.
Yaya Zhang, a native of Jiangsu province who arrived in the U.S. in 2004, isa real estate agent and a CASH co-founder responsible for acquiring masks. She believes she and other members are making a meaningful contribution. CASH has collected 650 surgical masks - 20 N95 and about 900 Chinese-approved KN95.
'We are American'
Lu is also president of the Alumni Association of Zhejiang University in the Washington, D.C., area, which has partnered with the Chinese Alumni Associations of Greater Washington to express alarm about the rising xenophobia.
""We are American,"" the groups proclaim. ""Guard our homeland and fight the epidemic."" But that sentiment has not protected them from racial attacks.
The Committee of 100 (C100), a nonpartisan organization of prominent Chinese Americans, issued a statement March 25 condemning ""racially charged slurs, actions, and violence against the Chinese American and Asian American community.""
Lin, of Maryland, told VOA Mandarin that two men verbally attacked his younger sister a few days ago for wearing a face mask while she shopped at a Costco in Baltimore.
""They told her to go back to China and shouted at her that she shouldn't come out to infect others when she was sick,"" he said.
Lin said his sister's experience is what prompted him to buy the guns, despite Trump's call to ""protect our Asian American community."" After living in the U.S. for 32 years, Lin said he is no longer sure of where he belongs.
""I have always regarded the United States as my own country, and now, I don't know which country I am (in),"" he said. - VOA",6354
Asian celebs work to combat racist attacks amid pandemic,None,Others,2020-04-27,"Actress Olivia Cheng was recently volunteering in Vancouver when she says she witnessed a man drive up to an elderly Chinese woman, roll down his window and yell, ""This is your fault!"" before throwing trash at her.
The incident enraged Cheng, and also served as another reason why she feels it's so important for celebrities of Asian descent to use their voices and speak up against anti- Asian attacks, which authorities say are increasing during the coronavirus pandemic.
""I don't think we can pretend that this isn't happening,"" Cheng, who stars in ""The Stand"" on CBS All Access, said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. ""For now, it would not be unwise to be a little more careful, to maybe have buddy systems when possible to go get your groceries if you're not feeling safe.""
The FBI reports there has been an uptick in hate crimes and harassment against Asian Americans since the outbreak of COVID-19, which first appeared in Wuhan, China, late last year.
Some people have blamed China and Asians in general for the spread of coronavirus; President Donald Trump at times has called it the ""Chinese virus.""
In New York, state Attorney General Letitia James has set up a hotline to report harassment or other targeted crime. Some of those incidents have been filmed and posted online.
""Tigertail"" star Tzi Ma says he's been a victim of such harassment. He was entering a grocery store in Pasadena, California, recently when he was confronted by a man in a car.
""He looked at me straight in the eye and said, 'You should be quarantined' and took off,"" said the veteran actor, who was born in Hong Kong but moved to the United States as a child.
""I got very angry obviously, flush with this kind of cold in your body. And I started screaming at him, but he was way too far away for him to hear me.""
VIDEO: Chinese Canadians warn against a repeat of the racism they faced during SARS
Actor Alain Uy, a star of the upcoming Hulu series ""Marvel's Helstrom,"" worried early on that such incidents would occur after the virus' spread.
""Once this outbreak happened in Wuhan, we all kind of went, 'OK, we know what this is gonna mean,'"" said the actor, who was born in the Philippines.
""Crazy Rich Asians"" director Jon M. Chu said he's been feeling more cautious than usual.
""It's very sad when I feel a little bit weird when I'm going to go for a walk around the block,"" he said,
""The Real"" co-host, Jeannie Mai, who is half-Vietnamese and half-Chinese, revealed recently that for the first time, she needed someone to monitor her social media posts to delete racist comments.
""The Good Doctor"" actor Will Yun Lee is even nervous about taking his baby son to the grocery store: ""My wife is Caucasian, but my son is half Korean and half white. But he looks very Asian.""
But Ma and other stars are speaking up and working to combat the ignorance and harassment. Ma joined actress Celia Au and other celebrities and influencers in the recent campaign called "" Wash the Hate, "" created by IW Group, an Asian American-focused marketing agency. The PSA features Ma, Au and others washing their hands and reminding people that hygiene, not xenophobia, is the way to help combat the virus.
""If I can start the conversation, why not?' said Au, who was also born in Hong Kong. ""If we don't talk about it, then it's not going to be talked about at all.""
For Cheng, the recent wave of anti-Asian sentiment brought back painful memories of her childhood growing up in Edmonton, Canada, where she was the victim of a bias attack as a teen.
She went down an internet rabbit hole of attacks posted online. ""I had to stop watching,"" she said. ""It brought up all those feelings again from being a kid and not being able to do anything.""
    Mai says that it's not only important for Asian stars to speak out against these attacks, but people of other races as well.
""These are the conversations you need to be having with your kids in your house. You need to, even if you're not Chinese. You should be explaining that this is terrible, that racism is coming out of this pandemic,"" she said. ""So, have that talk with your kid. Have that talk with your friends. If one of your friends says, 'Yo, this 'Chinese Virus' is crazy.' Say, 'No. Actually, man it's called COVID-19. It's not the 'Chinese Virus.'' Just check them.""

Earlier this month, ""The Real"" host Bill Maher defended calling coronavirus the ""Chinese Virus,"" comparing it to the Spanish flu.
""While people say it's innocuous and that it came from China, it's the undertones,"" Lee said. ""Certain people will grab those undertones and attach to it."" There's also a worry that anti-Asian American sentiment could translate to a regression in Hollywood after recent success of telling Asian stories.
This year, the South Korean film ""Parasite"" won the best picture Oscar, and Chinese-American director Lulu Wang took home the Independent Spirit Award for her film, ""The Farewell."" ""Crazy Rich Asians"" was a hit at the box office in 2018 and last year, Sandra Oh became the first Asian woman in 39 years to win the best leading TV actress Golden Globe for ""Killing Eve.""
""I worry, is this going to impact our chances so soon after it feels like we finally made inroads?"" Cheng said. ""Is this going to regress us and put us however many steps back?"" Ma says the only way to proceed is to keep putting out diverse stories.
""There's no relenting. We'll keep moving forward. And hopefully one day, people are going to say, 'You know what? I not only accept the differences, but I also accept the fact that we're very much alike.'""",5647
ASIAN AMERICAN HARASSMENT: Atlanta PD unit looks into defamatory signs posted around city: Official says plaques may not meet criteria of bias-motivated crime.,"Habersham, Raisa",Others,2020-04-23,"Hodgepodge Coffeehouse owner Kristle Rodriguez received a text from her employee about the sign: a round plaque glued to the Moreland Avenue building that's home to her restaurant depicting Winnie the Pooh eating a bat with chopsticks below the words ""Wuhan Plague.""
The signs have been popping up around East Atlanta on a variety of buildings and fixtures. Atlanta Police Department's Homeland Security Unit, which investigates bias- motivated crimes, has been notified about the signs but so far no arrests have been made.
""It's doing nothing but reinforcing really awful stereotypes,"" said Rodriguez, who posted a photo of the sign on her social media page to mixed reactions. ""I have Asian American friends that said it's allergy season and they're afraid to sneeze in public because of all of the hate speech.""
Asian Americans have reported increased harassment around the globe since the coronavirus outbreak originated in Wuhan, China. Asians make up 4% of Atlanta's population, according to U.S. Census data.
For the past week, Atlanta police have received calls about the signs, which appear to be small, bronze-colored plaques that are glued in place. According to three police reports, the first was seen April 13 on an electrical box in front of 188 Waverly Way in Inman Park. Another was found on April 16 on a city lamp post near the intersection of Wylie and Flat Shoals in Reynoldstown. A third was found on the Candler Park Market on April 18.
Owners for One Moreland, the building where Hodgepodge is located, turned in a video of the sign to Atlanta police.
Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said the department's Homeland Security Unit has been notified about the plaques, but added they don't appear to meet the criteria for a bias crime.
""Ifsomeoneweretobeidentified as placing them, any charges would have to be looked at on a case-by-case basis, depending largely on whether any damage was done to the property to which the medallion is being affixed,""Campos said.
For the plaques to be considered a bias crime, there must be evidence the crime was committed based on the victim's race, religion or sex, or another identifier. Because Georgia doesn't have a hate crime statute, police would have to confer with the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office before they could prosecute the case under federal hate crime laws.
Animator and muralist Rod Ben, 35, of Tucker, said the plaques' overt Asian metaphors invite people to place blame for the coronavirus on those from Asian countries and Asian American residents.
""No one feels safe,"" said Ben, who is Cambodian and Vietnamese. ""I'm worried for my parents going to the grocery store. Even older people are being harassed and attacked, and if you're not going to leave old people alone, where is (the harassment) going to stop?""

Naperville trail attack on Chinese-American man leaves many,None,Others,2020-04-19,"A March 21 attack on a Chinese American man jogging along a Naperville trail has left the Asian community there uneasy, says resident Nancy Chen.
The women spit on and threw sticks at the man and told him ""to go back to China,"" Chen said.
""It just does not reflect the kind of Naperville that I have been calling home for almost now 50 years,"" she said.
A Naperville Crime Stoppers poster shows two unidentified women who are wanted for questioning and offers a $1,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. Naperville police are investigating.
Chen, an advisory board member of United Chinese Americans Illinois Chapter, is urging the Naperville City Council to adopt a resolution condemning racism and supporting Asian Americans.
Viral racism: Since March 19, the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council’s STOP AAPI HATE reporting center has received more than 1,100 reports nationwide of coronavirus-related discrimination against Asian Americans.
A majority of incidents occurred in grocery stores, pharmacies and big box retail stores, the center reports.
Chen said there’s been a rise in anti-Asian sentiment and hate crimes in the wake of President Donald Trump and other politicians labeling COVID-19 a ""Chinese virus.""

E-learning access gaps: Suburban educators are realizing gaps in student access to e-learning due to technological challenges affecting low- income and minority families.
At Elgin Area School District U-46, officials are seeing a significant drop in participation among Hispanic and African American students. Attendance rates post-COVID-19 lockdown declined during the first week of distance learning — from 95% to 90% among Asians, from 94% to 89% among whites, from 92% to 76% among Hispanics, and from 90% to 66% among blacks.

COVID-19 support helpline: A coalition of religious, civic and social service organizations from the greater Chicago area has formed a task force to coordinate COVID-19 support services. It includes free tele-health consultations, access to medical, mental health and dental care, food distribution, emergency monetary assistance, and help filing for unemployment benefits. To access services, call the helpline, (847) 737-1785, staffed by professionals and volunteers.
The task force comprises members of Council of Islamic Organizations of Greater Chicago, local and national relief agencies, associations of medical and dental professionals and community service groups.
More black docs: Being comfortable with one’s doctor is key to dealing with any health crisis. For blacks, it’s harder to build that trust when most doctors don’t look like them, and that can be an issue in the suburbs, experts say.

Aurora event to inspire young Latinas goes global,"Krishnamurthy, Madhu",Others,2020-04-26,"With public gatherings banned, an Aurora event aimed at inspiring young Latinas earlier this month went virtual — drawing its largest audience in four years.
Aurora’s annual Young Latina Day attracted 30,000 people and garnered nearly 13,000 Facebook views in six hours from 13 countries. Fifty Latina speakers shared their stories to help empower the next generation of Hispanic girls and women and celebrate their achievements.
""It was historic,"" said Jacqueline Camacho-Ruiz of North Aurora, creator of the nonprofit Fig Factor Foundation, which launched the event in 2017. ""We are trying to make this day recognized globally by the United Nations in 2021. It’s a big aspirational goal.""

With students spending more time online, Yang is concerned about such harassment shifting to those platforms. District 203 teachers have been emphasizing ""how to be a good online citizen"" as part of the social-emotional learning curriculum, she added.
Naperville has a high Asian American population — 18 percent — including people of Chinese and Korean descent and from other East Asian countries.
""This is a good chance to reflect on what true diversity and inclusion means ... to have our students truly understand what it means to have someone who looks different and have that sense of empathy for them,"" Yang said.
Naperville race relations Naperville city leaders could create a commission to improve race relations after reports of recent racist attacks against Asian Americans.
Resident Nancy Chen introduced a resolution before the council Wednesday urging leaders to establish such a commission. It was motivated by the reported March 21 attack of a 60-year-old Chinese American man jogging on a Naperville trail and offensive remarks made by a speaker during the April 7 virtual council meeting.
Bill Liu, chairman of Chinese community outreach appointed by the late Mayor George Pradel, also asked the council to denounce actions that unfairly stereotype and single out Asian Americans. ""Derogatory and insulting comments should not be part of the public discourse,"" Liu said.
City Manager Doug Krieger said officials plan to roll out a broader diversity and inclusion plan in the works since two high-profile incidents last fall — a multiracial group of 18 was asked to move at Buffalo Wild Wings because two white customers did not want to sit nearby and a 14-year-old white student posted an ad online showing a photo of a black classmate with the words ""Slave for Sale (NAPERVILLE).""
""We want this to be broader than simply just a proclamation,"" Krieger said.
He expects to present the plan before the city council in May.
Ramadan food baskets While suburban mosques are closed, many are finding ways to help community members in need during the COVID-19 lockdown.
The Mecca Center in Willowbrook will be cooking food in its communal kitchen for pickup twice weekly during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which began Friday. For information about pickup times visit meccacenter.org.
  The center’s Faith in Action initiative also will be delivering food baskets during Ramadan to community members irrespective of faith, said Imam Hassan Aly.
""Our goal is to distribute 2,000 food baskets to our neighbors,"" said Aly, a Hinsdale Community Service board member.
Aly is inviting clients of the food pantry at nearby Anne Jeans Elementary School to drop by the center on Sundays for food pickup. ""We will continue to do that for the month of Ramadan and maybe even after as long as there is need,"" Aly said.",4360
'Immediately I started to worry': UM forum discusses racism in the age of COVID-19,"Reilly, Patrick",Others,2020-04-24,"When an Asian-American University of Montana faculty member heard that President Trump had called COVID-19 the “Chinese virus,” her heart sank.
“Immediately I started to worry how some people will take this message and blame Chinese Americans for all the virus,” she wrote. As anti-Asian racism spread with the pandemic, her concern grew. “With fear, I have put extra effort to minimize my Asian look. When my family and I are in public spaces ... we wear hats and hoods and minimize talking in our native language.”
This person’s name was not shared with participants in a UM online forum Friday afternoon. But another UM faculty member, Nicky Phear, read the woman's account to illustrate the hurdles that Missoulians of Asian descent now face.
“Weeks before Montanans started the stay-at-home status,” she continued, “my family and lots of my Chinese friends had already decided to stay at home as much as possible, because we fear the virus spread, and we fear the potential harm by other people based on our identities.”
Since the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, researchers and advocacy groups have reported a surge in harassment and hate crimes against Asian-Americans. The University of Montana's Maureen and Mike Mansfield Center brought Missoulians together via the Zoom videoconferencing app to discuss the topic.
This rise in racism has reached Missoula, the anecdotes Phear shared made clear. Two other panelists, activist and writer Helen Zia and UM History Professor Tobin Miller Shearer, described how these latest incidents fit a long pattern of American racism against Asians, one that also included the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, mass internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, and hate crimes against Asian-Americans in the 1980s, when Japan was widely blamed for the collapse of the U.S. auto industry.
Miller Shearer, director of UM's African-American Studies program, gave several suggestions for how Missoulians can help fight this latest trend — and called on white residents to get involved. “Over the years, I’ve found that members of the white community found the process of interrupting racism very challenging,” he said, but “for those of us who are white, this is some of the most important work that we have to do.”
Miller Shearer encouraged participants to educate themselves on how to respond to racism they encounter, and to ask Montana’s congressional delegation to support federal efforts to counter anti-Asian racism.
As racism against Asian-Americans has risen in the United States, foreigners have faced discrimination in China. “I have absolutely no doubt that the vast majority of Chinese are just like us ... basically kind and people who want to do the right thing,” said panelist Terry Weidner, retired professor of Chinese politics. “Like us, though, they are also flawed, and thus love a good conspiracy theory and give in to the temptation, especially in a time of fear and uncertainty, to blame others.”
He faulted both President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping for stoking that inclination. “Both have giant egos, intolerance of any criticism, and a tendency to deflect blame by shifting it onto others.”
Zia concurred. “I think what we are seeing worldwide, is that governments, communities, systems. are completely under stress and it is a pretty standard standard political move for political leaders anywhere to try to deflect blame.”
But even if it’s standard, she continued, that doesn’t make it right.
“if our leaders are too busy blaming other people, where’s the attention going on to bring people together to actually solve our common problems?”",3627
UW ADDRESSES RACIST GRAFFITI ; VIRTUAL TOWN HALL ATTRACTS 400 VIEWERS; CHINESE FACULTY CALL FOR ACTION ; EDUCATION,"Kim, Yvonne",Others,2020-04-01,"Over 400 people tuned into a virtual town hall via Zoom last Thursday to hear University of Wisconsin-Madison administrators discuss responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, most notably a recent rise in hate and racist incidents.
The university has seen 81 bias incident reports this semester, 47 of which have involved Asian or international students, said Jenna Friedman, assistant director of bias response at the Dean of Students Office. Twenty-five reports came in response to two anti-Chinese messages written in chalk, one outside the Walgreens on State and Lake Streets and another near the Humanities Building.
In a letter to Chancellor Rebecca Blank's office, a group of Chinese faculty members asked the university to investigate and condemn the incidents and said the university is ""faced with a grave challenge to our daily life, while carrying on our academic duties to the best of our abilities in such trying times."" It was signed by over 1,000 people.
""COVID-19 has affected all of us personally, academically and professionally, as well as physically, mentally, and socially,"" Blank said in a statement last week. ""Even so, it's important to remember: No one person, country, or ethnicity created this pandemic - disease does not discriminate.""
Friedman said that the graffiti has been removed and the university is working with city police to find video footage.
Town hall participants submitted text questions to panelists from the Multicultural Student Center, International Student Services and the Division of Diversity, Equity and Educational Achievement. Panelists said recent incidents have involved people coughing on individuals wearing masks or gloves, increasing stigma about wearing protective equipment in public, which Dean of Students Christina Olstad called ""disgusting"" and ""unacceptable.""
The graffiti is no isolated incident. Despite much earlier calls from groups from the World Health Organization and the Asian American Association of Journalists to describe COVID-19 with scientific and neutral language, analyses show increased racist rhetoric online. Earlier in March, the term ""Chinese virus,"" which was used in the graffiti, was widely circulated online after a tweet using the term was posted by President Donald Trump.
A new online reporting forum, Stop AAPI Hate, received over 650 direct reports in just one week, according to NBC Asian America.
One of the faculty who drafted the letter, who asked to remain anonymous, said Asian faculty have experienced cases of discrimination over their past decade at UW-Madison, amid a largely welcoming environment. The recent pandemic, however, has ""triggered and fanned this racial hatred and intolerance, and made it more publicly visible,"" the Chinese faculty members said.
When asked how students could better organize against racism and bias, professor Cindy I-fen Cheng advised students to fight isolation from a place of connection and community.
""There's places for hurt and anger ... but how do we bring out the best values, the kind of world that we would like to live in?"" said Cheng, director of the Asian American Studies Program. ""Remember your student groups, remember who your safety people are and, when you feel hurt, go to them.""
Chinese faculty and students have generally found support from their peers this week, the faculty member said. Immediately following the incident, they found themselves crying and shaking for a couple of hours, though ""great families and supportive colleagues"" calmed them down.
Samantha McCabe, interim director of International Student Services, extended a message of encouragement to international students, whom she said make up about 15% of UW-Madison's student population.
""You are not voiceless in this,"" McCabe said.",3760
Xenophobia ‘takes its toll’ as Trump works to curb immigration,None,Others,2020-04-22,"Immigration to the US often suffers when the country faces a disaster, whether it is a disaster of war, economy or public health.
The novel coronavirus pandemic has already prompted the Trump administration to close borders and turn away asylum-seekers without sufficient processing. On Monday, President Donald Trump tweeted that he would suspend immigration to the US.
That statement was later clarified as a plan to temporarily halt giving foreigners permanent residence in the United States, which Trump claims will protect American workers during the coronavirus pandemic. The order, which is undergoing a legal review, would suspended the process to grant foreigners ""green cards"" for permanent residence, but a White House official who requested anonymity to discuss the process suggested the timeline for the order could be pushed back.
Critics say the president's announcement is a move to take advantage of the coronavirus crisis to implement a long-sought policy goal ahead of this year's presidential election. Business groups expressed opposition to Trump's plan on Tuesday, arguing it would only further depress the economy.
Many key details of Trump's planned executive order are still unknown, but crucially, while the order could block many people applying for permanent residence outside the United States, it is not clear how it would impact people already in the country seeking to become permanent residents. Trump said the order initially would last for 60 days and could be renewed for the same period or longer, and that a second immigration-focused order was under consideration.
The Washington-based Migration Policy Institute estimates that Trump's green card effort could prevent between 114,000 and 660,000 people securing permanent residence - if left in place for a year.
Erika Lee is an immigration history professor at the University of Minnesota and the author of ""America for Americans: A History of Xenophobia in the United States."" The World's Marco Werman spoke with Lee about how the US has responded with changes to immigration policy and increased xenophobia during times of war, economic hardship and disease throughout history.
Related: For centuries, migrants have been said to pose public health risks. They don't.
Marco Werman: Let's take a historical look at this. Your book, ""America for Americans"" is about the US' long history with xenophobia. You've seen the intersection of disease or other crises and nativism before in the past century. How does this current administration's response to this pandemic compare to another public health emergency, whether it's the 1918 flu or the response to the collapse of hygiene in New Orleans after Katrina?
Erika Lee: The 1918 flu pandemic is actually really fascinating to compare it to what's happening today. So first, we have to understand that, of course, during World War I, immigration was effectively halted due to the war and the end of passenger steamship travel. But even during the flu pandemic, in which the US lost 650,000 lives, the country didn't try to limit immigration. In fact, we still let in over 110,000 immigrants. And the Bureau of Immigration touted its kind treatment of sick immigrants.
So, take the immigration detention center in New Orleans, for example. There was an outbreak of flu epidemic there. There were 30 immigrants who were sick. But the Bureau of Immigration published a report in which it touted how it took care of its employees by requiring face masks, it sanitized the facilities, it put into place social distancing or isolation. And because of that treatment of immigrants, no lives were lost.
Related: Public charge rule has history of 'racial exclusion'
Erika, the stories right now of hate directed at Asians, Asian Americans - we're hearing stories of acid attacks. So personally, what has it's been like for you as
someone whose grandfather arrived in this country during the Chinese Exclusion Act?
You know, I remember hearing stories of my parents insisting that during World War II, into the 1950s and '60s, they still felt the sting, not only of Chinese exclusion, but also just anti-Asian racism, in general. Obviously, Japanese American incarceration, as well. And their philosophy was, ""We need to show that we're Americans first and Chinese second."" So for them, there was this sense of sort of ultra assimilation. ""We need to prove that we're loyal. We need to prove that we're patriots. We need to prove that we're assimilated.""
I think that the sense of worthiness, you know, is really being questioned for Chinese Americans and other Asian Americans, feeling like they're being suspected of bringing the virus and spreading the virus. And it takes its toll. And it's not just these horrific violent attacks, these physical attacks or the name calling or the social shunning. It's also just this internalized sense of, ""Oh, I thought we belonged. But look how easily the tables can be turned on us."" And I think there's a palpable sense of fear now that we're all supposed to wear masks out in public. There is a racialized image of an Asian person in a mask that is quite different than any other type of person wearing a medical mask.",5192
Korean-American: My neighbors scare me more than COVID-19,None,Others,2020-04-24,"I'm an American. I'm Korean. I'm your neighbor. I've grown up here just like you have, so why is it that people still stare at me like I'm an infected carrier?
What do the coronavirus and most Americans have in common? Neither one can tell the difference between Korean and Chinese people. To the virus, everyone looks the same. To the average American we Asians ""all look the same,"" too. Why does it matter? Because, like contracting the coronavirus, simply looking Chinese can get me hurt or killed.
I am an Asian-American teenager living in Palisades Park, New Jersey. I do not cough on vegetables. I do not eat bats or Pangolins. I did not go to Florida to party on the beach during Spring Break. I maintain the proper social distance and isolate myself as required. But, I also eat fast food like my peers. I love to run. I like playing League of Legends and the typical stuff any American teenager loves. You can't tell all that just by looking at me – especially if you're silently blaming me for the virus outbreak because you think I'm Chinese.
Yes, China is responsible. But does that mean that all Chinese people are inherently bad, and that all of them are individually responsible for the actions of people who share the same race as them? No.
That's just like saying that all Americans are murderers just because an American committed a murder. There is no reason for people to see all Asians as virus-carriers, and yet, they do.
I'm an American. I'm Korean. I'm your neighbor. I've grown up here just like you have, so why is it that people still stare at me like I'm an infected carrier?
There are millions of Asian-Americans, some of whom have never been to China, or even Korea or out of the United States, who are buying guns and sheltering in place and self-isolating. It's not because we fear the COVID-19 virus, but because we fear our neighbors. It's like World War II Japanese internment camps where Japanese Americans were forced into concentration camps in America after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. More than 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry, including entire families, most of whom lived on the Pacific Coast of America, went from being community members to community outcasts. Why? Because of their race – something they couldn't change. Those of us who remember those times, or have relatives who do, are worried.
Now, with the simple declaration that the current shut-downs of bars, small businesses, theatres, gyms and public venues like campgrounds and parks are ""for the good of the health of the country,"" we wonder, will governors and the president think internment camps are a good idea too?
Don't say, ""Oh, of course not. That's not reasonable or logical.""
Is it reasonable or logical for people to hoard toilet paper and hand sanitizer? It's perception, not reality, that drives people to act the way they do when they're terrified and in fear for their lives.
The media has covered Asians buying guns – making us look even more threatening. But what about how we're being affected? What we're experiencing? What we fear? Asians are buying firearms in order to protect themselves from the very possible attacks of racists, and from ordinary people who are scared and uninformed. The media does not cover nearly enough of the assaults, harassment and abuse towards Asians. I see more about this racism on social media than I do on the actual news, which goes to show how lacking the media is in the coverage of Asians. Why do Asians today have to tolerate the inexcusable hate crimes done against us? It just seems like the fear we contain inside ourselves is unknown to other non-Asians. In order for people to acknowledge and understand our pain and fear, the media needs to do its part and spread awareness about Asians as well as this virus.
So, before staring at and avoiding us Asians, please take into account our feelings; our emotions. Think about the pain we are going through, and how scared we all are to even step foot outside of our houses. The world would be a much better place if we just stayed calm and rational and tried to understand one another.

Asian Americans worry of xenophobia,"Soellner, Mica",Others,2020-04-12,"APPLETON - Growing up in an urban area, Christa Zhang never felt wary about being Asian American.
The native St. Louisan moved to Appleton to attend Lawrence University, which she said welcomed her with open arms. She's never felt unsafe in the community despite moving into a far less diverse area than her home city.
It wasn't until the coronavirus outbreak trickled into the local community that she started to feel uneasy about her race.
Remarks by President Donald Trump, public officials and media pundits who made it a point to tie the virus to its origin of Wuhan, China sent Zhang and other Asian Americans into uncertainty about how they might be perceived as a result of the blame.
As reports of racist incidents, attacks and assaults started coming to light across the country in cities like New York and Los Angeles, fear started circulating even further.
And, if xenophobic incidents are occurring in large metro areas coast to coast, Zhang only fears her being more conspicuous in a smaller city like Appleton may make her a stronger target for any public discomfort.
""It is a predominantly white area,"" Zhang said.
Zhang said when she has to go out in public, she has a heightened sense of her identity as an Asian American.
""I am afraid that if I appear sick or if I cough in public people around me will have that in the back of their head and it makes me more cautious of every move that I make,"" Zhang said.
The coronavirus pandemic has sent the country and world into a spiral of business closures, social distancing and isolation. The outbreak of the virus began in Wuhan, but how it was started is shrouded in mystery and rumors.
Despite the inconclusive epicenter of the virus, some public officials and pundits have emphasized blame on the Chinese government for the spread of the virus, targeting the communist regime as well as the cultural practices of Chinese residents like going to wet markets.
Trump has repeatedly referred to the virus as the ""Chinese virus"" in a battle of blame between the U.S. and China.
Chinese officials and propaganda outlets have used disinformation tactics to pass the buck on the virus by spreading a conspiracy theory that the U.S. military had planted the virus in Wuhan, which also heightened pushback from lawmakers to place blame on China.
Claire Zhuang said she feels like even if the connotation is meant to blame the Chinese government, it can unintentionally spread xenophobic feelings.
""I think (Trump) is trying to put the blame on the Chinese government, but what it does is enable anti-Asian sentiment to come forth in the U.S.,"" Zhuang said. ""I think it sometimes also detracts from what's really important right now because we're in the middle of a crisis and for me, I don't think the origins are really important.""
Since controversy has grown, Trump has taken a different tune agreeing to halt the use of ""Chinese virus"" to de-escalate tensions between the U.S. and China and suggested he made it into a bigger deal than needed.
On March 23, Trump tweeted: ""It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States and all around the world. They are amazing and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape or form. They are working closely with us to get rid of it. We will prevail together!""
Law enforcement officials in Wisconsin have cited an uptick of racially motivated incidents and state officials have spoken out against any acts.
Last week, the University of Wisconsin-Madison condemned chalk messages that were written on a campus sidewalk blaming the virus on China. University leaders took to a virtual town hall to discuss the increasingly hostile climate towards Asian Americans on campus.
Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul also sent out a statement warning against any racist or xenophobic acts toward Asian Americans living in Wisconsin. ""We must stand together and speak out against racism and xenophobia,"" Kaul said.",3971
Covid-19 and racism: a deadly cocktail for NE people,None,Others,2020-04-02,"Guwahati, April 2 -- The Covid-19 is set to dominate the future debates on globalization, but its impact is not merely limited to the field of health or international relations. Donald Trump, the President of the United States, called the Covid-19 as the 'Chinese virus' or 'China virus' on multiple occasions. In his defence, he had pointed out that the term was not racist at all as the virus was said to have originated in that country. However, he changed his position and tweeted that the spread of the novel coronavirus in the US was not the fault of the Asian-Americans. Partly responsible for this change of heart may be the fact that the Asian-Americans have been a target of growing number of racist and xenophobic attacks related with the virus.
However, closer home, disturbing facts related to an 'old virus' but having mutated to a new form are doing the rounds in many parts of India now. This pertains to a spike in racist taunts/attacks against the northeasterners with reference to the novel coronavirus. One would like to call it Racism-19 for the sake of brevity.
There are instances galore of this latest trend which is raising its ugly head. The most infamous being how a Manipuri girl was spat on and called 'corona' while she stepped out to pick up essentials in North Delhi. Fortunately in this case, the police acted promptly and arrested the culprit.
In Kolkata, 'Go corona go' chants could be heard in a particular locality. No, this wasn't any community confidence building exercise to tide over the dark clouds hanging over all of us due to the pandemic, but a mob that had gathered outside the flat where three women from Nagaland resided. The crowd was adamant that the women ' so- called 'carriers of the virus' ' should immediately leave their house as well as the locality. When the incidents like these occur, it is difficult to understand whether the crowd was driven by genuine fear of Covid-19 or outright racism. As the videos doing the rounds on social media show, the crowd was not maintaining any social distancing, and hence the possibility of the former appears low.
In another harrowing tale, the members of a housing society in Ahmedabad harassed some students from the Northeast and pressurized them to vacate the house and move out. Fortunately, the cops intervened but imagine the mental agony of having to live with such neighbours who would do anything to push you out. What is difficult to understand is that the students neither had any foreign travel history nor had shown any symptoms of the virus.
Another video which is going viral on the micro blogging site Twitter is of some people from Nagaland not being allowed to buy groceries from a departmental store in Karnataka amidst the lockdown. The youth can be heard pleading that they are Indians, that they have Aadhar Cards and that they need groceries just like everybody else to survive. Hopefully, some agency of the State apparatus would intervene again to stop this madness.
The four instances prove that the problem is not confined to a particular part of the country but is all pervasive. In fact so widespread has been the problem that a New Delhi-based rights group, namely, Rights and Risk Analysis Group (RRAG), has recently released a report titled 'Coronavirus Pandemic: India's Mongoloid Looking People Face Upsurge of Racism'. They have cited at least 22 cases of racial discrimination or hate crimes against such people between February 7 and March 25, 2020. What is more worrying apart from the geographical spread is the fact that such acts have taken place in upscale restaurants and campuses of prestigious educational institutions.
As a northeasterner who has spent many years outside the region, this writer has been lucky to have been largely insulated from such racial slurs. However, whenever there is a discussion on racism against the northeasterners, the most common rebuttal is that many 'outsiders' are not treated fairly in the Northeast. Though this is a more complicated story driven by factors such as partition history, landlocked geography, issues of demography and the larger threats emanating from illegal migration, it would not be unwise to revisit this criticism and take stock of what better could be done.
Amidst all the gloom, one positive development is that all these issues are getting a lot of coverage in the national media/web media. On many occasions in the past, many northeasterners feel that the mainstream media has been found wanting on important issues of the Northeast but not so this time. The Government has also taken a serious note of the issue and on March 21 last, the Ministry of Home Affairs has issued an advisory to all the States/UTs to take action against such racial attacks.
It is often said that crisis is the true test of character. The pandemic has caused large-scale panic and fear and the governments across the world are doing all they can to keep the citizens safe. However, as citizens we would also have to give a test of our character and resolve, and the best way to start is by calling out unjust and racist behaviour.

"As pandemic spreads in the US, so do racism and xenophobia",None,Others,2020-04-22,"While the coronavirus epidemic in China has been tamed, it has not stopped Western media, especially those in the US, from trying to exploit the crisis. They have now found another weapon to demonize China, calling it “racist” and “xenophobic.”
This hype has been constant over the past week. The New York Times claimed “as coronavirus fades in China, nationalism and xenophobia flare.”
In China, many foreigners enjoy preferential policies, and overall, foreigners have a better life than the average Chinese. If those Western media intend to label China as “racist” or “xenophobic,” they should dig deeper into specific incidents. The recent allegations of some Africans being discriminated in Guangzhou’s virus-control efforts were actually enhanced measures as the city is facing the rising risk of imported cases and the measures were applied to all residents regardless of race and nationality.
It is ludicrous to see Western media reports pinning the racism label on China while there is a growing number of news reports about Chinese and Asians facing racist abuse in the US, proving that xenophobia has flared there.
In the US, Asian Americans find themselves in the predicament of having to choose between wearing a face mask to protect themselves from the coronavirus, or not wear a mask, to protect themselves from discrimination.
In late March, an American spat on an Asian man in a Brooklyn subway station. Reports also show children of Chinese descent in the US are refusing to wear masks at school because they fear being verbal abused by their classmates.
On Monday night local time, Trump tweeted that he intended to sign “an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States,” a move some US netizens said was xenophobic.
Despite it may be a method evaluated by experts to control the epidemic in the US. Some commented under Trump’s announcement by saying “when immigrant NYers make up more than half of the frontline workers in NYC, the epicenter of America’s #COVID19 pandemic, the President’s response is more xenophobia & fear mongering.”
Racism issue has deep root in the US. The founding of the US south was facilitated by slavery. Even after the Civil War, which ended slavery, the country maintained institutionalized racial discrimination which only began to be eroded in the 1970s. The continued existence of the white supremacist hate group Ku Klux Klan, is proof. In 1882, the US enacted the Chinese Exclusion Act, prohibiting the immigration of Chinese laborers. Discrimination in the US against the Latino population, which rages on today, has its own disgraceful backstory.
Racism and xenophobia are cancer in US society, which has not yet been cured. Among US conservative extremists, many are white supremacists.
When the coronavirus outbreak began, the ingrained mentality in US society again came to the fore, with many blaming China for the pandemic which led to acts of violence toward Asian Americans. The Independent reported on March 24 that “hundreds of Asian Americans have been violently attacked in the last month because of “China virus” racism voiced by [US President] Donald Trump.”
Fox News has hyped its large audience with constant and groundless accusations against China. It wouldn’t exist if its disparaging remarks and extreme ideology weren’t supported by a large swath of Americans.
A vicious circle has been created in the US – media hype accelerates the spread of racism and xenophobia, which perpetuates unprincipled views of people and creates a market that is supplied with unrelenting news stories and commentaries that support racist mindset.
It is uncertain whether the suspension of immigration to the US is an emergency measure or a xenophobic move that will continue after the pandemic ends.
Regardless of whether Trump is to be reelected this year, the next US president is highly likely to make adjustments on Trump’s policies, not for noble reasons but because US politicians know immigrants have made the US what it is today. Racist and xenophobia policies only hurt the US’ unity and national interests.",4103
World: US Government Should Better Combat Anti-Asian Racism,None,Others,2020-04-20,"In Brooklyn, New York, an Asian woman suffered an apparently race-based acid attack while taking out her garbage on April 5. A few weeks earlier in Texas, a man targeted and stabbed a Burmese-American man and his two children, ages 2 and 6, at a Sam's Club. He said he had attempted to kill the family because he believed they were Chinese and infecting people with the coronavirus. One of the children had a laceration wound from his ear across his eye.
These are among the worst examples of thousands of anti-Asian incidents that have been reported since the Covid-19 crisis began. Two weeks after launching its Coronavirus Anti-AAPI Racism Incident Report platform in mid-March, a coalition of Asian-American groups has received over 1,100 reports of incidents of coronavirus-related attacks and racial discrimination. Many more cases likely go unreported.
United States President Donald Trump's use of the term Chinese virus may have fanned the flames, but although he has stepped back from using the term and issued a tweet in support of our Asian-American community, he has not directed a strong governmental response towards protecting Asians and people of Asian heritage. (Notably, although the US is a party to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Trump hasn't nominated a representative to the treaty's monitoring body.)
Still, federal government agencies can act on their own to address this upsurge in racism. The US Commission on Civil Rights has recently raised concerns about the new racism and violence. Additionally, the Department of Education has issued guidance to educators, directing them to protect students at risk of anti-Asian harassment, after a 16-year-old Asian-American boy was attacked by his classmates and hospitalized. And the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has stated that during Covid-19, protecting civil rights and investigating hate crimes remain a high priority. But the FBI should also set up a task force to focus on the specific new problems associated with Covid-19 and better coordinate with local and state officials.
Federal agencies that have stayed silent should also work to protect people from Covid-19 related bigotry. Racism against Asian-Americans is real, and it is dangerous. The US government needs to take it more seriously.",2339
'I've never been leered at so much': The rise of sexual harassment on our lockdown streets,None,Others,2020-04-21,"As International Anti-Street Harassment Week begins, Everyday Sexism's Laura Bates reports on the pandemic side-effect few expected
There’s a joke going around on social media about women and coronavirus. No, not one of the myriad sexist gags circulating about women ‘letting themselves go’ in isolation or men risking infection to get away from their nagging wives. This joke goes that women must love lockdown because at least creepy men aren’t able to harass them any more, thanks to social distancing rules.
Unfortunately, in reality, the opposite seems to be true.
Since writing an article last month about the gendered impact of the pandemic, I’ve been deluged with messages from women describing their recent experiences ahead of International Anti-Street Harassment Week, which runs until April 25.
One woman was walking down the street with her four-year old daughter when men started shouting ""slut"" at her. Another hasn't even been able to walk her dog without being shouted at. Many have described running a distressing gauntlet of sexual comments while exercising. Women have been catcalled in their own front gardens, pursued by men in cars and vans, and followed home.
And a significant number of women, from multiple countries, are reporting that the situation has worsened dramatically during lockdown.
“Is anyone else experiencing more street harassment than usual at this time?” asked one. “Leering and sexual harassment seems to be rife. I have never been ogled, stared at or catcalled so frequently,” wrote another. Several simply agreed: “it seems worse now.”
A woman from Washington, who didn’t want to be named, was walking in her neighbourhood when a man started staring hard at her and then began to follow her. When she crossed the street, so did he. Shops and businesses were shuttered - there was nowhere to go. Finally, she was able to retreat into a corner shop. He followed her. When she asked him to leave her alone, he slammed the iron gate of the shop in anger. After he finally disappeared, she burst into tears.
“I’m used to street harassment,” told me, but during the pandemic, there is “extra fear of someone getting close to you, more fear when there aren’t witnesses, more fear when you can’t rush into an open store for help because most of them are closed.”
Holly Kearl, founder of US non-profit Stop Street Harassment, has been collecting stories of abuse in public spaces. From Argentina to France, she says women have been reporting a spike in street harassment during lockdown. She adds: “Racism and xenophobia is making street harassment worse for those of Asian descent in many parts of the world, including the US, [where] there has been a huge rise in racial harassment against Asian-Americans.”
Emily May, Co-Founder and Executive Director of global grassroots movement Hollaback!, agrees, giving the example of a woman who was walking down the street when a man shouted at her to “keep your Asian disease away”.
In Australia, Melbourne-based campaign It’s Not a Compliment has also seen “a real shift” towards “racially-motivated incidents being targeted at women by complete strangers”. Co-founders Aakanksha Manjunath and Annelise Lecordier told me: “These are issues that have always existed in our society and only require events like this pandemic to bubble up to the surface.”
They say widespread feelings of anger and helplessness have created “an opportunity for some to express these opinions in what they feel is now a more accepting climate... We’ve heard stories of international students being verbally abused while wearing face masks at tram stops, racial slurs being thrown at Asian-Australians while out in public ... Now, this has started to escalate to assault with people reporting being spat on or punched for wearing a face mask. These stories are unfortunately becoming more common and are sadly going mostly unreported.”
With the virus still spreading, some have questioned the importance of an event like International Anti-Street Harassment week during the current crisis.
But May has a robust response: “We know that this moment will change us. What we don’t know yet is how. Do we want to return to a world where girls and women receive nasty, sexualised comments about their bodies? No. We didn’t want that world to begin with. Now we have a break in the action to rethink what we want and build towards what's possible.”
Kearl adds: “Now is the time to plan for a future that has safer public spaces for all-to learn how to be a bystander; to talk about consent and respect and the right way to interact in public spaces.”
And if anyone has a blueprint for what that safer future might look like, it is the Washington woman who was pursued for several blocks. Because after she finally entered the corner shop, she and the owner exchanged “a look between women that we all know too well”, before the owner asked where she lived, locked up her shop and walked her home.

United States: Asian Americans Use Social Media to Mobilize Against Attacks,None,Others,2020-04-06,"Kyle Navarro was kneeling down to unlock his bicycle when he noticed an older white man staring at him. Navarro, who is Filipino, tried to ignore him, but that soon became impossible.
The man walked by, looked back and called Navarro a racial slur. He spat in my direction, and kept walking, Navarro said.
Navarro, a school nurse in San Francisco, already had anxiety about racism related to the coronavirus, which emerged in China and has Asian people facing unfounded blame and attacks as it's spread worldwide. Now, he was outraged.
My first instinct was to yell back at him in anger. But, after taking a breath, I realized that would have put me in danger, Navarro said.
Instead, he took to Twitter last week to turn the ugly moment into an opportunity for a conversation about racism, generating thousands of sympathetic comments.
Asian Americans are using social media to organize and fight back against racially motivated attacks during the pandemic, which the FBI predicts will increase as infections grow. A string of racist run-ins in the last two weeks has given rise to hashtags - #WashTheHate, #RacismIsAVirus, #IAmNotCOVID19 - and online forums to report incidents. Critics say President Donald Trump made things worse by calling COVID-19 the Chinese virus.
For a group with a history of being scapegoated - from Japanese Americans detained during World War II to a Chinese American man killed by autoworkers angry about Japanese competition in the '80s - there's urgency to drown out both bigotry and apathy.
To that end, the California-based groups Chinese for Affirmative Action and the Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council set up a hate reporting center last month. New York's attorney general also launched a hotline.
We kind of just knew from history this was going to snowball, said Cynthia Choi, co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action. With the rising stress and anxiety, we knew we'd see a rise in hate incidents.
The center has fielded more than 1,000 reports from across the U.S., ranging from people spitting to throwing bottles from cars. An FBI report distributed to local law enforcement predicts the attacks will surge and pointed to the stabbing of an Asian American man and his two children at a Sam's Club in Texas last month, ABC News reported. According to the report, the 19-year-old suspect said he thought they were infecting people. The victims have recovered.
Amid the explosive climate, former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang drew backlash for urging fellow Asian Americans to display more American-ness. In a Washington Post editorial Wednesday, he called on them to avoid confrontation and do acts of goodwill like volunteering and helping neighbors.
Being 'the good Asian' has not fared well for Asian Americans, Choi said. We don't have to prove our worth and that we belong, that we're exceptional. And we certainly don't have to believe that this is something that we should ignore.
Yang's spokesman declined to comment.
Meanwhile, Trump has walked back on calling COVID-19 the Chinese virus, saying at a media briefing and on Twitter last week that Asian Americans should not be blamed in any way, shape or form.
Democrats in the U.S. Senate and House worry the damage has been done and have introduced resolutions to condemn anti-Asian racism.
His followers continue to double-down on that term, said U.S. Rep. Judy Chu of California, chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.
Some of the reports received by the advocacy groups describe harassment that appears to parrot Trump, Choi said.
A White House spokesman declined to comment and referred to Trump's remarks at the March 23 briefing.
The president's words also drew some Asian Americans in entertainment and fashion to the #WashTheHate social media campaign last month. Celia Au, star of the Netflix show Wu Assassins, and others posted videos showing them washing their hands and talking about the effect of racism.
   It comes from the top down at the end of the day, Au said. Our top leader is not doing the job, so it's time for us to step up.
People turning against Asian Americans in an uncertain time and sputtering economy echoes the climate in 1982, when Vincent Chin was killed in Detroit as laid-off autoworkers blamed a recession on Japanese competition.
At that time, I knew I had to watch out and be careful - who I was around, how they looked at me, said Helen Zia, a Chinese American author and journalist from Oakland, California, who lived in Detroit at the time. I think we're in that stage now.
Two white autoworkers beat Chin to death with a bat outside a strip club during his bachelor party simply because they thought he was Japanese. The 27-year-old's attackers were convicted of manslaughter and got just three years of probation.
Zia said she and others contacted advocacy groups, churches and Chinese-language media about protesting the sentence. Relying only on mail and telephones, they found allies in the NAACP and Anti-Defamation League and launched demonstrations nationwide.
It was a watershed moment, Zia said. We were drowning, and we had to organize to change what we saw going on around us.
Thanks to social media, younger generations of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are speaking up during what could be another seminal moment. Choi hopes they will rally non-Asians to see the wave of racist attacks in the COVID-19 era as their issue, too. Groups like the NAACP and Council on American-Islamic Relations have condemned anti- Asian rhetoric.
With attacks escalating, Zia can't help but fear the pandemic could result in another tragedy like Chin's death.
The level of anger ... it's already here, Zia said. For Asian Americans, there's the virus of COVID-19 and there's the virus of hate. The hate virus is also going to get much worse. - VOA",5854
Advocates: Anti-Asian harassment on the rise: Incidents appear to grow with virus spread,ANDREA MAY SAHOURI,Others,2020-04-28,"""We've heard or seen it all ... experiencing looks, stares.""
Nu Huynh
executive director of the Iowa Asian Alliance
There would be no large, family birthday celebration for Jing Htun's 7-year-old son, thanks to COVID-19 social distancing restrictions. But she made sure there would be cake.
Htun picked one up from the Hy-Vee bakery on Euclid Avenue on the morning of March 23, her son's birthday. The cake was nothing elaborate, she said, just enough to put a smile on his face.
She made her way to the checkout line. As Htun waited to make her purchase, a white couple stood behind her. She said as soon as they saw she was Asian, they fled.
""(They) said, 'Oh gosh, not here,' and went to another line,"" Htun, who is among the Burmese community in Des Moines, said. ""I have never seen something like that. I've gone to that store so many times.""
Htun is one of the Asian and Pacific Islander community members in Iowa who have witnessed a rise in racism and xenophobia since COVID-19 emerged in Iowa March 8 after the initial outbreak in China in January. There have been few complaints filed with Iowa officials, but Htun and others shared their experiences.
As fears of the virus spread, so too have they seeped into local communities, taking the form of microaggressions — such as the one Htun experienced — against those who are perceived to be from China.
""I don't know how to feel,"" Htun said. ""I just try to ignore it.""
'You can just feel it'
Nu Huynh, executive director of the Iowa Asian Alliance, keeps tabs on potential discrimination tied to COVID-19, a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus.
  ""There are no reported hate crimes at the level of violent acts (in Iowa),"" Huynh told the Des Moines Register and IowaWatch.
In 2017, 2.6% of Iowa's population was Asian, according to the State Data Center, with Des Moines, Ames and Iowa City having the largest numbers. That percentage is projected to grow to 4.4% by 2050, the center reported.
Nationally, Huynh pointed to a more heated atmosphere. She cited the recent spike in hate crimes against Asian and Pacific Islander Americans nationally, President Donald Trump referring to coronavirus as a ""Chinese virus,"" and the stabbing of three members of an Asian-American family — including two small children — in Texas because the suspect thought they were ""Chinese and infecting people with the coronavirus,"" according to an FBI intelligence report.
""We've been very fortunate in that sense,"" Huynh said.
The Iowa Civil Rights Commission has had two race discrimination complaints filed by Asians so far this year, said Elizabeth Johnson, executive director of the commission. There were eight in 2019 and 12 in 2018. Eleven were filed in 2017 with eight in 2016.
Johnson said that under the Iowa Civil Rights Act, any person has 300 days from the last discriminatory incident to file a complaint alleging discrimination. ""Therefore, it is entirely possible that many claims alleging discrimination related to COVID-19 have not yet been filed,"" she wrote by email to the Register and IowaWatch.
Johnson said there has not been an increase in complaints overall as most people are focused on meeting basic needs.
The commission's process is confidential, so more details on complaints filed are not available. ""I can tell you that we have fielded inquiries related to COVID-19 ranging from inquiries about national origin discrimination to inquiries about age discrimination and public accommodations to general inquiries about employment protections and COVID-19 exposure,"" Johnson said.
However, Huynh says microaggressions, whether passive or explicit, are taking a toll on Iowa's Asian and Pacific Islander community. ""We've heard or seen it all ... experiencing looks, stares. You can just feel it,"" she said.
In many cases, particularly nationally, discrimination against Asian and Pacific Islander communities has been more evident, such as the Texas stabbing, which the FBI is treating as a hate crime. But in small cities like Des Moines, microaggressions can be hard to decipher and be underreported.
For instance, Des Moines and Iowa City detectives came across no reports of Asian and Pacific Islander discrimination or hate crimes filed to police in recent months. Ames police found two reports of coronavirus-fueled harassment in April, both involving drivers yelling ""coronavirus"" out of their cars to Asian and Pacific Islanders driving alongside them.
The Register and IowaWatch reached out to others in Iowa's Asian communities who said they had experienced some form of discrimination or harassment due to COVID-19. Several declined to speak on the record because they feared further harassment.
""As an Asian American in times like these we wonder, 'Is it because of me?'"" said Hieu Pham of Monsoon Asians and Pacific Islanders in Solidarity, a Des Moines-based group that assists victims and survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault and human trafficking.
Discrimination faced is sometimes obvious, other times not For some, the discrimination is blatant.
Xiangheng Li, 19, helps out at his family's restaurant — Hong Kong Chinese Restaurant — in Des Moines' Drake neighborhood. It was the beginning of March when his mother, Meifang Zheng, came home from work one evening with a story.
A white middle-aged woman walked into the restaurant that evening. The first thing she asked was if Zheng was Chinese. Zheng said yes. The woman walked out of the restaurant without saying anything.
Li said his mother brushed off the incident; to her, it was nothing new.
""As an immigrant, we have all faced racism in America,"" Li said. ""I think my first reaction was, 'Wow, I can't believe that happened.' But when you think about it, racism still exists in America. I just hope (my mom) doesn't get attacked physically.
""Fears fuel anger, and sometimes it can really hurt people.""
To keep track of incidents in Iowa, the Asian alliance has created an online form where community members can submit reports of harassment and discrimination.
""We must take collective action to prevent and stop these hateful acts. We want to know if our AAPI Iowans are experiencing biased incidents or actions against them due to Coronavirus/COVID-19,"" the organization wrote in a statement.
Post-quarantine fears
Huynh said that discrimination against Asian and Pacific Islander communities is nothing new.
""I think the reality is, these are individuals who have always harbored those feelings. COVID-19 has given them a reason to actually verbalize it, and take action,"" she said. ""It gives them reason to strike, and in their eyes, it's justifiable.""
Pham agreed: ""Racist ideology and racist rhetoric wasn't created by coronavirus; it's already been there. It's been there for a long time.""
""We're not just thinking about anti-Asian sentiment, we're thinking about black and brown folks, too,"" Pham said.
Both Monsoon API and IAA have been creating virtual spaces for the community to continue to support one another.
""We talk about things like how we can still be open, how we can still be providing for API, low income, refugee, immigrant communities,"" Pham said. ""I hope that all of this allows us to have more conversations and think deeper about the history of racism in this country.""

"Opinion: Amid coronavirus crisis, we must fight hate",None,Others,2020-04-26,"The coronavirus pandemic has already shown that times of crisis bring out the best in our fellow citizens. We experience it every day as we marvel at the heroic actions of first- responders, health care professionals, charities and community volunteers. Sadly, however, crises can also bring out the worst. That is why we need to remain vigilant in the fight against hate, conspiracies and scapegoating. Law enforcement, civil rights organizations and media outlets are reporting on increased hate crimes against Asian- Americans, due to the completely mistaken and wrongheaded belief that they have culpability for the pandemic.
While it's clear the Chinese government covered up key information about the coronavirus' initial outbreak in Wuhan, we need to remember that it is the people of China who were the first victims of this policy. Now Asian-Americans of all backgrounds are becoming the targets of harassment, insults and violence.
A man in Texas faces attempted murder charges for attacking an Asian-American family of four in a supermarket and stabbing three of them, including a two-year-old and a six- year-old child, claiming they were responsible for spreading coronavirus.
The website Stop AAPI Hate has fielded over 1,500 recent hate incident reports including 11 in New York City. Such scapegoating is particularly outrageous when one considers that 17% of doctors and 10% of nurses in our country ��� those putting their lives on the line to help pro tect our families and neighbors ���are Asian-American.
Jews are all too familiar with disease-related scapegoating throughout history.
During the Black Plague in Europe in the Middle Ages, Jewish people were scapegoated and killed mercilessly by fanatics across the continent. Over 600 entire Jewish communities were destroyed. Many killers claimed that Jews had poisoned wells to spread the plague, or that the plague was a Jewish plot to decimate Christian communities. Never mind that Jews died in horrific numbers during the plague as well. Sadly, modern anti-Semites are right now on the internet weaving similarly insane conspiracy theories blaming Jews for spreading coronavirus.
Indeed, the Simon Wiesenthal Center just turned over a list of some 45 channels on social media platforms like Telegram and Gab to United States Attorney General William Barr and Homeland Security that promote lurid conspiracy theories linking Jews to the pandemic and urging those suffering from CoronaVirus to go to synagogues and mosques to spread the deadly virus.
None of us is immune from accidentally falling prey to misinformation that can hurt our neighbors. One of us Councilman Joshi posted a thoughtless tweet that potentially could have hurt my Jewish neighbors. As an Indo-American I should have known better. I apologized and toured the nearby Jewish community and learned first-hand of their commitment and struggle to help fight the pandemic.
Working together with all people of good faith we will hopefully soon be beneficiaries of a vaccine to stop the pandemic. But no one has yet come up with a cure for history's oldest virus hate.
We all must reject any and all efforts seeking to conflate justified anger at the Chinese communist government with anger towards Asian-Americans. This is the height of hypocrisy, and insulting to the many Chinese-Americans who fled to our country specifically to escape repression by the Chinese government. We should never blame immigrants from any country for the actions of a foreign government that they have no control over.
What can we do to fight hate and protect our neighbors? First, be sure to report any incidents to the proper authorities. Please also submit anti-Asian American incidents in New Jersey to the office of Councilman Sam Joshi and to national Stop AAPI Hate website. If you experience an anti-Semitic incident or see anti-Semitic remarks on social media please contact ireport@wiesenthal.com.
Also, continue to check in on your neighbors ��� regardless of their background. The pandemic has taught us that we are all in the same boat. Let's be sure we don't allow the bigots to exploit this crisis. By showing we care about each other, we can emerge from the pandemic stronger and more united than ever.

Coronavirus Provokes Incidents of Hatred,"Panzer, Sophie",Others,2020-04-23,"AS THE CORONAVIRUS SPREAD across the globe, so too did the search for scapegoats.
""Were definitely seeing a rehashing of old stereotypes and tropes,"" said Shira Goodman, regional director of the AntiDefamation League Philadelphia.
Racist and anti-Semitic coronavirus content has proliferated on social media and online messaging platforms. Many of the posts suggest Jews created or spread the coronavirus on purpose and are profiting from it.
""Not ONE media outlet has asked about George Soros's involvement in this FLU pandemic. He is SOMEWHERE involved in this,"" former Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. tweeted on March 15.
""Does President Donald Trump have coronavirus? Are Israel and the Global Zionist elite up to their old tricks?"" former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke tweeted three days earlier.
Others have posted memes encouraging people with COVID-19 to cough in kosher supermarkets or on minorities. Some white supremacists advocate for stealing African Americans' supplies in preparation for a race war.
Goodman said Zoom bombing - infiltrating a Zoom meeting with offensive and hateful material - has become a big issue for Jewish organizations moving their events online.
""People are putting up images of Nazis and swastikas and the Ku Klux Klan,"" Goodman said. ""We saw some instances of people in online groups looking for passwords to events to disrupt.""
While it may sound like a prank, Zoom bombing has dark implications for communities trying to connect during difficult times. Goodman said it may make elderly people trying to participate in a virtual minyan scared to join, or it could traumatize students learning online.
""The goal of somebody who is going to do Zoom bombing to attack a class or service is to have a big impact with low risk. When this happens, the bomber has created division and stoked fear,"" she explained.
She said the ADL has worked with Attorney General Josh Shapiro and Zoom to create more safety features for users. The company has responded by creating a waiting room feature and adjusted settings so that only speakers can share their screens. (For more on Zoom bombing and the ADL response, see Jonathan Greenblatt's opinion piece in this issue.)
Rue Landau, executive director of the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations, has experienced Zoom bombings.
""I was participating in a legal services housing information session that was quickly overtaken by a Zoom bomber who put up homophobic and transphobic, racist and antiSemitic visuals and language in the chat that was hateful,"" she said.
The hateful content played on a loop.
""I've seen a lot. This one was traumatizing. The visuals and the language, including the N-word in capital letters, it just kept happening, and they had to shut off the meeting.""
In addition to Zoom bombing, Landau said PCHR, a city agency that enforces civil rights anti-discrimination laws, has seen a significant rise in anti-Asian hate crimes and bias incidents since the pandemic reached the United States.
From Jan. 1 to April 15, the PCHR recorded 32 incidents of hate, including hate speech, property offenses and assault and robbery. Twenty-one of these incidents have been confirmed as hate-related, and 17 were motivated by anti-Asian and COVID-19 biases.
Of the 11 cases not yet confirmed as hate-related, six were alleged anti-Asian and COVID-19 incidents. One recently reported offense involved a group of perpetrators who yelled COVID-19 related slurs at an Asian man before assaulting him and stealing his car.
""They've been blamed for starting the pandemic. People have been physically pushed or assaulted, especially if they were wearing masks. Basically, the Asian communities do not feel safe because they say that they are receiving threats,"" Landau said.
Goodman has heard the same kinds of reports.
""What we've heard from friends in the Asian American community is someone will hear someone was attacked or yelled at outside and that makes them afraid to go out for necessary things,"" she said.
Goodman and Landau noted the African American community has experienced racism for wearing masks: Black men are likely to be viewed with suspicion and fear if they cover their faces, even if they are doing so in compliance with safety regulations.
The ADL and PCHR have distributed materials with instructions on reporting hate crimes and bias incidents. Blog posts and flyers have been translated into Chinese, Vietnamese and Khmer to make them more accessible.
Both Goodman and Landau said it is crucial that minorities feel safe reporting incidents because it helps law enforcement and civil rights organizations track perpetrators.
Goodman said that President Donald Trump's insistence on calling the virus ""China Flu"" has further obscured the fact that the disease doesn't discriminate based on origin or race. The ADL has co-authored op-eds with leaders in the Asian American community, including the Asian American Chamber of Congress in Philadelphia, to advocate for unity.
""We want to be good allies and stand up for our neighbors,"" Goodman said.",5078
Social stigma during COVID-19 pandemic,"Gupta, Tula Krishna",Others,2020-04-09,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been stressful for communities across the globe. It has perpetrated a level of anxiety in all populations, which has led to stigma towards certain people – especially Asian Americans in the US. The current outbreak has provoked stigma in Nepal as well. Health care workers, COVID-19 patients or suspects and people who have returned home from abroad are having to face these stigmas.
A few days back, an adult male presented himself in our fever clinic at the Charikot Primary Health Care Centre with a history of sore throat and cough. He had returned from South Korea a month back and had lived in self-quarantine for 21 days. None of his family members showed any symptoms. He and his family members were, however, facing persistent discrimination from neighbours.
He came to us after someone posted his name and address in the social media, accusing him of possibly spreading the disease in his village. Thus, he demanded a test for COVID-19 to prove he did not have the virus.
The very next day, a young female who had returned from Dubai 11 days back came to us demanding a test. She had absolutely no symptoms. But she came to our hospital after walking more than four hours because her community had pressured her to get the test.
Social stigma in the context of health is the negative association between a person or group of people who share certain characteristics and a specific disease. Mental disorders, AIDS, venereal diseases, leprosy and the like are diseases that are stigmatised in our community – by limiting social participation. Stigma is not limited to the person suffering from the disease but extends to one’s family members, too.
Stigma is associated with the COVID- 19 outbreak because of its highly contagious nature and relatively high mortality. Stigmatisation has huge impact on a patient as well as the quality of care he or she receives from the health institutions. The patient might keep away from seeking help for the illness for fear of discrimination. In Dolakha, there are lots of migrant workers from India, and yet they are not seeking care at the nearby health centres because of this fear. Also, there are cases where after a recent foreign country visit, people hide themselves from the community so that their family member need not go through the negative consequences.
Stories of people with fever being denied health care in private hospitals all across the country are rampant in the media. The COVID-19 stigma is unique because of the discrimination that health care workers and medical students face along with the patients. While there are many people motivating health care workers in this fight against the disease, there are also those who see us as potential COVID-19 carriers. Stories of forced evictions of health care workers are published every day. The entire staff of Sindhuli hospital, who lived on rent, were evicted by their landlords last week.
A final year BDS student who returned to Nepal from Bangladesh faced similar discrimination. He had returned two weeks back and was in isolation for those two weeks. He did not show any symptoms nor did his family members. But he faced extreme pressure from the community to go and get tested for COVI-19. Neighbours went as far as to complain to the police. Then ward chairperson requested the family to get checked in our hospital.
They came to us, but there was nothing to check. They were not the ones with the problem. The real problem was the stigma towards possible COVID-19 patients that was slowly rooting in our society. There are stories of hate crimes in the USA against Asian Americans following the outbreak. We haven’t reached that stage. But if there is an outbreak, people with a travel history, health care workers and family members of COVI-19 patient or suspects could face stigma in the form of social rejection, physical violence and denial of health care.
There is a need to intervene against this stigma now before it spreads its roots. We need urgent advocacy in the community through policy makers and community leaders. The Mayor of Bhimeshwor Municipality has been actively engaged in limiting the stigma of this disease through community engagement.
There is a lot we need to do. But we have done it before, for diseases like leprosy and HIV/AIDS. We need a national plan to combat the stigma against COVID-19 with strong monitoring. We need to engage social influencers as well as religious leaders and celebrities to talk about such stigma in the community and ways to prevent it.
Journalists should focus their stories on the positive things to minimise the stigma rather than speculating on the facts about COVID-19. Researchers and programme evaluators should intervene in time to reduce its harmful effects in the future.
According to the CDC (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention), communicators and public health officials can be key persons to help counter stigma during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are a number of ways to do this:

Seymour rallies behind Asian-American restaurant owners after coronavirus-motivated threats,"Eng, Donald",Others,2020-04-10,"SEYMOUR —A local family confronted with apparent racially motivated threats at their Asian restaurant has been overwhelmed by the community response.
“I didn’t expect the community to react the way that it did,” said Meng Zheng, whose parents Ju Zheng and Xuemei Chen own Sushi & Wok. “I’m glad that it did, though.”
The restaurant has been swamped with orders, received more than 150 messages of support on social media and got an offer of $1,000 to be used to pay for the meals of local emergency responders and health workers.
The incident that put it all into motion occurred April 3 just before noon, Zheng said. “It was right as the lunch rush was starting,” she said.
The restaurant received six calls from two different phone numbers blaming Chinese people for the COVID-19 pandemic and threatening to shoot up the restaurant in a profanity-filled rant, she said. The caller also seemed to be trying to disguise his voice, Zheng said.
The calls were sufficiently alarming that her parents called Zheng at her job at Yale New Haven Hospital.
She notified the police and relayed the information since there is a language barrier. Seymour police confirmed a report had been filed but did not respond to a request for further details.
Later, Zheng said, she began growing angry that her family had been the target of racial bias and took to the restaurant’s Facebook page to vent.
“As we struggle to keep our business open, not only do we face the challenges of paying rent and dues, but we also deal with harassments from people who threaten to do harm to our employees and business,” she wrote. “Many people have no idea how difficult it is to continue operating a small restaurant with the constant fear that someone will come in and tear the place down. There is no need to spread ignorance, hatred, and destruction in our community in a time like this.”
  The response was immediate.
“I’m so sorry that some individuals have so much hate in their hearts and are so ignorant as to blame an entire culture for something that is a worldwide issue,” wrote Alison Vance, a customer since the restaurant opened in 2013. “Much love to you and your family.”
Julie Mary agreed.
“This broke my heart to read,” she wrote. “No one is immune to this virus; it does not discriminate. I think it’s fair to say it’s showing us all of us are equals. No one should be threatening anyone, least of all the people are working hard to continue to provide food to their community.”
Jacklyn Meeker was more blunt.
“Don’t let all the (expletives) bring you down,” she wrote.
Though the night passed without incident, Zheng said the community support ironically caused her a brief moment of alarm.
“I called around 5 o’clock to check in, and no one answered the phone, the line was just dead,” she said. “I texted and called their cellphones, and when no one replied I rushed over there. It was probably an overreaction, but I was thinking the worst-case scenario.”
Everyone at the restaurant was fine, just busy, she said.
“So many people were calling and ordering from them, I ended up staying there and working for the night,” she said.
After work, Zheng made a follow-up post thanking the Seymour Police Department for having a patrol car check in on the restaurant throughout the night.
A few days later, the town’s Board of Selectman took time in their April 7 meeting to voice their support for her parents’ restaurant.
“These people are Seymour residents just as much as all of us,” First Selectman Kurt Miller said to the board. “There is no place for this negativity in town, and I love seeing all the support.”
Miller chalked the threats up to a “keyboard warrior,” a slang term generally used to describe someone who makes aggressive comments online, where he can conceal his identity.
Other selectmen echoed the sentiment, referring to the threats as “reprehensible” and expressing their pride at the community’s coming together behind the family.
Tom Haynes, owner of a local construction materials and hardware business, took note of the incident and was waiting at the restaurant when it opened April 8, offering $1,000 to buy meals for health care workers and emergency responders.
Zheng said the family was grateful for the offer, and was trying to think of a way to implement the donation since they currently have no way of knowing who is placing orders.
“We’re only accepting orders through the apps right now,” she said.
Perhaps, when the pandemic subsides, the donation could be used to host a thank-you party for those who fought the virus, Zheng said. “That would be great,” she said.",4593
Asian celebrities against racist attacks on the pandemic,"Maher, Bill",Others,2020-04-28,"NEW YORK (AP) — Actress Olivia Cheng recently volunteered in Vancouver, where she said she saw a man stop with his car next to an old Chinese woman, roll down the window and yell ""This is your fault!"" before throwing trash at the woman.
The incident infuriated Cheng and was also one of the reasons he feels it is so important that Asian celebrities use their voices and speak out against attacks on the Asian community, which authorities say have increased during the coronavirus pandemic.
""I don't think we can pretend this isn't happening,"" Cheng, who performs in CBS All Access's ""The Stand,"" said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. ""For now, it wouldn't be unwise to be a little more careful, perhaps using companionship systems when possible to go out and buy food if you don't feel safe.""
The FBI reported an increase in hate crimes and harassment against Asian Americans since the COVID-19 outbreak, which first appeared in Wuhan, China, late last year.
Some people have blamed China and Asians in general for the spread of coronavirus. President Donald Trump himself has sometimes called it the ""Chinese virus.""
In New York, state attorney general Letitia James created a helpline to report harassment and other types of hatred aimed at specific groups. Some of those incidents have been filmed and posted on social media.
The protagonist of ""Tigertail"" Tzi Ma said he has been the victim of such harassment. He was recently entering a supermarket in Pasadena, California, when a man in a car confronted him.
""He saw me right in the eye and said 'you should be quarantined,' and he left,"" said the veteran actor, who was born in Hong Kong and moved to the United States as a child.
""Obviously I was very angry, I felt a cold running through my body and I started yelling at him, but I was too far away to listen to myself.""
Actor Alain Uy, from Hulu's forthcoming premiere series ""Marvel's Helstrom"", feared from the outset that such incidents would occur after the virus spread.
""Once this outbreak happened in Wuhan, like we all said 'OK, we know what this is going to mean,'"" said the Philippine-born actor.
""Crazy Rich Asians"" director Jon M. Chu said he has felt he should be more careful than usual. ""It's very sad when I feel a little weird when I go for a walk around the block,"" he said.
""The Real"" co-host Jeannie Mai, who has Vietnamese and Chinese ancestry, recently revealed that she first needed someone to review her social media to erase racist comments.
""The Good Doctor"" actor Will Yun Lee even gets nervous about taking his son to the supermarket: ""My wife is Caucasian, but my son is half Korean and half white. But it looks very Asian.""
Ma and other celebrities have decided to speak up and work to combat ignorance and harassment. Ma joined actress Celia Au and other celebrities and influencers in the recent ""Wash the Hate"" campaign created by IW Group, a marketing agency focused on Asian Americans. The public service announcement shows Ma, Au and others washing their hands and reminding people that hygiene, not xenophobia, is the way to fight the virus.
""If I can start the conversation, why not?"" said Au, who was also born in Hong Kong. ""If we don't talk about it, then there will be no talk of this at all.""
For Cheng, the recent anti-Asian wave revived painful memories of his childhood in Edmonton,Canada, where she was the victim of an attack as a teenager.
He found a whole series of attacks posted on the internet. ""I had to stop looking, "" he said. ""He relived all those feelings again, of being a girl and not being able to do anything.""
Mai said it is not only important for Asian stars to speak out against these attacks, but also for people of other races.
""These are conversations we should have with our children in the house. You have to, even if you're not Chinese. You should explain to them that this is terrible, that racism is sprouting in this pandemic,"" he said. ""Talk about it with your children. Have this conversation with your friends. If one of your friends says, 'this Chinese virus is crazy', say 'no, in fact, it's called COVID-19. It's not the 'Chinese virus'. Just correct them.""
This month, Bill Maher, host of the HBO show Real Time wit Bill Maher, defended the coronavirus from calling the coronavirus the ""Chinese virus"", when compared to the Spanish flu.
""Even if people say it's innocuous and came from China, it's the background,"" Lee said. ""Certain people will take those (racist) tones and attach them to them.""
There is also concern that anti-Asian-American sentiment will translate into a setback in Hollywood following the
recent success of Asian stories.
This year, the South Korean film ""Parasite"" won the Oscar for Best Picture, and Chinese-American director Lulu Wang took the Independent Spirit Award for her film ""The Farewell"". ""Crazy Rich Asians"" was a box office success in 2018 and last year Sandra Oh became the first Asian woman in 39 years to win the Golden Globe for Best TV Actress for the ""Killing Eve"" series.
""I'm worried that it's going to impact our opportunities so soon after we finally feel like we're making progress,"" Cheng said. ""Will this make us go backwards I don't know how many steps back?""
Ma said the only way forward is to keep telling diverse stories.
""You mustn't give in. We'll keep moving forward. And I hope one day people will say, 'You know what? Not only do I accept the differences, but also the fact that we look a lot alike.'""",5468
Using pandemics to promote racism and xenophobia,None,Others,2020-04-15,"Pakistan, April 15 -- The coronavirus pandemic has Americans across the country fearful for their personal health and well-being, but for Asian Americans, the virus has stirred up another threat: a wave of verbal and physical attacks.
In the most egregious hate crime thus far, an Asian American family, including a two-year-old girl, was stabbed at a Sam's Club Store in Midland, Texas. The attacker admitted to police that he tried to kill them because he believed they were Chinese people infecting Americans with the coronavirus.
Another victim Julie Kang, 30, said she was first verbally assaulted in December, when coronavirus cases were just beginning to surface in China. A man walked up to her in the middle of downtown San Diego, got in her face, and called her racial slurs. It took a moment for her to register what happened, she said, and she tried to shrug it off.
Joe Biden, the apparent Democratic presidential nominee, has publicly condemned the rising violence and number of attacks directed at the Asian American community related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In his statement, Biden brought up several recent instances of violence toward Asian Americans. One woman, Yuanyuan Zhu, was spit on last month on her way to the gym as the perpetrator shouted a China-related expletive at her. In a separate incident, an Asian woman was doused with a substance outside her home in Brooklyn, New York, resulting in chemical burns to her face and body.
""These disgusting and racist acts must stop. They are grounded in an impulse that is as ugly as it is dangerously ignorant,"" Biden said.
It doesn't help that President Donald Trump and the GOP have been calling Covid-19 the ""Chinese virus,"" putting a target on East Asian Americans. It fits into his administration's pattern of xenophobia (referring to Mexicans as ""rapists,"" and labeling some places ""shithole countries""), which also fits into his pattern of deflecting blame - this time as criticism mounts against the government's handling of the coronavirus crisis.
After a week of this rhetoric, Trump tweeted that ""it was very important we protect our Asian American community"" (before othering Asian Americans - ""they"" and ""us"" - one tweet later) on Monday, but the damage has already been done.
The ""Chinese virus"" rhetoric coming from the White House has real-world consequences for Chinese-Americans (and relationships with China broadly).
As coronavirus has spread across the U.S., so have reports of violence against people of Asian descent, and the FBI warns a surge in hate crimes could be yet to come.
Let us be clear. COVID-19 is not a ""foreign virus."" It is not a ""Chinese virus."" It is not the ""Wuhan virus."" It is a human virus that does not discriminate based on ethnic background or race.",2769
The taste of community Chinese restaurant targeted amid virus sees surge of support,"Rago, Gordon",Others,2020-04-28,"
CHESAPEAKE - The owner of a restaurant in Chesapeake says her car was recently vandalized with anti-Chinese graffiti, an attack that apparently fit a national trend of hate attacks during the coronavirus pandemic.
And now customers are stepping up to show their support for the business.
Linda Lin Cheng has owned Taste of China for the last 20 years. The small restaurant is tucked away in a shopping center off Battlefield Boulevard. Cheng and her husband run the place by themselves.
On Sunday, Cheng told a longtime customer, Barbara Sgueglia, someone came in the day before and threw water on them. Sgueglia also said Cheng told her someone painted ""go back to China"" on her car. Cheng confirmed to a Virginian-Pilot reporter that happened to her car but couldn't speak further Monday as her restaurant was too busy.
People have also come into the restaurant screaming words similar to what was painted on her car.
Since the outbreak of the coronavirus, which originated in China, reports like this have been increasing across the United States. The nonprofit Stop AAPI Hate has received 1,500 reports of coronavirus discrimination against Asian Americans since it established a reporting center on March 19. The reports include verbal harassment, shunning and assault.
After talking with Cheng on Sunday, Sgueglia posted about the conversation on Facebook and floated the idea of helping the business out to show the community's support. The post garnered hundreds of shares and comments. A Facebook event for a tailgate to order food, and write cards and supportive messages in chalk outside the restaurant attracted hundreds more.
""My heart breaks for them,"" one commenter wrote. ""We are all in this together and no one should be treated like this. I'm all in on supporting this family and their business.""
A Chesapeake police spokesman, officer Leo Kosinski, said his department was made aware of the original post about the vandalism and harassment and sent an officer to Taste of China on Monday, but the owner didn't have time to talk. As of 3 p.m., an official report was not yet filed.
By lunchtime Monday, the restaurant was slammed with takeout orders and Cheng and her husband were too busy to answer the phone. Chesapeake resident Elizabeth Higgins heard what happened to the restaurant and decided she wanted to support it. Her son is a sous chef in Pennsylvania and she's heard of Chinese restaurants there seeing big declines in business during the coronavirus. As the orders kept coming in Monday, Higgins said she waited for more than an hour for her order of chicken chow mein and orange chicken.
""Right now, it's best to support the local businesses,"" she said.
Sgueglia is encouraging people to ""spread the love"" throughout the week, as she doesn't want to overwhelm the restaurant. She plans to be out for the tailgate Monday from 6 to 8 p.m. with some music and chairs. She had plans to gather money in red envelopes to give to Cheng and her husband.
Sgueglia, who owns a real estate and property management firm in Chesapeake, got to know Cheng over the years. Sgueglia hosts exchange students who attend private schools around Hampton Roads and the students are picked up and dropped off in the parking lot where Taste of China is located. They would sometimes pop into the restaurant when they waited for Sgueglia to come take them home. She described Cheng and her husband as hard workers who never take vacations and are trying to put their son through college.
She said it's important to surround people and help them out when they go through harassment like this.
""It's so easy to just say people are ignorant. But you don't get a pass,"" Sgueglia said. ""You don't get a pass and get to be ignorant and hateful and hurt other people because you believe somebody else did something. But I think the solution is that when we see these kinds of things happen to people, we wrap them up in love. We lift them up and we come together and we just help them and we love them through it.""

Coffee shop owner sounds alarm against Wuhan plague plaques,Randall ,Others,2020-04-26,"A coffee shop owner described as ""super gross and racist"" a sticker she found on her business of a panda holding chopsticks under the words ""Wuhan plague."" 
Krystile McNeil Rodriguez took to Facebook to express her concerns saying ""there's enough xenophobia and ignorance being spouted from this administration we certainly don't need street art reinforcing this sh*t."" 
She says the stickers have been plastered throughout Atlanta and urged people who see them to report it to police. 
Rodriguez informed her landlord immediately after seeing the vandalism and says her landlord immediately came to rip them off the building. 
""It's doing nothing but reinforcing really awful stereotypes,"" said Rodriguez.""I have Asian American friends that said it's allergy season and they're afraid to sneeze in public because of all of the hate speech."" 
Asian Americans have reported increased harassment around the globe since the novel coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China. Asians make up 4% of Atlanta's population, according to U.S. Census data. 
Advancing Justice-Atlanta, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting the civil rights of Asian American communities in Georgia and the Southeast, called the signs ""hateful and dangerous rhetoric (that) has consequences."" 
""Chinese Americans and those perceived to be are now victims of violence,"" the organization said in a statement. ""These plaques are the latest incident to harass the Asian American community and it is important we all condemn it. Hate has no place here."" 
""It's doing nothing but reinforcing really awful stereotypes,"" said Rodriguez to the Atlantic Journal Constitution. ""I have Asian American friends that said it's allergy season and they're afraid to sneeze in public because of all of the hate speech."" 
Many pushed back on Rodriguez on her Facebook page saying they didn't see the racism in the stickers. 
Advancing Justice-Atlanta, however, backed up Rodriguez' concerns. 
""Chinese Americans and those perceived to be are now victims of violence,"" the organization said in a statement. ""These plaques are the latest incident to harass the Asian American community and it is important we all condemn it. Hate has no place here."" 
Vietnamese American animator Rod Ben told the Journal-Constitution the stickers encourages people to place blame on those from Asian countries and Asian American residents. 
""I'm worried for my parents going to the grocery store. Even older people are being harassed and attack, and if you're not going to leave old people alone, where is (the harassment) going to stop?""

Actor fends off racism,"Paradkar, Shree",Others,2020-03-25,"It was a bright day in North Bay a week or so ago, just days before the nation ground to a halt. Canadian actor Russell Yuen, 54, was relaxing by picturesque Lake Nipissing during a break from filming, his sunglasses perched on his nose as he absorbed the icy beauty in front of him.
A white couple walked up and stood nearby. Presently the man spoke. This is Yuen's account of what happened next. The man said, ""It's so much nicer here than Toronto. We can get away from that Chinese virus.""
Yeun turned to him said, ""Excuse me?""
The man said, ""Oh you know, the virus that Chinese people brought over.""
So Yuen took off his glasses and said, ""Please repeat that again.""
At that, the man turned verbally abusive. ""You f---ing Chinese man, why aren't you wearing a f---ing mask? Get the f--- away from me. You and your f---ing virus, go back to where you came from.""
Yuen is fourth-generation Canadian. His ancestors literally united Canada - they came here to build the Canadian Pacific Railway, upon which rested British Columbia's decision to join Confederation in the late 1800s.
He said, ""You mean, Montreal?""
""Don't be a f---ing smartass,"" the man said. ""You know what I'm f---ing talking about.""
""Meanwhile his wife is hiding behind him,"" Yuen said. ""Like I'm the alien creature from ""Alien"" that could spit acid at her and dissolve her or something.""
""I said 'Look, you're entitled to your opinion but you're wrong.'"" And as Yuen walked back to his room, the man kept swearing, saying ""We're going to get out of this place. I can't believe they're letting those types of people in here.""
This wasn't Yuen's only recent experience with racism since the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. And bigots being bigots everywhere, he is one of the rising number of people of East Asian descent being singled out around the world and blamed for the deadly virus.
A few things need unpacking in light of this renewed racism. First, people of East Asian descent need systemic support. Second, it establishes why COVID-19 should never be called the Chinese virus. Third, the brazen bigotry has blown the facade off the ""model minority"" myth.
The Indian actor Meiyang Chang was out for a jog on the streets of Mumbai recently when two guys sped past him on a bike, ""screaming 'corona' and laughing,"" he told media. He gets teased by friends, which he told media he didn't mind, but he also gets randomly called ""corona"" on Instagram, which he does.
American writer/journalist Jeff Yang shared his ""first 'breathing while Asian' moment"" on Twitter. An older white woman with a mask turned on him at a grocery store and shouted ""F--- you.""
""As I stared at her, she pulled off her mask, coughed directly at me, turned on her heel and walked off."" Other Asian Americans responded with their own experiences on Yang's Twitter feed.
Sinophobia being rampant in the U.S. isn't surprising. That country's president read a speech last week on which, as a Washington Post photographer captured, the word ""corona"" was scratched out and replaced with ""Chinese."" All the better to cover his own ineffectual response that led to the U.S. swiftly becoming the world's third-most affected country.
It's not racist, Donald Trump insisted. It's just where the virus originated.
Calling it Chinese serves no purpose other than to stigmatize a group of people. Viruses have been named after geographical areas even if they didn't originate there. The Spanish flu, for instance. After the outbreak of MERS - or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - in 2012, the WHO recommended not naming viruses after regions to mitigate negative impacts on places and peoples. Instead, it encourages descriptive terms - respiratory, pulmonary - whom it impacts by age - geriatric, senile - whether acute or chronic etc.
New York recently established a new hotline to report hate crimes against Asian Americans. Canadian police jurisdictions should consider either doing the same or expanding their existing lines and work on targeted outreach so more people know whom to call. Toronto police's Hate Crimes Unit had not seen an increase in reports, but ""hate-related crime often goes unreported to police,"" said police spokesperson Meaghan Gray, who encouraged people to report it by calling 416-808-2222.
It's virtually impossible to prove hate crimes unless people walk around with cameras turned on. However, hotlines can document incidents and connect people to legal resources. The rest of us don't need to be silent bystanders either. (Obviously, if dangerous, call 911.)
On Saturday, Yuen was going about his business heading to a grocery store in Montreal when a white staffer blocked the automatic doors from opening and yelled through the glass: ""Go put on a f---ing mask and gloves.""
Explicit spoken racism is verbal assault. It can leave people feeling shell-shocked and scarred. But the daily subtler forms take a different toll. For Yuen, that comes in the looks he gets in public, the extra-wide berth people give him, but not his white wife while walking, the overly watchful eyes as he picks up things in a store.
These experiences have left Yuen flooded with ""that feeling of racism I used to get when I was much younger."" That was a time of growing up in Montreal when he was the only Asian person, ""the only Asian in elementary school, one of two Asians in high school, the only Asian in theatre school.""
Both East Asians and South Asians are touted as model minorities in western nations. Look how well they do in school. Look how much they earn. Look how hard-working they are. Look how they fit in without complaining.
Whiteness - the system of racial hierarchy - works such that this praise is less directed toward the so-called models and more geared toward taunting Black and Indigenous people for their poverty and their resistance to assimilating to European norms. ""If they can do it, why can't you"" is also a tactic to avoid settler accountability.
As the COVID-19 fallout shows, that veneer of praise for Asians is as thin as it is insincere.
""One thing I've learnt as I've grown older is that what our parents said - 'keep your head down, work hard and you'll be rewarded' - unfortunately it's not true,"" Yuen said. ""You have to speak up. You have to show people the racism that other people don't see. You have to call people out.""",6315
Coronaphobia fuels anti-Chinese sentiment: Op-ed,None,Others,2020-03-24,"Discrimination against China and Chinese people is nothing new – Sinophobia is a well-documented phenomenon that has occurred for centuries.
However, the miscellaneous ways it has revealed itself during the coronavirus crisis reveals the increasingly complex relationship between China and the rest of the world. Sinophobia stems from historical resentment, fears of economic competition and racism. Fear of all Chinese is also linked to past ethnic trends and, at present, the coronavirus.
In places where Asians constitute a minority such as Europe, the United States, and Australia, Sinophobia seems to be incited by the profound stereotypes of the Chinese as dirty and uncivilized. Headlines such as “Yellow peril,” Chinese virus “panda-monium” and
“Chinese kids, stay home” have appeared in French and Australian newspapers. Some Chinese students were also beaten in the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, some Chinese citizens have not been admitted to hotels and restaurants or shunned by public transport.
And all the while, the web is dotted with mocking memes about the coronavirus.
The anti-Chinese rhetoric has also gained a sharper and more xenophobic tone in Asia. One common theme has been worries about
mainland Chinese overrunning and infecting local populations.
In Singapore and Malaysia, hundreds of thousands have signed petitions demanding a total ban on Chinese nationals entering their countries; in response, both countries’ governments have implemented some form of entry ban. In Japan, some have dubbed the Chinese “bio-terrorists,” while conspiracy theories about the Chinese infecting locals, particularly Muslims, have predominated in Indonesia and elsewhere.
It is crystal clear that the flourishing prosperity of the Chinese has also culminated in ever-increasing numbers of tourists and students visiting and living in numerous parts of the world, resulting in their increased visibility on the ground. Reports of sporadic
crude behavior, combined with their sheer numbers, have given rise to the stereotype of Chinese tourists as boors or Chinese students as ultra-rich.
Of course, Sinophobia is not ubiquitous, as populations in South America, Africa, and Eastern Europe view China more positively, according to the Pew Center for Research.
“In recent years, a remarkable amount of anti-China sentiment has originated in the U.S., especially under the Trump administration,” said Professor Barry Sautman, a sociologist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Like President Donald Trump, for instance, most American media outlets insist on calling the recent coronavirus outbreak as a “Chinese virus.”
“The U.S. itself has had a long history of Sinophobia, most notably with the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, which banned Chinese laborers following immigration that began with the Gold Rush. The current wave coincides, and is perhaps in part due to, the rise in nativism in the U.S., as well as the rest of the world,” said Sautman.
“Now, China is seen as a challenger to U.S. hegemony, and almost every aspect of what the Chinese government does has been criticized heavily. As a result, lots of people around the world pick up on that, and it builds upon Sinophobia that has been historically embedded, like that in Asia,” he said.
The U.S. was the first country to impose a travel ban on Chinese travelers and the first to suggest a partial withdrawal of its embassy staff.
Obviously, the West fears the hideous pathogen of COVID-19, precisely because – short of very extreme measures – we are almost powerless to hinder its entry. The analogy in the Western subconscious is that: COVID-19 and China: both foreign contagions, carried by air, indifferent to borders and boundaries, and indifferent to the bodies they enter, are capable of wreaking havoc on core functions.
Whatever the historical cause of this relentless phobia, the present trigger is the inexorable rise of China as an economic and military superpower – a power that is increasingly inclined to demand deference and respect. Today, most commentators regard China as both a security threat and an economic enabler. It’s both. That’s why coronavirus is becoming a Western excuse for Sinophobia and China-bashing.
The media plays a prominent role in this. The use of fake news and misinformation as instruments to foment hate against China is a reason to fear the Western axis. In contrast, China must act against these attacks with the same energy that is being utilized against the coronavirus just because both are real threats and national security issues.
Amid the controversy and racism, an editorial published in The Lancet, a prestigious medical journal, on March 8 said: “The Chinese government has saved tens of thousands of lives. Isn’t making sure as many people as possible avoid contracting a dangerous virus the highest form of human rights?” China seems to have succeeded in bringing the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic under control, as Wuhan has reported zero infections for the first time. In doing so, it is trying to protect the health of the entire world population.
We hence owe a debt of gratitude to all officials and volunteers who are working around the clock to contain the virus and to treat those suffering from it. China is doing its best to help Italy and could be leading the way in developing a vaccine against COVID- 19.
It is therefore high time for unity and solidarity for all to combat this plague rather than blaming and generating antagonism against one another because, after all, we’re all in the same boat.
Facing the monumental challenge formed by COVID-19, cooperation is the only way to protect human rights. The wrong response to a pandemic will not only cause grave damage to people’s lives and livelihoods and countries’ health but also harm the world economy.
That’s why the world, more than ever, needs to act together to overcome this common threat.",5913
Coronavirus: WHO official denounces stigmatising language such as that used by Donald Trump: Top official decries Trump's choice of words that could stigmatise certain ethnic groups over coronavirus outbreak,"Churchill, Owen",Others,2020-03-20,"A top World Health Organisation (WHO) official on Wednesday condemned the use of language that could stigmatise certain ethnic groups over the coronavirus outbreak, as US President Donald Trump defended his adoption of the term ""Chinese virus"".
""It's really important that we be careful in the language we use lest it leads to profiling of individuals associated with the virus,"" said Mike Ryan, the head of the WHO's health emergency programmes. ""This is just something we need to all avoid.""
As the Covid-19 pandemic, which has claimed nearly 9,000 lives, swept through the world, verbal and physical attacks against ethnic Chinese people and others of East Asian descent have swelled.
On Tuesday, Weijia Jiang, a White House correspondent for CBS News, said an administration official had used the term ""Kung-Flu"" in front of her. ""I'm sure anyone would regret profiling a virus along an ethnic line,"" Ryan, who did not mention Trump by name, said on Wednesday.
Briefing reporters on Wednesday with updates in what he called his administration's ""war against the Chinese virus"", Trump was grilled by several journalists over whether such language could fuel rising xenophobic attacks against Asian-Americans.
""It's not racist at all, no,"" he said. ""It comes from China, that's why.""
Trump, who has repeatedly rejected any criticism of his administration's response to the Covid-19 outbreak, said that Asian-Americans ""would probably agree with [the term] 100 per cent"".
Such language, which contravenes WHO guidelines against the use of geographical terms in naming diseases, has elicited a wave of criticism from the US public, advocacy groups and lawmakers - including, contrary to Trump's estimations, Asian-Americans.
Congresswoman Judy Chu, a Democrat from California, secured a commitment last month from Trump's secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar, to refrain from calling it ""China coronavirus"".
""We must ensure that nobody is discriminated against based on ethnicity,"" Azar said during a US House hearing. ""Ethnicity is not what causes the coronavirus.""
Former US vice-president Joe Biden, who likely will be Trump's opponent in the November election, also criticised the president's continued use of the term ""Chinese virus"". ""Stop the xenophobic fearmongering. Be honest. Take responsibility. Do your job,"" Biden tweeted on Wednesday.
Trump had previously referred to the contagion as the ""coronavirus"" or ""the virus"", but that changed on Monday amid remarks by Chinese diplomats who, citing conspiracy theories, suggested that the contagion could have been brought to China by US soldiers competing in the Military World Games in Wuhan in October.
Trump said on Wednesday that such claims were unacceptable. ""That can't happen. It's not going to happen, not as long as I'm president."" The spat has intensified tensions between Washington and Beijing at a time when WHO officials are calling for a unified global response to the pandemic.
""This is a time for solidarity, this is a time for facts,"" Ryan said.
""All that we need now is to be able to identify the things we need to do to move forward quickly with speed, with certainty and to avoid any indication of ethnic or other associations of this virus.""
When asked on Wednesday about the purported usage of ""Kung-Flu"" by a White House official, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said that Jiang, the CBS reporter, should reveal the name of the official, who was not speaking on record. Deflecting further questioning over the alleged incident, she said: ""I'm married to an Asian.""
Later in the morning, George Conway - her husband and a fierce Trump critic - began sharing posts on Twitter linking to a Washington Post column he penned last year with the headline ""Trump is a racist president.""",3780
Neither 'Wuhan virus' nor 'Los Angeles virus',"Lun, Yan",Others,2020-03-13,"Is China trying to deny its ""disgraceful role"" in a ""global pandemic"" by strongly opposing the use of ""Wuhan virus"" or ""China virus"" to describe the novel coronavirus? And has China put the whole world on edge because of its inability to contain the virus in Wuhan, Hubei province, in the initial stages?
Yes, claim many Western media outlets and politicians.
But has the world heard of ""Los Angeles virus"" or ""US virus""?
In June 1981, a rare type of pneumonia was detected in five previously healthy young men in Los Angeles. Epidemiologists had to conduct studies for 18 months to identify the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and its major risk factors.
The lethal disease has spread from the United States to the rest of world in the past 39 years. According to UNAIDS, in 2018 an estimated 37.9 million people, including 1.7 million children, were living with HIV and 770,000 died of AIDS-related illnesses. And since the first cases were reported, a total of about 74.9 million people have contracted HIV and 32 million people have died of AIDS-related illnesses.
Has anyone used ""Los Angeles virus"" to describe HIV? Have people attacked the US for failing to keep the deadly disease within its borders? Do people panic over the disease that claimed 770,000 lives in 2018 alone?
The answers are no. It was in 2007, 26 years after the first AIDS cases were reported in Los Angeles, that biologists at the University of Arizona put forward a hypothesis that HIV was carried from Africa first to Haiti and then to the US way back in 1969.
Have people rejected the hypothesis, saying the US is trying to cover its ""role"" in ""creating and spreading"" HIV/AIDS?
No. On the contrary, the hypothesis has been widely accepted.
To determine where a new kind of disease or virus originated, scientists need a long time to track down the pathogen, ""patient zero"", or ""ground zero"". And even a century after the influenza pandemic of 1918-20, more widely known as ""Spanish flu"", killed about 40 million people, there are different hypotheses about its place of origin - from France to the US, to even China.
The opposition to linking the novel coronavirus with Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, is not China's attempt to shirk its responsibility as COVID-19 cases outside China continue to rise sharply, but because epidemiologists and other experts need time and arduous research to find out where it originated. In early February, in the initial stages of the outbreak, at least 12 people in Japan had contracted the disease despite not having a travel history to China or coming in contact with a Chinese national. And at the hearing in the US House of Representatives on Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield admitted that it was possible some Americans who appear to have died of influenza may actually have died of the novel coronavirus as the CDC's surveillance system for pneumonia does not cover every city, every state, every hospital.
The novel coronavirus is the common enemy of humankind. And people who have suffered and even lost their lives in the epidemic should not be blamed for that. Before the puzzle of determining the place of origin of the virus is solved, people shouldn't display their ignorance by casting aspersions on others, especially the victims. If some media outlets and politicians such as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo continue to link the virus with ""Wuhan"" or ""China"", they would be spreading racial hatred.
Take a look at the chain of discrimination that is emerging because of prejudice. In a recent column in The New York Times, a Chinese author described how a woman of Vietnamese origin in an Asian community in the US yelled at her for ""eating weird food and bringing it here"". Asians have become an eyesore for many Westerners now. A college student from Singapore was beaten up in London by a group of men who told him that they didn't ""want your coronavirus in my country"". Such biased attacks will undermine the joint efforts to fight the pandemic, and they should stop.
True, all 15 makeshift hospitals in Wuhan were closed on Tuesday, suggesting China is closer to reining in the outbreak. But let us not forget what China has sacrificed in the battle against the disease: the whole Hubei province is under lockdown, China's economic growth may slip to as low as 3.5 percent in the first quarter. Nor should we forget the contribution of more than 40,000 medical staff from across the country who went to Wuhan to take care of the patients. And the measures China has taken to control the epidemic will not only better protect its people, but has also created a window of opportunity for other countries to fight against the disease, as WHO said.
Indeed, China should learn many lessons from the anti-virus fight, including how to strengthen public health governance in the early stage of an outbreak. Such painful lessons, as well as experiences, are valuable reference for other countries tackling an epidemic.
Wuhan's sacrifices, Hubei's sufferings, China's battles. The stories of the city, the province, and the country should not be demonized. And calling the novel coronavirus ""Wuhan virus"" or ""China virus"" is the worst form of demonizing. It should stop.",5267
World: Human Rights Dimensions of COVID-19 Response,None,Others,2020-03-20,"On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that an outbreak of the viral disease COVID-19 - first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China - had reached the level of a global pandemic. Citing concerns with the alarming levels of spread and severity, the WHO called for governments to take urgent and aggressive action to stop the spread of the virus.
International human rights law guarantees everyone the right to the highest attainable standard of health and obligates governments to take steps to prevent threats to public health and to provide medical care to those who need it. Human rights law also recognizes that in the context of serious public health threats and public emergencies threatening the life of the nation, restrictions on some rights can be justified when they have a legal basis, are strictly necessary, based on scientific evidence and neither arbitrary nor discriminatory in application, of limited duration, respectful of human dignity, subject to review, and proportionate to achieve the objective.
The scale and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic clearly rises to the level of a public health threat that could justify restrictions on certain rights, such as those that result from the imposition of quarantine or isolation limiting freedom of movement. At the same time, careful attention to human rights such as non-discrimination and human rights principles such as transparency and respect for human dignity can foster an effective response amidst the turmoil and disruption that inevitably results in times of crisis and limit the harms that can come from the imposition of overly broad measures that do not meet the above criteria.
This document provides an overview of human rights concerns posed by the coronavirus outbreak, drawing on examples of government responses to date, and recommends ways governments and other actors can respect human rights in their response.

COVID-19
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a new coronavirus first identified in December 2019. Coronaviruses are a family of viruses known to cause respiratory infections. There is no vaccine yet to prevent COVID-19, and no specific treatment for it, other than managing the symptoms.
By mid-March 2020, more than 150 countries had reported cases of COVID-19, and the WHO reported there were more than 200,000 cases worldwide. More than 7,000 people had died and the numbers were continuing to rise at an alarming rate.
Applicable International Standards
Under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which most countries have adopted, everyone has the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Governments are obligated to take effective steps for the prevention, treatment and control of epidemic, endemic, occupational and other diseases.
The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which monitors state compliance with the covenant, has stated that:
The right to health is closely related to and dependent upon the realization of other human rights, as contained in the International Bill of Rights, including the rights to food, housing, work, education, human dignity, life, non-discrimination, equality, the prohibition against torture, privacy, access to information, and the freedoms of association, assembly and movement. These and other rights and freedoms address integral components of the right to health.
The right to health provides that health facilities, goods, and services should be:
available in sufficient quantity,
accessible to everyone without discrimination, and affordable for all, even marginalized groups; acceptable, meaning respectful of medical ethics and culturally appropriate; and
scientifically and medically appropriate and of good quality. The Siracusa Principles, adopted by the UN Economic and Social Council in 1984, and UN Human Rights Committee general comments on states of emergency and freedom of movement provide authoritative guidance on government responses that restrict human rights for reasons of public health or national emergency. Any measures taken to protect the population that limit people's rights and freedoms must be lawful, necessary, and proportionate. States of emergency need to be limited in duration and any curtailment of rights needs to take into consideration the disproportionate impact on specific populations or marginalized groups.
On March 16, 2020, a group of UN human rights experts said that emergency declarations based on the COVID-19 outbreak should not be used as a basis to target particular groups, minorities, or individuals. It should not function as a cover for repressive action under the guise of protecting health... and should not be used simply to quash dissent.
The Siracusa Principles specically state that restrictions should, at a minimum, be: provided for and carried out in accordance with the law;
directed toward a legitimate objective of general interest;
strictly necessary in a democratic society to achieve the objective;
the least intrusive and restrictive available to reach the objective;
based on scientic evidence and neither arbitrary nor discriminatory in application; and
of limited duration, respectful of human dignity, and subject to review. Human Rights Concerns Protect freedom of expression and ensure access to critical information
Under international human rights law, governments have an obligation to protect the right to freedom of expression, including the right to seek, receive, and impart information of all kinds, regardless of frontiers. Permissible restrictions on freedom of expression for reasons of public health, noted above, may not put in jeopardy the right itself.
Governments are responsible for providing information necessary for the protection and promotion of rights, including the right to health. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights regards as a core obligation providing education and access to information concerning the main health problems in the community, including methods of preventing and controlling them. A rights-respecting response to COVID-19 needs to ensure that accurate and up-to-date information about the virus, access to services, service disruptions, and other aspects of the response to the outbreak is readily available and accessible to all.
In a number of countries, governments have failed to uphold the right to freedom of expression, taking actions against journalists and healthcare workers. This ultimately limited effective communication about the onset of the disease and undermined trust in government actions:
China's government initially withheld basic information about the coronavirus from the public, underreported cases of infection, downplayed the severity of the infection, and dismissed the likelihood of transmission between humans. Authorities detained people for reporting on the epidemic on social media and internet users for rumor-mongering, censored online discussions of the epidemic, and curbed media reporting. In early January, Li Wenliang, a doctor at a hospital in Wuhan where infected patients were being treated, was summoned by police for spreading rumors after he warned of the new virus in an online chatroom. He died in early February from the virus.
In Iran, the outbreak emerged after authorities had severely damaged public trust by brutally repressing widespread anti-government protests and lying about shooting down a civilian airliner. As a result, Iranian authorities have struggled to assure the public that government decision-making around the COVID-19 outbreak has been in the public's best interests. The unusually high rate of reported cases of government officials contracting the virus, as well as the inconsistency in figures announced by officials and domestic media sources, have heightened concerns that the data is either being deliberately underreported or poorly collected and analyzed.
In Thailand, whistleblowers in the public health sector and online journalists have faced retaliatory lawsuits and intimidation from authorities after they criticized government responses to the outbreak, raised concerns about a possible cover-up, and reported alleged corruption related to the hoarding and profiteering of surgical masks and other supplies. Some medical personnel were also threatened with disciplinary action - including termination of employment contracts and revocation of their licenses - for speaking out about the severe shortage of essential supplies in hospitals across the country.
A few countries prioritized open communication and transparent reporting on the number of cases:
Taiwan took swift steps to combat the virus, including promptly making credible information widely available to the public. Daily press briefings by health officials and public service announcements aim to counter misinformation and have helped to calm panic, restore public confidence, and encourage people's assistance in the crisis.
Singapore's government published and regularly updated detailed statistics on the number and rate of infections and recoveries.
South Korea's government also published health data and health officials gave two daily briefings to establish public confidence and promote citizen vigilance.
In Italy, inconsistent messages from public officials, including for domestic political reasons, may initially have diluted the impact of public service announcements about proper hygiene and social distancing. The government has held daily news conferences to share data and implemented an aggressive public campaign about better practices to protect oneself and others from spreading the virus.
Recommendations:
Governments should fully respect the rights to freedom of expression and access to information, and only restrict them as international standards permit.
Governments should ensure that the information they provide to the public regarding COVID-19 is accurate, timely, and consistent with human rights principles. This is important for addressing false and misleading information.
All information about COVID-19 should be accessible and available in multiple languages, including for those with low or no literacy. This should include qualified sign language interpretation for televised announcements, as Taiwan has done; websites that are accessible to people with vision, hearing, learning, and other disabilities; and telephone-based services that have text capabilities for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Communications should utilize plain language to maximize understanding. Age appropriate information should be provided to children to help them take steps to protect themselves.
Health data is particularly sensitive, and the publication of information online can pose a significant risk to affected persons and in particular people who are already in positions of vulnerability or marginalization in society. Rights-based legal safeguards should govern the appropriate use and handling of personal health data.
Reliable and unfettered access to the internet should be maintained and steps should be taken to ensure internet access be available to people with low incomes. The US Federal Communications Commission's Keep Americans Connected pledge commits participating companies not to terminate service to customers who are unable to pay their bills due to the disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, to waive any late fees, and to open Wi-Fi hotspots to any American who needs them. Further steps could be taken to lift data caps, upgrade speeds, and eliminate eligibility requirements for any low-income targeted plans during the pandemic.
Ensure quarantines, lockdowns, and travel bans comply with rights norms
International human rights law, notably the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), requires that restrictions on rights for reasons of public health or national emergency be lawful, necessary, and proportionate. Restrictions such as mandatory quarantine or isolation of symptomatic people must, at a minimum, be carried out in accordance with the law. They must be strictly necessary to achieve a legitimate objective, based on scientific evidence, proportionate to achieve that objective, neither arbitrary nor discriminatory in application, of limited duration, respectful of human dignity, and subject to review.
Broad quarantines and lockdowns of indeterminate length rarely meet these criteria and are often imposed precipitously, without ensuring the protection of those under quarantine - especially at-risk populations. Because such quarantines and lockdowns are difficult to impose and enforce uniformly, they are often arbitrary or discriminatory in application.
Freedom of movement under international human rights law protects, in principle, the right of everyone to leave any country, to enter their own country of nationality, and the right of everyone lawfully in a country to move freely in the whole territory of the country. Restrictions on these rights can only be imposed when lawful, for a legitimate purpose, and when the restrictions are proportionate, including in considering their impact. Travel bans and restrictions on freedom of movement may not be discriminatory nor have the effect of denying people the right to seek asylum or of violating the absolute ban on being returned to where they face persecution or torture.
Governments have broad authority under international law to ban visitors and migrants from other countries. However, domestic and international travel bans historically have often had limited effectiveness in preventing transmission, and may in fact accelerate disease spread if people flee from quarantine zones prior to their imposition.
In China, the government imposed an overly broad quarantine with little respect for rights:
In mid-January, authorities in China quarantined close to 60 million people in two days in an effort to limit transmission from the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, where the virus was first reported, even though by the time the quarantine started, 5 million of Wuhan's 11 million residents had left the city. Many residents in cities under quarantine expressed difficulties obtaining medical care and other life necessities, and chilling stories have emerged of deaths and illnesses: A boy with cerebral palsy died because no one took care of him after his father was taken to be quarantined. A woman with leukemia died after being turned away by several hospitals because of concerns about cross-infection. A mother desperately pleaded to the police to let her daughter with leukemia through a checkpoint at a bridge to get chemotherapy. A man with kidney disease jumped to his death from his apartment balcony after he couldn't get access to health facilities for dialysis. Authorities have also reportedly used various intrusive containment measures: barricading shut the doors of suspected infected families with metal poles, arresting people for refusing to wear masks, and flying drones with loudspeakers to scold people who went outside without masks. The authorities did little to combat discrimination against people from Wuhan or Hubei province who traveled elsewhere in China.
In Italy the government has imposed a lockdown but with greater protections for individual rights. The Italian government adopted progressively restrictive measures since the first major outbreak of COVID-19 cases in the country in late February. Authorities initially placed ten towns in Lombardy and one in Veneto under strict quarantine, prohibiting residents from leaving the areas. At the same time, they closed schools in affected regions. Citing a surge in cases and an increasingly unsustainable burden on the public healthcare system, the government on March 8 imposed a slew of new measures on much of the country's north that put in place much more severe restrictions on movement and basic freedoms. The next day, the measures were applied across the country. Further measures imposed included restrictions on travel except for essential work or health reasons (upon self- certification), closure of all cultural centers (cinemas, museums), and cancellation of sports events and public gatherings. On March 11 the government closed all bars, restaurants, and stores except food markets and pharmacies (and a few other exceptions) across the country. People who disobey the travel restrictions without a valid reason can be fined up to 206 euros and face a three-month prison term. All schools and universities were closed throughout the country. People have been allowed out to shop for essential items, exercise, work (if unable to perform work from home), and for health reasons (including care for a sick relative).
Other governments, such as those in South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore have responded to the outbreak without enacting sweeping restrictions on personal liberty, but have reduced the number of travelers from other countries with significant outbreaks. In South Korea, the government adopted proactive and ramped-up testing for COVID-19. It focused on identifying infection hotspots, conducting a large number of tests on at-risk people without charge, disinfecting streets in areas with high numbers of infections, setting up drive-through testing centers, and promoting social distancing. In Hong Kong, there have been concerted efforts to promote social distancing, handwashing, and mask-wearing. Taiwan proactively identified patients who sought health care for symptoms of respiratory illness and had some tested for COVID-19. It also set up a system that alerts the authorities based on travel history and symptoms during clinical visits to aid in case identification and monitoring. Singapore adopted a contact-tracing program for those confirmed to have the virus, among other measures. However, the government's decision to deport four foreign workers for violating a mandatory 14-day leave of absence from work and ban them from working in the country raises concern of disproportionate penalties.
Recommendations:
Governments should avoid sweeping and overly broad restrictions on movement and personal liberty, and only move towards mandatory restrictions when scientifically warranted and necessary and when mechanisms for support of those affected can be ensured. A letter from more than 800 public health and legal experts in the US stated, Voluntary self-isolation measures [combined with education, widespread screening, and universal access to treatment] are more likely to induce cooperation and protect public trust than coercive measures and are more likely to prevent attempts to avoid contact with the healthcare system.
When quarantines or lockdowns are imposed, governments are obligated to ensure access to food, water, health care, and care-giving support. Many older people and people with disabilities rely on uninterrupted home and community services and support. Ensuring continuity of these services and operations means that public agencies, community organizations, health care providers, and other essential service providers are able to continue performing essential functions to meet the needs of older people and people with disabilities. Government strategies should minimize disruption in services and develop contingent sources of comparable services. Disruption of community-based services can result in the institutionalization of persons with disabilities and older people, which can lead to negative health outcomes, including death, as discussed below.
Protect people in custody and in institutions
COVID-19, like other infectious diseases, poses a higher risk to populations that live in close proximity to each other. And it disproportionately affects older people and individuals with underlying illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and hypertension. Eighty percent of the people who have died of COVID-19 in China were over the age of 60.
This risk is particularly acute in places of detention, such as prisons, jails, and immigration detention centers, as well as residential institutions for people with disabilities and nursing facilities for older people, where the virus can spread rapidly, especially if access to health care is already poor. States have an obligation to ensure medical care for those in their custody at least equivalent to that available to the general population, and must not deny or limit detainees, including asylum seekers or undocumented migrants, equal access to preventive, curative or palliative health care. Asylum seekers, refugees living in camps, and people experiencing homelessness may also be at increased risk because of their lack of access to adequate water and hygiene facilities.
In nursing facilities and other settings with large numbers of older people, visitor policies should balance the protection of older and at-risk residents with their need for family and connection. The US Department of Veterans Affairs announced a no visitors policy at its 134 nursing homes around the country in response to the risk of COVID-19. While the risk to older people is serious, blanket policies do not take into account public health guidance or the needs of older people.
People in prisons, jails, and immigration detention centers frequently do not receive adequate health care under normal circumstances, even in economically developed countries. Severely substandard health care has contributed to recent deaths of immigrants in the custody of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Populations in custody often include older people and people with serious chronic health conditions, meaning they are at greater risk for illness from COVID-19.
Many people in US jails have not been convicted of a crime but are locked up simply because they cannot afford to pay the bail set in their case. Older men and women are the fastest growing group in US prisons due to lengthy sentences, and prison officials already have difficulty providing them appropriate medical care. As a response, in one county in the US state of Ohio, the courts expedited review of people in jail, releasing some and transferring others to prisons. The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit that seeks to challenge ongoing immigrant detention in the context of the virus.
Prisoners in Iran have reportedly tested positive for the coronavirus, including in Evin prison in Tehran and in the cities of Euromieh and Rasht. In an open letter in February, families of 25 prisoners detained for peaceful activism sought their at least temporary release amid the outbreak and lack of sufficient prison medical care. In March, the Iranian judiciary 1⁄4Դ3⁄4ÅҴ! ¡ÒÃÍéҧÍԧ¡ÒÃàa×èÍÁâ§ËÅÒÂÁԵÔäÁè¶١μéͧ about 85,000 prisoners for the Persian New Year (Nowruz), a substantially greater number than normal for the holiday, apparently because of health concerns surrounding the coronavirus outbreak. However, dozens of human rights defenders and others held on vaguely defined national security crimes remained in prison.
On March 12, Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa reportedly pardoned 901 detainees for humanitarian reasons, in the backdrop of the current circumstances, likely in reference to the coronavirus outbreak. The Ministry of Interior announced that another 585 detainees would be released and granted non-custodial sentences.
In Italy, prisoners in over 40 prisons have protested over fears of contagion in overcrowded facilities and against bans on family visits and supervised release during the coronavirus pandemic. In response, authorities have authorized for the first time the use of email and Skype for contact between prisoners and their families and for educational purposes and announced a plan to release and place under house arrest prisoners with less than 18 months on their sentence. The main prisoner rights organization in Italy, Antigone, estimated this could benefit at most 3,000 prisoners, while the penitentiary system is at around 14,000 over capacity. The organization called for broader measures to ensure the release of a greater number of detainees, including in particular older detainees and those with at-risk health profiles, among other measures. Civil society organizations have also called for alternatives to detention for all people currently detained in immigration detention centers in Italy due to the increased risk of infection and no prospect for deportation.
Recommendations:
Government agencies with authority over people housed in prisons, jails, and immigration detention centers should consider reducing their populations through appropriate supervised or early release of low-risk category of detainees including for example, those whose scheduled release may be soon, those who are in pre-trial detention for non-violent and lesser offenses, or whose continued detention is similarly unnecessary or not justified. Detained individuals at high risk of suffering serious effects from the virus, such as older people and people with underlying health conditions, should also be considered for similar release with regard to whether the detention facility has the capacity to protect their health, including guaranteed access to treatment, and taking into consideration factors such as the gravity of the crime committed and time served.
If safe and legal deportations are suspended due to the virus, the legal justification for detaining people pending deportation may no longer exist. In these cases, authorities should release detainees and institute alternatives to detention.
Authorities that operate prisons, jails, and immigration detention centers should publicly disclose their plans of action to reduce the risk of coronavirus infection in their facilities and the steps they will take to contain the infection and protect prisoners, prison staff, and visitors, if cases of the virus or exposure to it are present. Persons in any form of detention have the same right to health as the non-incarcerated population and are entitled to the same standards of prevention and treatment. The detained population and the general population have a compelling interest to know in advance what plans authorities have put in place for handling COVID-19.
Authorities should take steps to ensure they are appropriately coordinating with public health departments and communicating openly with staff and people in custody. They should also screen and test for COVID-19 according to the most recent recommendations of health authorities. They should provide appropriate hygiene training and supplies and ensure that all areas susceptible to harboring the virus and accessible to prisoners, prison staff, and visitors, are disinfected regularly, consistent with accepted best practices. They should develop plans for housing people exposed to or infected with the virus. They should ensure that individuals released or put on supervised leave have access to appropriate accommodations and health care. Any plans for lockdowns or isolation should be limited in scope and duration based on the best science available, and they should not be or seem punitive, as fear of being placed in lockdowns or isolation could delay people notifying medical staff if they experience symptoms of infection. Detention centers should consider alternative strategies such as video conferencing for individuals to be able to connect with family or legal counsel.
Governments seeking to contain the spread of the virus should evaluate and modify as necessary during the time of the outbreak measures used to enforce immigration laws, including court hearings and check-ins with authorities as alternatives to detention. Authorities should provide public notice
that there will be no negative repercussions for missed court dates or check-ins during the time of the outbreak. Authorities should stop arbitrary detentions of migrants, seek alternatives to detention for people currently in immigration detention, and opt for release where possible, particularly for those in high-risk categories if infected and for people who are being held with no prospect for imminent, safe, and legal deportation.
In the absence of adequate state support, the United Nations and other inter-governmental agencies should urgently press for access to formal and informal detention facilities to provide detainees with life-saving assistance.
Governments housing refugees and asylum seekers should ensure their response to COVID-19 includes prevention and treatment measures, with particular attention to measures to alleviate overcrowding in detention centers and camps, improve sanitation and access to health care, and resort to time-bound quarantines and isolation only as necessary.
Ensure protection of health workers
As part of the right to health, the ICESCR provides that governments should create conditions that would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness.
Governments have an obligation to minimize the risk of occupational accidents and diseases including by ensuring workers have health information and adequate protective clothing and equipment. This means providing health workers and others involved in the COVID-19 response with appropriate training in infection control and with appropriate protective gear.
Combating the spread of COVID-19 requires that health facilities have adequate water, sanitation, hygiene, healthcare waste management, and cleaning. A 2019 baseline report by WHO and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) found that [a]n estimated 896 million people use health care facilities with no water service and 1.5 billion use facilities with no sanitation service.
Human Rights Watch research into hospital-acquired infections in Hungary suggests the nation's mismanaged, underfunded, and understaffed public healthcare system is poorly equipped to handle a COVID-19 outbreak. Patients and medical experts described a lack of basic hygiene protocol, lack of isolation rooms, and a shortage of health professionals, doctors and nurses, and medical supplies in general. One doctor said it was nearly impossible to get essential items like disinfectant and respirator masks, which are critical to protect against viruses.
In Venezuela, Human Rights Watch has documented a health system in utter collapse. Hospitals have closed or are operating at a fraction of their capacity, many without regular access to electricity or water. Vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and diphtheria have returned long before the pandemic hit.
Broad sanctions imposed by the US on Iran have drastically constrained the ability of the country to finance humanitarian imports, including medicines. This has caused serious hardships for ordinary Iranians. Concerned governments should support Iran's efforts to combat the COVID-19, including by providing access to medical devices and testing kits.
In Thailand, public health capacity has been diminished by corruption. Medical personnel lack surgical masks and local supplies have been diverted and shipped to China and other markets in part due to corruption.
The Health Ministry in Egypt in February sent doctors and medical teams to a quarantine facility without informing them that their transfer was part of the COVID-19 response or of the risks entailed. Medical staff said they were tricked into the assignment.
In Lebanon, the spokesperson for the country's medical supply importers told Human Rights Watch that the country had run out of gloves, masks, gowns, and other supplies necessary to deal with the coronavirus outbreak due to the financial crisis that had prevented them from importing needed goods. She added that medical supply importers have brought in just US$10 million of the $120 million in goods they have sought since October and nearly all transactions have been frozen since February due to the country's ongoing economic crisis. The head of the Syndicate of Private Hospitals said that the government owes private hospitals more than $1.3 billion, compromising their ability to pay staff and purchase medical equipment. Yet the Lebanese government has not put in place any measures to address the economic crisis threatening access to medical care, medicine, and medical equipment.
Recommendations:
Governments should take measures so that health care is available to all, accessible without discrimination, affordable, respectful of medical ethics, culturally appropriate, and of good quality.
Governments should ensure that health workers have access to appropriate protective equipment and that social protection programs are in place for the families of workers who die or become ill as a result of their work, and ensure such programs include informal workers, who represent a large share of the caregiving sector.
In past epidemics, fear of exposure has led to attacks on health workers. Governments should monitor for such attacks to deter them, and ensure that they can quickly, adequately, and appropriately respond if attacks occur.
Fulfill the right to education-even if schools are temporarily closed
Many countries have closed schools since the COVID-19 outbreak, disrupting the learning and education of hundreds of millions of students. In times of crises, schools provide children with a sense of stability and normalcy and ensure children have a routine and are emotionally supported to cope with a changing situation. Schools also provide important spaces for children and their families to learn about hygiene, appropriate handwashing techniques, and coping with situations that will break routines. Without access to schools, this prime responsibility falls on parents, guardians, and caregivers. When schools are closed, government agencies should step in to provide clear and accurate public health information through appropriate media.
To ensure education systems respond adequately, UNESCO has recommended that states adopt a variety of hi-tech, low-tech and no tech solutions to assure the continuity of learning. In many countries, teachers already use online learning platforms to complement normal contact hours in classrooms for homework, classroom exercises, and research, and many students have access to technological equipment at home. However, not all countries, communities, families, or social groups have adequate internet access, and many children live in places with frequent government-led internet shutdowns.
Recommendations:
Online learning should be used to mitigate the immediate impact of lost normal school time. Schools deploying educational technology for online learning should ensure the tools protect child rights and privacy. Governments should attempt to recover missed in-person class time once schools reopen.
Governments should adopt measures to mitigate the disproportionate effects on children who already experience barriers to education, or who are marginalized for various reasons - including girls, those with disabilities, those affected by their location, their family situation, and other inequalities. Governments should focus on adopting strategies that support all students through closures - for example, monitoring students most at risk and ensuring students receive printed or online materials on time, with particular attention provided to students with disabilities who may require adapted, accessible material.
Governments should adopt mitigation strategies, for example by working with teachers, school officials, and teachers' unions and associations to factor in plans to recover teaching or contact hours lost, adjusting school calendars and exam schedules, and ensuring fair compensation for teachers and school personnel who are working additional hours.
In countries with high numbers of out-of-school children, school closures may jeopardize efforts to increase school enrollments and retention, particularly at the secondary level. Governments should place additional measures to monitor compliance with compulsory education - and ensure government education officials monitor school returns once schools reopen. Education officials should focus attention on areas with high incidence of child labor or child marriage and ensure all children return to school. Officials should also ensure that schools with refugee students adopt outreach measures to ensure refugee children return to school, including by working with refugee parent groups and community leaders.
Sudden school closures may also leave low-income families struggling to make ends meet and provide necessities. Governments should guarantee continued meal provision during school closures for children in low-income families who will miss subsidized meals.
Address disproportionate impacts on women and girls
Outbreaks of disease often have gendered impacts. Human Rights Watch found that the 2014 Ebola virus disease outbreak and the 2015-2016 outbreak of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in Brazil had particularly harmful impacts on women and girls and reinforced longstanding gender inequity. News reports and public health analysis suggest that COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting women in a number of ways.
Though risks specific to pregnant women exposed to COVID-19 are not yet clear, the outbreak could negatively affect sexual and reproductive health and rights. Overloaded health systems, reallocation of resources, shortages of medical supplies, and disruptions of global supply chains could harm women's access to contraception and pre- and post-natal and birth care. Although the risk of infection through breastfeeding is not known, the UN Population Fund has recommended that breastfeeding mothers who become ill should not be separated from their infants. Past epidemics, such as the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, have impacted the availability of routine prenatal and maternity care, leaving women more at risk to preventable maternal deaths or morbidities.
In China, press reports suggest an increase in domestic violence under quarantine. Crises - and lockdowns - can trigger greater incidence of domestic violence for reasons including increased stress, cramped and difficult living conditions, and breakdowns in community support mechanisms. Crises can often further limit women's ability to get away from abuse, and place victims in an environment without appropriate access to services, such as safe shelter away from abusers and accountability for abuse.
Women globally do almost 2.5 times as much unpaid care and domestic work as men, and they are more likely than men to face additional care giving responsibilities when schools close, making it harder to maintain paid employment. Japan responded to the potential for a disproportionate impact on families with young children by offering to offset costs to businesses for workers taking paid leave to care for children during school closures, though the amount offered was low. Italy was considering measures to mitigate the effects of the lockdown on families with children. These could include emergency paid parental leave or vouchers for families with children up to 12 years old (or children with disabilities without any age limit) who need to pay for childcare amid the prolonged school closures.
Up to 95 percent of female workers in some regions work in the informal sector where there is no job security, and no safety net if a crisis like COVID-19 destroys their earnings. Informal work includes many occupations most likely to be harmed by a quarantine, social distancing, and economic slowdown, such as street vendors, goods traders, and seasonal workers. Women are also over-represented in service industries that have been among the hardest hit by the response to COVID-19.
Worldwide, 70 percent of health and social service providers are women - meaning women are at the front lines of containing the spread of COVID-19 and may be heavily exposed to the virus through work in the health sector. Fear in communities about the exposure that health workers face may lead women in this sector to be shunned or face stigma, adding an extra burden to the challenge of trying to protect their and their families' health. This may manifest itself, for example, in trying to access or secure childcare while they work on the front lines.
Some female care workers are migrant domestic workers. They can be vulnerable to abusive employment conditions in normal times, and are at heightened risk of abuse, losing employment, being frontline caregivers without adequate protections, and of being trapped and unable to reach their homes during a crisis. They may also face barriers to protecting their own health.
Moves toward telecommuting - for school and work - as a means of social distancing can disproportionately harm women and girls. Women are up to 31 percent less likely to have internet access than men in some countries, and worldwide about 327 million fewer women than men have a smartphone.
Even when women have access to the internet, gender disparities may make them less able to use it for reasons including cost, socialization, and family pressures. When multiple members of a household need access to limited computing resources within the home, gender inequality may mean women and girls have less access.
Recommendations:
Authorities should take steps to mitigate gendered impacts and ensure that responses do not perpetuate gender inequity.
When education is moved online, governments and education providers should monitor participation and retention of students in online courses for a gendered impact and respond quickly with strategies to retain and reengage women and girls if their participation falls off. They should also address the particular risks of job losses to women who may take on additional caregiving during school closures.
Measures designed to assist workers affected by the pandemic should ensure the assistance of workers in informal work and service industries, who are predominantly women.
Governments should ensure public awareness campaigns address how victims of domestic violence can access services, and should ensure that services are available to all victims of domestic violence, including those living in areas under movement restrictions or under quarantine and those infected with COVID-19.
Governments should support frontline health and social service care workers with the recognition that these workers are mostly women. Support should include consideration of their needs as caregivers within their own families and the impact of stigma on them and their families.
Both source and destination countries for migrant domestic workers should adopt special measures to locate and assist migrant domestic workers to prevent abusive labor conditions and provide assistance relating to managing COVID-19.
Governments and international bodies should closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women and act to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the right of women and girls to access sexual and reproductive health services.
Root out discrimination and stigma, protect patient confidentiality
During previous public health crises, people with infection or disease and their families have often faced discrimination and stigma. For example, Human Rights Watch found that people living with HIV in Kenya, South Africa, the Philippines, and the US faced discrimination and stigma due to their HIV status and have been prevented from accessing health care, getting jobs, and attending school. Public health research has shown that survivors of Ebola in West Africa have faced harmful stigma that, in some cases, has led to eviction, loss of employment, abandonment, violence, and other consequences.
Since the coronavirus outbreak, news reports from a number of countries have documented bias, racism, xenophobia, and discrimination against people of Asian descent. Incidents include physical attacks and beatings, violent bullying in schools, angry threats, discrimination at school or in workplaces, and the use of derogatory language in news reports and on social media platforms, among others. Since January, media have reported alarming incidents of hate crimes in the United Kingdom, the US, Spain, and Italy, among other countries, targeting people of Asian descent, apparently linked to COVID-19. Senior US government officials, including President Donald Trump, have stoked anti-Chinese sentiment by referring to the coronavirus as the Chinese Virus, and in one incident reported by a White House correspondent, the Kung Flu. Anti-immigrant leaders like Victor Orban in Hungary and Matteo Salvini in Italy have seized on the pandemic to stoke xenophobic sentiment.
South Korean authorities believe 63 percent of the then more than 7,300 confirmed cases in the country attended services held by the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the city of Daegu or had contact with attendees. In a statement, the church reported 4,000 cases of injustice against congregants since the outbreak, including termination of employment, workplace bullying, domestic persecution, labeling, and slandering, and said the church was being blamed as the main culprit of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Reporting by the BBC in South Korea found that public health alerts around the virus may not have adequately protected the privacy of individuals with the virus.
Governments should take swift action to protect from attack individuals and communities who may be targeted as bearing responsibility for COVID-19, thoroughly investigate all reported incidents, and hold perpetrators accountable.
Governments should ensure that response measures to COVID-19 do not target or discriminate against particular religious or ethnic groups, and that responses are inclusive of and respect the rights of marginalized groups, including people with disabilities and older people. Governments should ensure equal access to emergency services to people with disabilities and older people.
Governments should work to combat stigma and discrimination by training health workers on COVID-19, using mass media and school networks to expand public awareness of human rights, and recognizing that the virus knows no boundaries and recognizes no distinctions of race, ethnicity, religion, or nationality.
Governments should ensure that patient confidentiality is protected even as authorities take steps to identify those who may have been exposed to the virus.
Ensure marginalized populations can access health care without discrimination
The UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, a pediatrician by training, has said that [t]o effectively combat the outbreak means ensuring everyone has access to treatment, and is not denied health care because they cannot pay for it or because of stigma.
In many countries, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people face discrimination in accessing health care. Human Rights Watch has documented health care discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in countries including the US, Tanzania, Japan, Indonesia,
Bangladesh, Russia, and Lebanon. Because some LGBT people, including men who have sex with men and transgender people, are at particularly high risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV and may be less likely to have access to testing and treatment than other populations, they may have compromised immunities and be particularly at risk of suffering serious illness or death as a result of COVID-19.
Governments should ensure that all healthcare services related to COVID-19 are provided without stigma and discrimination of any kind, including on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, and should make clear through public messaging campaigns that everyone has the right to access health care.
Governments should take steps to create firewalls between healthcare providers and undocumented migrants to reassure vulnerable populations that they do not risk reprisal or deportation if they access lifesaving care, especially in the context of seeking testing or treatment for COVID-19.
Governments should also ensure that financial barriers do not prevent people from accessing testing, preventative care, and treatment for COVID-19. In the US, 28 million people do not have medical insurance and nearly a third of the country have difficulty affording payments for treatment even though they are insured. Many people in the US report avoiding medical care or buying prescription medication because of cost, resulting in their condition worsening. In an epidemic, avoidance of medical care not only harms those with the illness but also could lead to increased spread of coronavirus.
All governments have an obligation to ensure that a serious public health crisis does not also become a human rights crisis because people are unable to access adequate medical care. Governments need to take steps to ensure everyone has affordable and accessible medical care and treatment options.
Protect community and civil society organizations
In many countries, civil society organizations are doing critical work to support efforts to stem the spread of the virus and ensure that those with COVID- 19 - or those living in isolation or under quarantine - have access to needed protection, care, and social services. Governments should protect and support civil society organizations doing this work, as well as those reporting on the impacts of the outbreak.
During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, nongovernmental groups, local newspapers, and community radio played a key role in public health education.
In Hong Kong, ordinary people have organized themselves to create and distribute masks and hand sanitizers to the most vulnerable to fill policy gaps. But the Chinese government has long maintained a stranglehold on nongovernmental organizations and some groups are struggling with reduced funding during the outbreak.
In Italy, authorities have subjected nongovernment sea rescue organizations assisting migrants and asylum seekers to quarantines at dock despite crew members and passengers testing negative for the virus. In a context in which civilian rescue missions have been consistently undermined, blocked, and even criminalized, potentially unnecessary quarantines might be used to deter rescue at sea.
Governments should not exploit the coronavirus pandemic to criminalize or obstruct the work of civil society organizations.
Promote the rights to water and sanitation
The rights to water and to sanitation are part of the right to an adequate standard of living. The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has reaffirmed that the rights to water and sanitation are an essential component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and integrally related, among other Covenant rights, to the right to health.
Billions of people around the world do not have access to safe drinking water. Yet, as the WHO has noted the provision of safe water, sanitation, and hygienic conditions is essential to protecting human health during the COVID-19 outbreak. Prevention of human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 virus may be supported by promotion of the rights to water and sanitation, and supporting water and wastewater infrastructure and technicians to ensure good and consistently applied water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and waste management practices in communities, homes, schools, marketplaces, and healthcare facilities. More research is needed to understand the risk of contaminated drinking water, environmental transmission, and how to ensure wastewater operators are trained and supported throughout the crisis.
Lack of potable water and sanitation at home, school, or in healthcare settings will make preventative measures difficult. In some cases, without adequate water and sanitation these settings themselves may be a locus for the spread of the disease.
Venezuela's healthcare infrastructure is so weak that the most basic recommendation -handwashing - is difficult even for healthcare providers, who work under difficult conditions. The Venezuelan doctors and nurses Human Rights Watch interviewed over the past few months said that soap and disinfectants were virtually nonexistent in their clinics and hospitals. As inflation has risen and salaries have been devalued, it has become impossible for them to bring in their own supplies. Public hospitals in Caracas, the capital, are also suffering regular water shortages. In remote hospitals, the shortages have lasted weeks to months. Patients and personnel have been required to bring their own water for drinking and sometimes for flushing toilets.
Governments should immediately suspend any water shutoffs for failure to pay. Discontinuing water services for failure to pay in any context is incompatible with human rights and can be particularly harmful in the context of public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ensure humanitarian aid continues
According to the United Nations, a number of the many countries affected by COVID-19 are already facing crises due to conflicts, natural disasters, or climate change. Many people in those crisis-hit countries rely on humanitarian aid to survive.
Governments should ensure that support for vital humanitarian operations carried out by the UN and other aid agencies does not suffer as a result of COVID-19.
Target economic relief to assist low-wage workers
Governments should take policy measures to buffer the economic impacts of COVID-19, which will affect lower-wage workers first and hardest. Social distancing, quarantine, and the closure of businesses may have enormous economic consequences. The most vulnerable people are low-wage workers in low-income households. Governments should create mechanisms so that workers affected by COVID-19 do not suffer loss of income that might deter them from self-isolating to contain the spread of the virus.
Public health experts recommend that companies encourage employees to work from home to prevent the virus from spreading. But remote work is not an option for millions of workers in fields like retail, restaurants, personal services, the gig economy, and informal sectors. In these fields, employment situations are more precarious, wages tend to be lower, and in some countries workers have low rates of paid sick leave. Particularly in countries such as the US, where low pay may combine with lack of access to sick leave and healthcare coverage, these workers will need assistance.
Human Rights Watch has long urged governments to guarantee paid sick and family leave to enable workers to take time off to care for new children or ill or older family members or to deal with their own serious health conditions without losing pay. In the context of COVID-19 and other disease outbreaks, paid sick and family leave helps ensure workers who are sick - or those with sick family members - can stay home to minimize the spread of the virus.
Many governments guarantee some paid sick leave to all workers. Others - most notably the US among developed economies - do not. Low-wage earners, service workers, informal workers, and workers in the gig economy are among those least likely to have paid sick leave. The lack of paid sick and family leave means disease outbreaks like COVID-19 place an undue burden on poor and marginalized workers and exacerbate economic inequality and also contribute to gender inequity. To support families during the outbreak, sick and family leave should cover self-isolation and caregiving responsibilities during school and care facility closures.
Global supply chains have already been disrupted by COVID-19, which has led to reduced manufacturing and factory closures. There is a risk that workers in jobs linked to the global economy will be forced to work part-time for less income or lose their jobs altogether.
One option is direct cash payments to compensate some lost working hours, as was provided by the US government during the 2008 recession. Low- wage workers need protection against the consequences of being let go by employers when they cannot work due to their sickness or the sickness of family members. Without assistance, these workers may face intense economic hardship, fall behind on debt payments, and risk eviction. Simple one-off cash grants to families whose children receive free school meals or who are in receipt of specific family-related social security assistance could also help mitigate impacts on already-struggling families who now in addition to loss of income could face extra burdens, for example, due to school closures. European countries, including Italy, France, and Spain, are considering or already adopted special financial measures to support workers, low-income families, and small businesses.
Unconditional tax cuts for employers and employee-side payroll tax cuts are often poorly targeted and may not reach those most in need. For example, expanded social insurance programs like unemployment may permit workers to stay on payroll and be paid when they cannot work because of a COVID- 19 downturn.",57872
Trump hints lockdown could end after 15 days [Times Global],Chidanand Rajghatta,Others,2020-03-24,"The US lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic could begin to draw to a close at the end of the 15-day shutdown this coming weekend, President Trump indicated on Monday, as the cost of the exercise the world is embracing is also decimating the national and global economy.
In all-caps, the US president tweeted: ""WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!"" He retweeted his own tweet, suggesting that he is aligning with the argument than an indefinite or even a long-drawn lockdown could hurt the world economy for a long time, causing more damage than the virus.
The tweet is seen as a pointer to what could be a gradual removal of restriction with a range of new protocols in place, unless there is an exponentially dramatic and continued surge in infections. Health officials are suggesting that the thermometre gun could become even more ubiquitous than the metal detector security wand, and social distancing, including the end of body contact gestures such as handshakes, could become the norm.
""I will bring it up at the next task force meeting and see whether there's some sort of a logistical, bureaucratic reason why it can't be done. The rationale for doing it is at least worth serious consideration,"" Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said in an interview to Science magazine about instituting temperature checks. Already, China and Italy have instituted such checks at most public places, including supermarkets.
While the logistics seem daunting, experts say the technology challenges are fairly easy to overcome; eventually, the same metal detectors at security checkpoints could also be engineered to measure temperature. The danger though is of freelance vigilantism and stigmatisation that is already surfacing across the world.
Aside from an uptick in xenophobia that has put people of East Asian origin in the crosshairs, even US citizens who are self-reporting cases of Covid-19 are being viewed with fear and subjected to harassment. An Indian-American mother of two kids in the Greater Washington area who reported her two high-school children testing Covid-19 positive and alerted her friends to it on social media subsequently deleted her post after the school principal demanded she remove it, ostensibly because it is causing panic in the school. While many friends lauded her courage in alerting the community, others peppered her with questions about how and where her kids contracted it, how and where they were tested, symptoms etc. She did not want to be named because of the amount of harassment she is facing.
Meanwhile, the US president latest thinking on easing the lockdown at the end of the 15-day isolation came even as he admitted he was a ""little upset"" with over its late sharing of information on coronavirus. ""They should have told us about this,"" he told reporters at a Sunday White House briefing. ""I'm a little upset with China. I'll be honest with you, because as much as I like President Xi (Jinping) and as much as I respect and admire the country.""
US lawmakers, meantime, are struggling to come up with stimulus package, with Democrats blocking it because they say it favours corporations rather than workers. The situation is also complicated by many lawmakers going into selfisolation. The spouse of Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar has been diagnosed with Covid-19 infection in addition to two other congressmen and a senator, Kentucky Republican Rand Paul. This is making the passage of legislation tricky. There are now calls from several quarters, including from President Trump, to consider changing rules to enable remote voting -- yet another possible norm change in the future across the world.",3815
"As coronavirus spreads, some Asian Americans worry their leaders’ language stokes a stigma","Samuels, Alex",Others,2020-03-23,"Until recently, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz’s daily podcast was most famous for one thing: daily musings about the U.S. Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. But in mid- March, the state’s junior senator waded into a new topic. While reflecting on his self-imposed self-quarantine, he defended the president for the administration’s response to the novel coronavirus.
Trump, the Texas Republican said, “wasn’t serving bat soup in the Wuhan province,” an apparent nod to a now-debunked myth that the outbreak began after a woman in China ate bat soup.
His comments are not an anomaly among GOP leaders. In a recent tweet, Trump called the novel coronavirus the “Chinese virus.” U.S. Sen. John Cornyn said he thought “China is to blame” for the illness “because [of] the culture” there. (Cornyn later said that he meant to say that the Chinese government was to blame, not Chinese people or Chinese culture.)
Texas now has more than 350 recorded infections and six dead, with a growing rate of increase — unleashing widespread fear and, in some instances, outright xenophobia and anti-Chinese sentiments among the nation’s leaders.
While health experts are using the term COVID-19 to describe the disease caused by the coronavirus that was discovered late last year, a number of prominent conservatives have adopted different monikers: the “Chinese virus,” “Wuhan virus” and reportedly even “Kung-Flu.”
Supporters of these terms counter both that the virus first appeared in Wuhan, China, and that other famous diseases are named after the site of the best-known outbreak. But experts note that this kind of language encourages people to view what’s now a global pandemic in overly simplistic geographic or racial terms.
One Asian American studies expert called the usage of such rhetoric “textbook racist discourse.”
“The renaming will have broader meanings and implications for Asians and Asian Americans in the country and around the globe,” said Yuan Shu, the director of the Asian Studies Program at Texas Tech University. “This gesture will fuel a new wave of crimes and stigmatizes the entire racial group.
“If the virus has already been named by the [World Health Organization] as COVID-19, any renaming is highly politically charged and motivated.”
The usage of such terms has also had a social cost for East Asians. Some said they were afraid of coughing or wearing face masks in public now, even as a simple precaution.
Eddie Pan, who volunteers at the Dallas Chinese Community Center, said the incidents he hears about reminds him of the discrimination Muslim people faced immediately after 9/11.
Using that language, Pan said, “lowers people’s perception of how widespread this could be. It helps people think, ‘If I’m not Chinese or I’m not Asian, then I can’t catch it.’”
Pan, 39, said he hasn’t personally experienced racism or discrimination in his hometown of Plano, but he said that treating the new coronavirus as a Chinese scourge “fuels prejudice” and could lead to the denigration of certain populations.
That denigration certainly isn’t unique to this year. When the Ebola outbreak emerged in 2014, Africans were the primary targets of stigmatization. During the SARS outbreak, East Asians were similarly discriminated against. “Stigma, to be honest, is more dangerous than the virus itself,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization’s director-general, said recently.
Madeline Hsu, a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said some people have seemingly tried to avoid her since the virus began to spread. More recently, when she was at a kickboxing class in Austin, she said she felt self-conscious after another woman, who is white, began talking “extremely loud to a woman next to her about the coronavirus.”
“Elected leaders using that type of language reinforces this idea that this virus is attached to a particular country or certain persons, which undermines efforts to manage it,” Hsu said. “This virus is not going to distinguish people on the basis of race or nationality.”To be sure, some GOP state leaders have taken pains to warn that everyone is vulnerable to the virus. Gov. Greg Abbott, who has consistently referred to it as the coronavirus or COVID-19, warned Thursday night that tens of thousands of Texans could be infected.
But even as fears over the virus have led to an uptick in reports of harassment and assault of Asian Americans and the decimation of Chinese and Asian American businesses, other leaders have continued using the terms. (In fact, the epicenter of the pandemic is now Italy, which has surpassed China as the country with the most coronavirus deaths.)
In a now-viral video posted to Twitter by The Hill, Cornyn said China has been “the source of a lot of these viruses” because “people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that.” During a conference call with reporters last week, the state’s senior senator also said that it’s “no coincidence” that illnesses such as the novel coronavirus originate in China, putting the onus on “some of the cultural practices there.”
Cornyn and other GOP leaders who have drawn pushback appear to be taking a page from Trump’s playbook. According to The Washington Post, a close-up of the president’s notes show he once crossed out the word “corona” and replaced it with “Chinese” as he spoke with his coronavirus task force. Speaking with the press, he has repeatedly defended his practice of calling the new coronavirus the “Chinese virus.”
“It’s not racist at all,” Trump told reporters last week when explaining his use of the term. “It comes from China, that’s why.”
Those protestations recall other cases in which Trump has used racist language, such as when he said four American women of color in Congress should “go back” to their countries or when he suggested a federal judge was biased against him because the judge is Mexican. (The federal judge was born in Indiana and is of Mexican American descent.)
That the coronavirus has spread beyond China’s border hasn’t diminished the spate of prejudice against the country, however. Nationally, foot traffic in Chinatowns has taken a nosedive, with some restaurants reporting losses of up to 80% of their business. To support these restaurants, some Texas officials have held public meetings and lunches at local Asian establishments to help quell public fears.
Before Abbott ordered the closure of bars and restaurants statewide, state Rep. Gene Wu, D-Houston, was encouraging his Twitter followers to visit local Asian grocers or restaurants in his or a neighboring state House district. “A lot of the Asian restaurants, not just Chinese, but Korean and Vietnamese restaurants, have been hit pretty hard,” he said. “If they go down, so will all the people who work for them.”
Wu was one of several officials who laced into Cornyn for his remarks about China, later describing the senator’s comments as “purely political.”
“There are actual real-world consequences when people use this kind of language,” Wu said, noting a recent case at a Midland Sam’s Club where a 19-year-old attacked an Asian American family.
The response to the virus has been similar globally. According to The New York Times, at a tourist hotspot in Vietnam, owners placed a makeshift sign outside their restaurant reading, “We can’t service for Chinese, SORRY.” Other places have refused to serve Chinese guests.
Lang Nguyen, who lives in Irving, said when he tried to vote ahead of the March elections, he started coughing after choking on some water. A woman in front of him, he said, proceeded to scold him before saying, “Well, all you Asian people are spreading the coronavirus, and I don’t want to partake in that mess that y’all started.”
“It’s like they’re mad at a specific country, so they want to point the finger. But what they don’t realize is they’re pointing the finger toward Chinese Americans and Asian Americans as well,” Nguyen, 34, said of the encounter.
Nguyen, who sheepishly acknowledged that he voted for Trump in 2016, said he plans to reexamine his options ahead of this fall; experts, too, note that Trump’s rhetoric could alienate a broader coalition of Asian American Republicans.
“Creating an anti-Asian bias is really problematic,” said Frank Fernandez, a senior research fellow with the Asian American Studies Center at the University of Houston and an assistant professor at the University of Mississippi. “Plus, the Asian American voting-age population is growing in the U.S., and people don’t forget these kinds of things.
“You’re stirring up racial bias, and this doesn’t go away,” Fernandez said.
In Plano, which has a large population of Asian Americans, Pan said he hoped government officials might be more thoughtful with their language in the near future.
“People need hope and positivity more than hatred,” Pan said. “I remember looking out the window on Sunday and just having this surreal feeling. ... It’s like zombie apocalypse.
“Makes me wonder if we’ll be like this in July, August or even later,” he added. “I’m sure I’m not the only person who feels like this, so let’s focus on the positive things. Not hatred and racism.”

Dr. Fauci said he would never call coronavirus the 'Chinese virus,' which Trump insists on doing","Haltiwanger, John",Others,2020-03-23,"President Donald Trump has repeatedly referred to the novel coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus.""
Anthony Fauci, the US's top expert on infectious disease, on Sunday said he'd never use this phrase to describe the virus.
Critics say the president has only begun referring to the novel coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" to distract from his own failures in response to the pandemic.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top expert on infectious disease, on Sunday he would never refer to the novel coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus.""
As President Donald Trump has sought to rewrite the history of his early response to the coronavirus pandemic, he's shifted to calling it the ""Chinese virus."" This has been widely decried as racist and a transparent attempt to distract from the Trump administration's failures and delayed reaction surrounding the pandemic.
Fauci was asked about this in an interview with Science Insider, and he said ""no"" when asked if would ever refer to coronavirus as the ""novel coronavirus.""
Question: You have not said China virus. [Trump frequently calls the cause of the spreading illness known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a ""China virus"" or a ""Chinese virus.""]
Fauci: Ever.
Question: And you never will, will you?
Fauci: No.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has urged against referring to the novel coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus,"" particularly as Asian Americans have reported instances of discrimination and public harassment as the virus spreads in the US.
Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC, earlier this month said it is ""absolutely wrong and inappropriate"" to call COVID-19 the ""Chinese coronavirus.""
Moreover, the CDC's website states: ""People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine...Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the problem.""
COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, originated in Wuhan, China. The Chinese government has been broadly criticized for suppressing information on the spread of the virus, particularly early on. But it's also taken measures that have seemingly been successful in slowing the rate of new infections.
In January, Trump praised China's response to the novel coronavirus, but he's shifted to blaming China for the global spread while referring to it as the ""Chinese virus.""

Meanwhile, Fauci, a public health hero who's led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for over 30 years, has emerged as one of the most trusted voices in the US amid the coronavirus pandemic.
But as coronavirus has spread acrosss the US, Fauci has had to walk a very fine line between keeping the public informed and calm, and not angering a president with a history of lashing out at aides and officials who are seen as undermining him.
With that said, Trump has a tendency to embellish or spread outright false information, which can be dangerous during a pandemic. On more than one occasion, Fauci has stepped up and contradicted or corrected statements made by the president.

Addressing the difficulty of this in the Science Insider interview, Fauci said: ""I can't jump in front of the microphone and push him down. OK, he said it. Let's try and get it corrected for the next time.""
When Fauci didn't appear at one of the White House's daily press briefings on the coronavirus response last week, it raised alarm bells that he'd been sidelined for being too honest and embarrassing a president with an aversion to facts.
In a separate interview with the New York Times, published on Saturday, Fauci said his straightforward style of talking is a ""risky business.""
""I say it the way it is, and if he's gonna get pissed off, he's gonna get pissed off. Thankfully, he is not. Interestingly,"" Fauci said, referring to Trump.
""I don't want to embarrass him,"" Fauci added. ""I don't want to act like a tough guy, like I stood up to the president. I just want to get the facts out. And instead of saying, 'You're wrong,' all you need to do is continually talk about what the data are and what the evidence is.""
Fauci said Trump ""gets that"" and ""takes it in a good way,"" calling him a ""smart guy.""",4749
"Trump’s use of ’Chinese virus’ term spurs anti-Asian slurs: Royal Palm teen, a Dreyfoos student, targeted at a Dairy Queen as pandemic emboldens racist comments","Rhodes, Wendy",Others,2020-03-25,"Lili McDonald likes ice cream.
So, when the 17-year-old Royal Palm Beach resident stopped by Dairy Queen last week, she was confused when another customer told her to “go to a Chinese restaurant.”
It took the teenager a moment to realize what was happening.
“It wasn’t just an off-comment where you say, that was kind of rude,” McDonald said. “It was actually very pointed and very racist.”
McDonald grew up in the United States, adopted at the age of 1 by an Irish-American family. Forgiving and unassuming, she was not accustomed to being singled out — and even less so to being verbally insulted.
“I’m not a very reactive person,” McDonald said. “I don’t process it, I’m not expecting it, I’m not waiting for someone to say something like that.”
That is changing in the era of the coronavirus pandemic. Advocacy organizations around the United States worry the health crisis will stoke bias and discrimination against Americans who immigrated from Asian countries as well as those of Asian descent.
Incidents of hate and violence have spiked so much that the website Teaching Tolerance has dedicated a section to teaching students how to speak up against racism related to coronavirus. And the organization Chinese for Affirmative Action now tracks assaults via voluntary reporting on its website.
Hundreds of cases have been recorded. Thousands more, particularly those occurring on social media, continue unabated. It is a reality McDonald and her family are now forced to accept.
Concerns also surged to the forefront of national conversations after President Donald Trump’s statements and tweets labeling the illness as the “Chinese virus.” A White House official also reportedly called the virus the “kung-flu” while a Republican lawmaker referred to it as the “Wuhan flu.”
The end result, intended or not, has filtered down to Main Street America.
“I realize I have to start almost being mentally prepared for that so I can react,” McDonald said.
Nancy Norton, McDonald’s mother, said she is shocked by the behavior of people in her own community. She said she now fears for her daughter’s safety.
“She’s not allowed to go out without me or her sister shadowing her,” Norton said. “If something happens, they are going to have to get through us first.”
Reports of assaults on Asian-Americans have been documented worldwide since January, as the flu spread far beyond its place of origin in China. But they spiked after Trump began using nicknames for the virus that implied Chinese people were somehow to blame, said John C. Yang, executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-AAJC.
“We’re now getting somewhere between five to six reports a day,” Yang said. “These incidents are not just verbal, but include physical assaults.”
On Monday, after being pressed by the White House press corps about criticism by advocacy groups about his use of the term “Chinese flu,” Trump conceded that verbal taunts, slurs and violence toward Asian-Americans are unacceptable.
Trump later tweeted: “It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world. They are amazing people, and the spreading of the Virus ...... is NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form. They are working closely with us to get rid of it. WE WILL PREVAIL TOGETHER!” he wrote in a series of tweets.
But the president did not back down from his use of the term, nor did he accept responsibility for spurring stigmatization of Asian Americans in using it.
For those on the front lines of the fight against racism, Trump’s condemnation of bias toward Asian-Americans provided little solace.
“We think it is better late than never that he spoke out against violence against Asian American’s, but it is unfortunate that it took him so long to do so,” Yang said.
The coronavirus outbreak, which began several months ago in Wuhan, China, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11. And as rapidly as it spread across the United States, so did misinformation and ignorance. Slanderous terms by an administration long accused of xenophobia soon followed.
“Using terms like ‘Chinese virus’ does have a stigmatizing effect,” Yang said. “It fuels prejudice because it’s based on the misperception that Chinese Americans are responsible for the virus or are somehow special carriers or transmitters of the virus, none of which we know are true.”
Trump has denied the term “Chinese virus” is racist, instead calling it a statement of fact. But nothing could be further from the truth for those suffering the consequences of bigotry invoked by such words, Yang said.
At McDonald’s West Palm Beach school, Alexander W. Dreyfoos School of the Arts, another Chinese American student said she was verbally assaulted by a classmate whom she previously considered a friend.
“Everyone knows Chinese people are disgusting,” she reported the antagonist saying. “They’ll eat any kind of animal. They’re dirty.”
The hurtful comments are but a sampling of what some have endured as a result of coronavirus-related aggression. People have been punched, kicked and spat on, according to numerous media reports.
The impact of such assaults affects not only those involved in the confrontations but those who witness them.
“Unfortunately, these events have caused all of us in these difficult times to be further isolated from each other,” Yang said. “There have been stories of good bystanders that have intervened, and that has helped people feel more unified. But, absolutely, the effect of these events is that it makes everyone feel less safe.”
Rui Falcon, secretary and treasurer of the Chinese Association of Science, Economics and Culture of South Florida, hopes that the work her organization is doing to combat the threat of coronavirus will help people realize that citizens of all ethnicities are equally important members of the community.
“This country is a melting pot, and it has been super successful in productivity and is the strongest country in the world,” she said. “That’s an indirect result of embracing many different cultures.”
Falcon’s organization has been distributing face masks to the elderly and plans to donate 3,000 more face masks and 120 bottles of hand sanitizer to local hospitals this week. “We would like to contribute very positively to fight against the virus with everybody in the community,” she said.
The group began sourcing much-needed medical supplies to send to China early in the crisis. Now, they are donating supplies locally to help protect medical personnel who are treating infected patients.
Falcon finds reports of assaults on Chinese-Americans troubling and says everyone is facing the same frustrations and uncertainty.
“There’s so much negativity here, because people are in fear,” she said. “The market is dropping, they’re losing a lot of money, they are losing their jobs, and there is a tremendous amount of anger over death and illness.”
But instead division, Falcon said now is the time for all Americans to work together to fight coronavirus.
“We’re one of you,” she said. “We’re all in this together. That is my main message. We all must work together — we’re a team.”",7177
'I don't want to get punched for being Asian': TV personality expresses virus-related racism,"Min-young, Lee",Others,2020-03-22,"The new coronavirus is spreading fast around the world and so is racism against Asian people.
TV personality and Korean-American lawyer Suh Dong-joo, 36, lashed out at the increasing number of racially motivated attacks against Koreans and other Asians in the United States amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
'Do you want us to wear a mask or not wear a mask? I'm getting mixed messages here,' Suh, who lives in San Francisco, wrote on Instagram. 'If Asians get beat up for both wearing a mask and not, what do you expect us to do?'
The comment comes five days after she posted the photo of herself wearing a face mask, saying she was concerned about growing racism. Asians see increase in racially motivated attacks against them
As the virus from the Chinese city of Wuhan continues to affect people around the world, concerns have been growing over xenophobic and racist attacks against people 'whoever look Chinese.'
Earlier in February, a video posted on Twitter of a women wearing a mask being punched, kicked and called a 'diseased b****' by a man in a New York City subway went viral.
On Feb. 24, Jonathan Mok, a 23-year-old Singaporean, was attacked while walking down the streets in London by a group of four men who said: 'we don't want your coronavirus in our country.' The attack resulted in a broken bone near his eye.
On Mar. 6, another disturbing video was widely circulated on social media, in which a black man sprayed Febreeze air freshener at an Asian guy after having an argument on a New York City train.

Main Street: Harvard's China Virus,"McGurn, William",Others,2020-03-31,"Amid the coronavirus wreckage, there seems to be a bright spot. The pushback against referring to Covid-19 as the ""China virus"" indicates a welcome new sensitivity for the racial discrimination directed at Chinese-Americans.
Or does it?
Ever since people began referring to ""the China virus"" -- or to be precise, ever since the White House press corps realized it was Donald Trump's preferred term -- the American people have been given repeated warnings that this is not only insensitive but dangerous. The subheadline of a recent New York Times story captures the tone: ""As bigots blame them for the coronavirus and President Trump labels it the 'Chinese virus,' many Chinese-Americans say they are terrified of what could come next.""
The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights has also chimed in with a statement warning public officials against normalizing ""xenophobic animosity toward Asian Americans"" by using ""the China virus."" The Council of Chief Diversity Officers at the University of California instructs the university community not to use terms like ""Chinese virus"" because they ""cast either intentional or unintentional projections of hatred toward Asian communities."" Beijing complains that Mr. Trump's use of such terms contributes to the ""stigmatization of China.""
It's hard not to notice the chasm between this new hypersensitivity and the indifference toward another, very real discrimination affecting this same community. That is the racial discrimination keeping Chinese-Americans out of America's most elite educational institutions. Some of the same people who fret so loudly about how we refer to Covid-19 are utterly indifferent to this other racial discrimination affecting Chinese-Americans.
Start with the mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio. After Mr. Trump tweeted out a reference to ""the China virus"" earlier this month, Mr. de Blasio clapped back. Asian-Americans, the mayor thundered, ""don't need you fueling more bigotry.""
If someone fuels bigotry by calling a virus a name accurately derived from its geographic origins, what about a mayor who works overtime to reduce the number of Asian- Americans in his city's most competitive public high schools, not because they haven't earned their entry but because they aren't the right race.
Ditto for Harvard. Remember, the chief argument against ""the China virus"" is that using it stigmatizes both China and people of Chinese descent. But what about the stigmas that come from the subjective ""personal ratings"" Harvard applies in its admissions process? The Justice Department says these ratings produce ""consistently poorer scores for Asian-Americans,"" a racial penalty that brings down an Asian-American applicant's overall score.
According to Students for Fair Admissions, the group suing Harvard over its use of race in admissions, Asian-Americans as a whole score higher ""on many objective measures than any other racial/ethnic group including test scores, academic achievement, and extracurricular activities."" But if we are to believe Harvard, Asian-Americans are less likable, less kind and less courageous than those of other races. If that's not stigmatization, what is?
Or take the World Health Organization, which prides itself on objectivity and professionalism. In 2015, WHO updated its best practices for naming new infectious diseases. The aim is to prevent a name from ""stigmatizing"" any particular community or country, and thus avoid negative implications for everything from trade and tourism to violence.
Yet WHO refers to the West Bank and Gaza as ""Occupied Palestinian territory."" Anyone ever ask the Israelis if they feel stigmatized or endangered when the world's premier health authority lends its imprimatur to such a politicized name?
In an attempt to restore some perspective, two members of U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Gail Heriot and Peter Kirsanow, issued a tart dissent from the majority's claim that people who say ""the China virus"" are encouraging ""xenophobic animosity."" Ms. Heriot and Mr. Kirsanow turn the tables on their fellow commissioners, pointing out that when authoritative organizations such as the commission indulge in ""promiscuous"" use of words such as ""racist, xenophobic, and hateful,"" it can also have ugly effects. All too often it means promoting the false notion that America is a steaming cauldron of hate just waiting to boil over.
Certainly Chinese-Americans (and others of Asian descent mistaken for them) are now enduring disgusting attacks and slurs from those unfairly blaming them for Covid-19. Much of this is crude name calling, such as the 13-year-old Connecticut girl taunted as ""corona"" by her classmates. Other acts by those blaming Chinese people for coronavirus are downright criminal, from the stabbing of an Asian-American father and son at a Texas Sam's Club to an assault on a New York man, who was kicked, spat on and told to go back to China.
As the Commission on Civil Rights rightly says, ""xenophobia wears many faces."" And in a nation of 330 million, America has its share of goons. What's Harvard's excuse?

Identity politics is the purveyor of real racism during coronavirus pandemic,"Ma, Ying",Others,2020-03-26,"Being on the receiving end of racism is not fun. For those of us who have experienced it, we know that it can be enraging and humiliating all at once.
It makes no difference what color or ethnicity the racist is, but this seemingly uncontroversial assertion has long been rejected, dismissed, or ignored by mainstream society and the liberal media. After all, the Left has taught that racism means prejudice plus power, and only white people, who hold the power in this country, can be racist.
Then the coronavirus outbreak took over daily life. All of a sudden, the media is open to reporting that Chinese Americans, along with other Asians who are mistaken as being of Chinese descent, are facing racism not just from white people but also racial and ethnic minorities.
On March 7, the New York Times published an op-ed by a young Chinese American woman who encountered racism from a Vietnamese nail technician at a salon. The technician, making an apparent reference to the origins of the coronavirus at a market in China where exotic animals were slaughtered and sold, said that Chinese people ate “weird” food and brought it to the United States. “Chinese people, I don’t like you. You are so bad, so bad, and so gross,” the Vietnamese nail technician added.
Upon reading the op-ed, a friend of mine observed, “I’ve seen the menus at Vietnamese restaurants. Vietnamese people have no business accusing anyone else of being ‘gross.’” Yes, many Vietnamese restaurants offer a panoply of entrails and similar items on the menu. Some might call it “weird.”
But food humor aside, those of us who hate identity politics have known for a long time that white people are not the sole source of racism. I have pointed out that some of the people who harbor the most hostility toward Asians are other Asian people. The story shared by the New York Times op-ed shows just how ugly that racism can be.
At the same time, those dishing out racism toward Asian Americans often include other people of color, such as African Americans.
Asian Americans who are familiar with urban settings know well that racism from other minorities such as African Americans is commonplace. I have even written a book, Chinese Girl in the Ghetto, talking about precisely the ugliness of such racism and the cravenness with which society and the media often avoid the subject. Shedding light on these incidents of racism is not an act of racism against the minority groups involved but a public way of bringing accountability to all for behavior that is unacceptable in modern society.
Of course, leftists who are now acknowledging that the perpetrators of coronavirus-inspired racism against Asian Americans include other people of color find it far easier to blame the entire phenomenon on President Trump and Republicans. Their logic supposes that because Trump and Republicans have used the term “Chinese virus” to describe the COVID-19 pandemic, they are fanning racism.
In reality, Trump and various Republicans began using the term to hold the communist Chinese government accountable for unleashing this horrible, infectious disease on the world and then lying to shirk responsibility. To Republicans, “Chinese” means China. They are not trying to malign their fellow Americans who did nothing wrong.
Certainly, to Asian Americans who are now facing racist attacks and unfairly shouldering the blame for the coronavirus, they do not believe their tormentors see a difference between “China” and “Chinese.” Understandably, they want their political leaders to use more responsible rhetoric.
Trump has done exactly that. Upon hearing about hate crimes and increased racism directed at Asian Americans due to the pandemic, he tweeted:
Tweet
He reiterated these sentiments at the White House coronavirus briefing on Monday and said:
“It seems that there could be a little bit of nasty language toward the Asian Americans in our country and I don’t like that at all ... so, I just wanted to make that point because they’re blaming China, and they are making statements to great American citizens that happened to be of Asian heritage, and I’m not gonna let that happen.”
It was, in some ways, a moment of high comedy, because Trump-haters had been feverishly labeling him as the person using “nasty language.” Trump appeared altogether oblivious to their complaints. After all, the president wholeheartedly says he is the “least racist person” anywhere in the world, no irony intended.
Chinese Americans who have no innate animus toward the president and who might otherwise applaud his policies ranging from strengthening border security to delivering a booming economy are glad that he has ceased using the term “Chinese virus.”
Yet, Trump haters and the worshipers of identity politics will find every opportunity to label him a racist. After all, their morally bankrupt ideology is based on the premise that America is a racist country. It is one reason why they have been so enamored and animated by reports of racism (real or imagined) against Asian Americans during the
pandemic.
Identity politics has brought endless dishonesty and division to this country and continues to do so. When the coronavirus pandemic subsides, America must try to rid itself of this tumor from within.

Coronavirus is inspiring racism,"Leung, Coleman",Others,2020-03-26,"To the ears of Asian Americans, the escalating crisis of the novel coronavirus in the United States is set against two horrible sounds.
One is the high-pitched wail of a mounting infection rate and an economy in free fall, as thousands more people are diagnosed every day and hundreds of thousands lose their jobs.
The other is the low drumbeat of anti-Asian racism. It’s a background noise growing louder, as President Donald Trump and many Republicans have tried to drown out critiques of their own bad decisions by refocusing blame on China and Chineseness.
This has had immediate, terrifying consequences for Asian Americans who could be perceived to be Chinese, and it’s a narrative that we will struggle to resist on our own. Though reactions to this scapegoating show how divorced Asian Americans have become from the solidarity we need — and why belief in our own exceptionalism was a trap.
-
Over the past two weeks, many Republicans pivoted to insist on the term “Chinese virus” at every opportunity. It was just the latest chapter in the Trump administration’s standoff with the Chinese government — an oppressive regime that does deserve criticism for its handling of the outbreak, whose officials have falsely suggested that the new coronavirus came from the United States.
The changes that the coronavirus has wrought are so overwhelming, a photo of people standing close to each other already feels like a missive from another planet. So it’s easy to understand how this latest flare of bigotry could be seen in a vacuum: new era, new kind of racism.
19th century propaganda
The only historical reference points that the media seem to use are those that involve Asians — Japanese internment, or late 19th century propaganda about “yellow peril.” I’ve even seen some of my fellow Asian Americans try to redirect the hatred, complaining that they’re being targeted despite not being Chinese, or that it’s stupid to be racist because South Korea and Taiwan have done such a good job at containing the virus.
This is a blinkered narrative. What is horrifying about coronavirus racism is not that it is new, or that it hits the “wrong” Asians. It is that what’s being targeted at Asian Americans — what the Trump administration has mindlessly enabled — is part of the ongoing story of American bigotry.
Asian Americans have sometimes struggled to understand our place within the wider landscape of race, bamboozled by the “model minority” myth pushed by white politicians. As the historian Ellen Wu has written, the idea that Chinese Americans in particular were high-achieving and compliant was exploited first to bolster an alliance with China during World War II, then spun to discredit the black civil rights movement.
(A movement from which, ironically, all Asian Americans greatly benefited.) The model minority term is one of American white supremacy’s most successful campaigns, simultaneously driving a wedge between Asian Americans and other people of colour and alienating us from our own right to dissent. What did we have to complain about, anyway?
Then there’s the term Asian American itself, a civil rights-inspired creation of the 1960s that has never managed to contain all the identities it was supposed to hold. A fourth-generation Chinese American shares little family history with a first-generation Cambodian immigrant — and the knowledge that many non-Asians don’t know or care about the difference can feel like an insult.
'Chinese virus'
We are an ethnically diffuse, low-voting group, wildly divided in economic class and too concentrated on the coasts to have any real impact on national elections. We are not, and have never been, a powerful united front. That’s part of why it’s so easy for Trump to call it the “Chinese virus,” wounding us all: Electorally, it won’t even hurt him.
That is, unless we use this moment to double down on solidarity. Asian Americans have often been accused, accurately, of not showing up for other people of colour. We have shied away from taking responsibility for our complicity in systems of power. (Although some Asian Americans have also been fiercely progressive advocates for racial and economic justice, even beyond our own little corner.)
As many writers and thinkers of colour have pointed out, it feels almost unbearably lopsided that white Americans can be so mediocre at ally-ship, while the rest of us flagellate each other and ourselves for not caring enough, not doing enough. The temptation to opt out altogether is strong. This might feel especially true, as we struggle with a kind of solidarity that feels completely unintuitive: physical retreat.
That’s why it’s so important to keep reminding ourselves that coronavirus racism is far from unique. It’s the same kind of hate that erupted after 9/11, aimed at Muslims and South Asians; it’s the hate that black Americans have been enduring for centuries. Asian Americans’ fixation on Asian-specific racism elides the bigger story.
In November — about a month and a half before doctors in Wuhan first identified the virus — the FBI released a report from 2018 showing that hate crimes involving physical assault were at a 16-year high. Vandalism was down; violence was up. Black Americans, as usual, bore the brunt of most hate crimes.
Scapegoating works
Notably, there was also a significant upswing in violence against Latinos, on the heels of Trump’s brutal rhetoric over undocumented immigrants and his obsession with the border. Experts stressed that the hate crime count was an imperfect record, since reporting and standards vary so much across the country. Nonetheless, the message seemed clear: Scapegoating works, and it works fast.
Now it’s Asian Americans’ turn. According to a representative from the organisation Chinese for Affirmative Action, there were at least 300 news stories published around the country between the end of February and beginning of March about attacks against Asian Americans.
Since then, a woman attacked a Korean college student in Manhattan, allegedly yanking her by the hair and punching her in the face while yelling, “Where’s your coronavirus mask, you Asian b--!” Just a few subway stops away, a teenager kicked a 59-year-old Asian man to the ground screaming, “Chinese coronavirus!” A few days later, a man attacked a Burmese father and his two children with a knife while they were shopping at a Sam’s Club in West Texas.
And those are only some of the most violent events. The reports of being yelled at, intimidated, or even spat at are legion. Some of the attackers also defy our assumptions of the lone, white race warrior: a few of the perpetrators are other people of colour. What stronger proof do we need of our painful divisions?
On Monday, Trump tweeted, unconvincingly, “It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world.” Needless to say, his is not the kind of “protection” we can believe in. As Asian Americans push back against what’s happening, I want to believe that other groups will show up for us, too — that they can trust we would show up for them.
This is the perfect moment for Asian Americans to acknowledge our debts to other people of colour, and show that we care just as much about anti-blackness, anti- brownness and ongoing colonialism as we do about what happens to people who look like us. We’ve never been alone in this; it’s time to stop acting like we are.
Coronavirus may be a new virus. But the hate it inflamed was there before, barely symptomatic and easily triggered. We should all assume that we’re already infected — and agree together that we’ll fight to eradicate it.",7669
Asian restaurants face backlash as bigotry unfolds,None,Others,2020-03-16,"In an Oval Office address, the president called it a foreign virus. The secretary of state referred to it as the Wuhan virus. Florida Sen. Rick Scott has repeatedly referred to it as the Chinese coronavirus.
Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, was first identified in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. As the virus infiltrates Tampa Bay, some members of the Asian community say they are feeling the impacts of such rhetoric. Chinese restaurants, in particular, have suffered financial hits. Many Chinese-owned restaurants in the Tampa Bay area reported a sudden and steep drop in sales while other restaurants said they were still experiencing a steady flow of customers.
Similar backlashes against Chinese- and Asian-owned restaurants have been reported across the country, most notably in New York City and San Francisco, both places with historic Chinatowns.
The events have spurred catastrophic hits in sales, prompting dozens of restaurants to resort to takeout only or shutter completely.
Peter Chen, who owns China Yuan in Tampa, said his business began dropping about 10 days ago, a few days after the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Florida.
All the business at Asian restaurants is dropping, Chen said. The last 10 days weve dropped 30 to 40 percent. Chens family has run the Cantonese-style restaurant on N Armenia Avenue for 15 years. While the recent dip in sales has hurt, Chen said he and his family members will take a pay cut if necessary to float the business.
We just have to make enough to pay our employees, he said. I have some money saved, but when your (sales) drop 50 percent or more, you can make it maybe one month
more. Longer? No way. People have to realize this isnt just in China anymore its the world.
At Liangs Bistro in New Tampa, general manager Jason David said business began declining the same day the first positive case of the coronavirus was reported.
The owners are Chinese, he said. The cooks are Chinese. We have a lot of regulars that know this and there were a lot of phone calls that day asking if we were getting our meats and seafood from China, David said. I think I got maybe 12 calls in one day.
David said that while the restaurants in-house business has dropped 10 to 20 percent, the takeout business has stayed about the same.
We havent hit pandemonium yet, and hopefully we wont.
Beyond the immediate business impact, Sam Obeid, program director for Community Tampa Bay, said the rhetoric could have a harmful impact on perpetuating stereotypes. Its especially true under the guidance of social distancing, a term used by public health officials to discourage close contact between people in an effort to curb the spread of disease.
Choosing to add stereotypes to an already stereotyped community is breeding new racism or adding to existing racism, Obeid said. We need to be living and surviving this in the spirit of community more than anything else.
In the weeks following the initial outbreak, accounts of racist comments were shared on Twitter and the hashtags #IAmNotAVirus and #JeNeSuis PasUnVirus in France began trending. Reports of a Singaporean man attacked on a London subway and accounts of racial profiling were shared on social media.
Michelle Phan, a makeup artist, YouTube personality and founder of Ipsy who grew up in Tampa and is of Vietnamese heritage, responded on Twitter to the racist comments on her Instagram account and YouTube videos. People told her to to go back to eating bats and accused Asians of starting diseases.
Id like remind the people whove been racist towards Asians because of the coronavirus, she wrote. 90% of everything you own was made in China including your phone. Bye.
A letter from a member of the Greater Orlando Chinese Professional Society to Scott calling his words offensive and discriminative made its way through WeChat circles, dividing many in the Tampa Chinese community who did not support the message or wish to sign the letter.
Wei Xue, A Chinese-American Tampa resident, said protesting terminology only served to further divide people.
At this critical moment, I think its unacceptable to confuse or cause fights just between parties or for political reasons, she said. The majority of us come here, we work hard, we know this country gave us opportunities and freedom, so we love this country.
Xue, who has lived in the U.S. for the past 27 years, considers herself American but still has family in China and was filled with worry when she first heard about the outbreak in Wuhan. The response she found from her community here was uplifting. The downturn in Chinese restaurant business isnt racist, Xue said, but a byproduct of people not wishing to go into any crowded public space.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises fighting stigma by communicating the facts that viruses do not target specific racial or ethnic groups.
The United Nations Human Rights Council has called for a fight against racism and the director general of the World Health Organization advised against discrimination and stigma.
Centers for Disease Control director Robert Redfield said it was wrong to refer to COVID-19 as Chinese coronavirus.
Scotts office said the senator, who has been self-quarantined after coming into contact with Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaros press secretary Fabio Wajngarten, stands by his terminology and called it a sad propaganda campaign from the Chinese Community Party to call it otherwise.
The virus originated in China, Chris Hartline, Scotts communications director, said in an email statement. The Chinese Communist Party lied about the virus. They lied about the numbers. They silenced critics and doctors who were raising red flags (one of the first doctors to warn about the virus subsequently died from it). They sacrificed their own people to try to prevent a PR problem. And the result was that the virus was allowed to spread further and quicker around the world.
Donna McGill, executive director of the Lealman and Asian Neighborhood Family Center in Lealman, which has the highest Asian population by percentage in Florida, said she has not heard any concerns.
We have worked so hard in this community to bridge that gap over the last 15 years, she said. I really dont hear it here. Maybe 15 years ago, but its a very different story now.",6325
"Several of my colleagues report racist microaggressions in the wake of coronavirus, and they're not alone. Here's why racism and xenophobia spread with infectious disease.","Ward, Marguerite",Others,2020-03-07,"Since the novel coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, it has infected more than 95,000 people.
What's also spreading are xenophobic and racist attacks against people of Asian descent, including microaggressions, or indirect expressions of intolerance like rude comments or dirty looks.
A number of Business Insider employees have experienced or witnessed microaggressions in recent weeks.
Josue David Cisneros, a University of Illinois professor who studies the link between racism and disease, said that America's history of anti-immigrant rhetoric plays a role.
A novel coronavirus outbreak that started in Wuhan, China, has killed more than 3,250 people and infected more than 95,000 on every continent except for Antarctica. (The vast majority of cases are in China.) There have been at least 11 reported deaths in the US so far. But the disease isn't the only thing spreading.
Many Americans are already dealing with another kind of flare-up: xenophobia and racism. There have been reports of blatant verbal and physical attacks around the world, from men trying to push a woman off her bike in the Netherlands, to a man in London being punched and kicked as he walked down the street. But what's impacting thousands more people of Asian descent are microaggressions, or indirect expressions of intolerance.
In general, microaggressions are common. A recent survey by Glassdoor of 1,100 US employees found that 61% had witnessed or experienced workplace discrimination based on age, race, gender, or LGBTQ identity. Add into the mix fear, rumors, and misinformation about a deadly, contagious disease, and the results are grim.
Although microaggressions can be subtle, their effects are real. Research published in the US National Library of Medicine from 2015 of 405 young adults of color found that experiencing microaggressions increased incidence of depression and suicidal ideation.
Unfortunately, I didn't have to look any further than my colleagues to find examples of racism and xenophobia in recent weeks.
Bryan Pietsch, an editorial fellow at Business Insider who's Korean-American, got on the subway in Brooklyn Thursday morning. As soon as he boarded, a middle-aged woman covered her mouth, glared at him, and then moved away.
""Her obviously covering her face and shooting me a dirty look just because I was standing near her made me feel disappointed,"" Pietsch said. ""It did make me concerned about how other people were interpreting the situation. If they saw her doing that, did that make them more concerned about my presence in the crowded car?""
Emily Park, an animation fellow at Business Insider who's Korean-American, was on the subway in Manhattan on Monday when she cleared her throat. A woman stared at her for several moments and then promptly got up and moved seats farther away.
""I'd heard of other Asian people experiencing something like this, but I hadn't yet, so it just felt kinda bad,"" Park said.
Alana Yzola, a senior producer at Business Insider, said she was recently in an Uber driving through Flushing, when her driver locked the doors and said ""there are a lot of Chinese here, you have to be careful,"" apparently referring to catching the coronavirus, which they had been discussing. Uber is investigating the incident.
Jennifer Hernandez, a customer success specialist at Business Insider, was getting off the PATH train from New Jersey to New York City and boarding an elevator when, she said, she witnessed a troubling interaction. She was on the elevator with 3 white males and one woman of Asian descent, all of them apparently strangers. The 3 men started talking about the coronavirus, with one commenting about how the spread was likely related to ""all the disgusting food Chinese people eat."" The Asian woman became visibly uncomfortable and upset, Hernandez said, eventually speaking up and defending Chinese food and culture.
Microaggressions toward people of Asian descent are becoming more common nationwide in the context of the coronavirus outbreak. A woman in South San Francisco sneezed into her elbow in a hallway in a hospital, where she was getting a flu shot, when a middle-aged white woman yelled a racist slur at her, NPR reported. Kids in Ontario thought it would be fun to play a game of testing one of their Asian peers for coronavirus, TIME reported. Some parents in Melbourne refused to let Asian doctors at one hospital treat their kids. Across France, the hashtag ""#JeNeSuisPasUnVirus"" or ""I am not a virus"" has gained traction in response to a slew of racist comments and attacks. A similar hashtag, ""#NoSoyUnVirus"" has taken off in Spain.
Racism and xenophobia spreads with infectious diseases
What is it about the rise of an infectious disease that makes for the spread of xenophobia or racism? Josue David Cisneros, professor at University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, has studied this phenomenon.
""It is not surprising that a new disease leads to public fear, stigma, and the scapegoating of certain kinds of people because we tend to understand these events through our past disease rhetoric, which is rooted in fear, stigma, scapegoating,"" Cisneros told Business Insider.
""Some of the US' first immigration laws were targeting Chinese immigrants because they were seen as racial, cultural, and biological threats, for example the Chinese Exclusion Act,"" Cisneros said. ""Perceived biological threat is tied to a perceived cultural threat.""
A recent example is President Trump's 2018 speech where he said undocumented immigrants ""infest"" the US. Cisneros added that anti-Chinese rhetoric, in particular, dates back to the 19th century, and has continued even as recently as the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the swine flu outbreak of 2009.
Lehigh University researchers found, for example, that media coverage of the SARS outbreak propagated negative images of Asians, which in turn led to ""detrimental"" emotional effects.
""Rather than focusing on relief efforts by the government and actions taken to contain the epidemic, mainstream media chose to simply expose and repeatedly accuse the Asian population of initiating the spread of SARS,"" the researchers found.
During the swine flue outbreak, fearmongering against people of Mexican descent was rampant, according to Cisneros. In 2009, NBC News reported on a number of talk show hosts saying xenophobic and racist things about Mexicans and people of Mexican descent.
Stanford University Graduate School of Business professor Hayagreeva Rao and former student Sunasir Dutta led a study on the relationship between infectious diseases and views on immigration. The study had 2 groups: one wasn't primed, while another was primed, to read about the new strains of flu. Those who were primed to think about the flu were less likely to support immigration.
""What our study shows very clearly is that exposure to discourse about contagious disease activates xenophobic tendencies in people,"" Rao said in an article on the university's blog.
""Somebody's contaminating the water supply, somebody's contaminating the food — these kinds of rumors are very common,"" Dutta said. ""And sometimes, they lead to violence.""
Despite the increase in racist and xenophobic microaggressions and attacks in early 2020, James Heimowitz, president of the China Institute, a nonprofit in New York City, told Business Insider that he feels those acts are not representative of what most people feel.
""While racism certainly exists in America, my overall impression and observation is that the majority of people are coming together and trying to collaborate during this global health crisis,"" he said.",7632
Asians on LI facing bias amid pandemic: Some growing anxious over virus-fueled discrimination,"Zou, Dandan; Weiss, Rachel",Others,2020-03-29,"Dr. Xinyu Zhao noticed that his son appeared upset after coming home one early March evening after school, as new coronavirus cases were just starting to spike in New York.
Later that evening, Zhao learned from his son that, in front of the whole class and a teacher, a fellow fifth-grader had told the boy to ""go back to your country and tell your people to stop eating bats and rats.""
Only four years ago Zhao, a gastroenterologist who works in Flushing, moved his family to Long Island, in part for his children to study in the Manhasset School District. The father of two said the incident greatly disturbed his son and sent home crying another Asian American child who witnessed the scene. After the parents reported it to school officials, the student who made the statement apologized.
But in the following days, before the school closed, Zhao felt somewhat uneasy when dropping his son off in the morning.
""I didn't know if he's going to have another incident at school, if somebody else would say something to him,"" said Zhao, 51. ""I never felt concerned to send my kids to school. But I feel very concerned now.""
As the coronavirus continues to spread rapidly, members of the Asian American community have grown increasingly anxious over what they feel is a backlash against them because the pandemic originated in China.
Wai-Lin Ng, who was born in Hong Kong and emigrated to the United States when she was a child, had never felt the sting of discrimination - until recently in a Rocky Point supermarket.
""This was during the time when there was a lot of panic-buying at the stores, with shelves emptying out,"" said Ng, who has worked at the Brookhaven National Laboratory for three decades. ""There was a woman passing by, and I saw her staring at me, and she basically pulled up her scarf over her nose and mouth.""
Ng, 56, of Sound Beach, at first thought it was just her imagination, then came to realize the meaning of the woman's actions. She realized she had never experienced anything like that before, having lived on Long Island for most of her adult life.
""It's not overt,"" she said. But, she added, ""we don't want to get beyond that. ... I think any ethnic group could potentially feel that they're targeted. But if it escalates, it could become a problem.""
Some in the Asian American community and experts have pointed to anecdotal accounts and news reports of a rising number of verbal and physical attacks nationwide.
Nassau and Suffolk police said this week that they have not received any reports of verbal or physical attacks targeting Asians on Long Island. But the NYPD this week said that the department has investigated 10 cases where Asians were victimized in incidents related to the outbreak, making six arrests so far.
Earlier this month, a 44-year-old man was charged with aggravated harassment as a hate crime after he allegedly yelled profanities and hit a man over the head at a bus stop in Queens. The NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force last month also retweeted a video showing an Asian woman being attacked in a Manhattan subway station, asking the victim to report the incident so that an investigation could ensue.
In the past few weeks, Christine Liu, a board member of the Chinese American Association of North Hempstead and the Herricks Chinese Association, said she has heard of more than a dozen reports of harassment and discrimination against Asians in Nassau County.
She knew of no physical attacks against Asians on Long Island. The cases she heard of ranged from minor incidents including Asian children noticing other students moving away from them on a school bus after they coughed, to serious ones such as a man yelling at an Asian man when he took a walk with his wife and daughters in New Hyde Park.
""A lot of Asians as well as other minorities are very fearful,"" said Liu, 40, of New Hyde Park. ""It only takes somebody who's mentally unstable to blame somebody in the Asian community and do something about it.""
Asian parents are also struggling to help their children cope with the newfound reality in the era of a deepening crisis.
David Chiang's grade-school-age children told him that they've heard others say ""don't hang out with the Asians if you don't want coronavirus.""
Chiang, 50, of Manhasset is concerned that the growing pandemic has exacerbated the long-standing perception of Asian Americans as outsiders.
""They are more American in language and culture,"" Chiang said of his three children. ""Their ethnicity, which should be a source of pride, instead causes social friction and makes them feel like outsiders.""
New York Attorney General Letitia James has established a hotline for the reporting of bias incidents and crimes in the state amid the pandemic. It can be reached at -771-7755 or via email at civil.rights@ag.ny.gov.
President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called COVID-19 a ""Chinese virus,"" has not helped matters, Asian Americans and advocates said.
Trump this week said he might stop using the phrase, also posting on Twitter a call to ""protect our Asian-American community"" and reaffirming that sentiment at the daily White House Coronavirus Task Force news briefing. But critics said that wasn't enough.
""Unfortunately, his response is late, and a lot of damage has been done,"" said Elizabeth OuYang, a civil rights attorney who teaches at New York University and Columbia University. ""It's better late than never, but it wouldn't have to be said at all if the president himself had not fueled xenophobia in the way he referred to the virus.""
OuYang noted that the World Health Organization already advised not to attach locations or ethnicities to a disease as it could fuel stigmatization.
""History is repeating itself,"" OuYang said. ""Whenever there's a war or there's an economic [downturn] in the United States, oftentimes it's the minorities and immigrants who are scapegoated.""
In recent weeks, the public hysteria as a result of the outbreak has reminded some Long Islanders of past periods of American history.
Jasleen Sabharwal, 60, of Oyster Bay still remembers the scene of a group of schoolchildren greeting her on Sept. 11, 2001, by yelling ""you ... [expletive] people did it again? Go back to your country"" as she walked from Manhattan to Queens.
Sabharwal, who emigrated from India in 1982, said the children yelled at her when she still had the white powder and fine glass on her face from the remains of the collapsed World Trade Center that day. Working at the time as an employee at Fiduciary Trust Company International, she lost nearly 100 colleagues after the south tower came down.
""Today, it's the Chinese. Tomorrow, it's the Indian,"" said Sabharwal, who survived the attacks because she had not yet reached her office on the 96th floor. ""It needs to stop now.""
Going back even further in history, Glen Cove resident Bob Machida, 75, grew up learning about internment camps from his family members.
During World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order to intern 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry in 10 camps after the Pearl Harbor attack on Dec. 7, 1941.
Before Machida was born, his aunt and uncle on the West Coast were sent to an internment camp in Utah, while his mother and father on the East Coast were tracked by an FBI agent.
""In a climate that's divisive like this, you could run into situations where some extremists may take advantage of a situation and say things they shouldn't,"" Machida said. ""We're one country, one multiracial country. And we're all in this together.""
Farrah Mozawalla, executive director of Nassau County's Office of Asian American Affairs, said people can report discriminatory incidents in New York by calling the Attorney General's Civil Rights Bureau at 800-771-7755 or the Nassau County Human Rights Commission at 516-571-3662. Long Islanders can find more resources on the Nassau County Asian American Affairs Facebook page. The latest facts on COVID-19 can be found by calling the Nassau County Coronavirus Call Center at 516-227-9570. Mozawalla said her office can translate all state and county information into Mandarin,

Victims of hate swamp LA center with complaints,Zhao Huanxin,Others,2020-03-26,"A new center for Asian Americans to report offensive behavior, including assaults, related to the novel coronavirus outbreak has received more than 500 submissions within four days, offering a glimpse into the extent of racism and bigotry affecting the community.
""We now have over 500 incident reports. They have been provided in English, simplified and traditional Chinese, Thai, Japanese and Korean. Just today, we added Vietnamese,"" said Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, or A3PCON.
The Los Angeles-based community group and the San Francisco-based advocacy organization Chinese for Affirmative Action opened the reporting center on Thursday to allow Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to report incidents of hate, which have been surging as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads.
Half of the cases are from outside California, ranging from shunning to verbal harassment, according to Kulkarni.
""Some of the more shocking ones are where somebody is throwing a bottle at someone. It looks like just in the last few hours we've gotten a case where somebody in New York was punched by another individual, so actually physically beaten,"" she said.
The cases will be used for assistance, advocacy and education purposes, she said.
Some US officials and lawmakers have repeatedly used the term ""Chinese virus"" or ""Wuhan virus"", even though the World Health Organization has a naming rule that prohibits linking a virus to a particular geographic location or group of people to avoid stigma.
As the terminology can falsely associate Asian Americans with the disease, Kulkarni said the labeling is putting people in harm's way.
While trying to stay safe and healthy, as other US citizens are doing, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are facing increasing anxieties and fears whenever they leave their homes to go to the grocery store, the pharmacy or even just to get outside for a walk, she said.
""This is a time that we need to come together to help each other out,"" Kulkarni said.
David Bernstein, president and CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, also opposed the use of what he called ""this unfortunate term"".
""It endangers Chinese and Asian Americans who are feeling the effects of rising bigotry,"" Bernstein said. ""We are organizing a Jewish and Asian American letter to the president and will issue it shortly.
""We worry both about the breakdown in international cooperation, at a time when we need it the most, and the impact it will have on vulnerable populations here in the US."" On Monday, US President Donald Trump tweeted: ""It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world. Kulkarni said she was glad to see the shift in the president's message, ""though we are concerned that significant damage was already done"".
""We hope this is not a temporary change, as some other more measured comments and corrections have been in the past,"" she said.",2986
A virus originating from China exposes blatant racism in America as the US struggles to respond to the coronavirus,"Frias, Lauren",Others,2020-03-20,"By calling the novel coronavirus the ""Chinese virus,"" it attaches an ethnicity to the virus that puts people of Asian descent at risk. As of Thursday, the coronavirus had infected more than 244,000 people worldwide, with the global death toll surpassing 10,000.
The novel coronavirus first detected late last year in Wuhan, China, is officially called SARS-CoV-2, and it causes a disease known as COVID-19.
Despite the scientific classifications, some people have latched onto a different name for the coronavirus, one with racist implications: ""Chinese virus.""
This week, the ""PBS NewsHour"" correspondent Yamiche Alcindor asked President Donald Trump — a regular user of the term — whether he thought ""Chinese virus"" and the less politically correct term ""Kung Flu"" might put Asian Americans at risk for racist attacks. The president said: ""Not at all. I think they probably would agree with it 100%. It comes from China.""
Attaching the virus to an ethnicity, however, has caused people in the US of Asian descent to become targets of racism and xenophobia, with Chinese restaurants temporarily closing because of a decrease in patronage, people being subject to hostile remarks, and, in some extreme cases, some Asians being physically assaulted.
—NYPD Hate Crimes (@NYPDHateCrimes) February 5, 2020
And it's not just the US where such acts of racism are being reported. An Asian man was assaulted in London as his attackers yelled: ""I don't want your coronavirus in my country."" The British Chinese filmmaker Lucy Sheen tweeted in February that she was told to go back to China and to take her ""filth"" back with her.
A Chinese student in Adelaide, Australia, was attacked simply because he was speaking a different language while walking down the street.
Normalizing the association between the coronavirus and those of Asian descent will only cause further divide at a time when fear and distrust already run rampant.
The coronavirus initially was largely referred to by the news media as the ""Wuhan coronavirus,"" a not-unusual scenario in which a novel virus is colloquially named after its place of origin (though the World Health Organization issued guidelines in 2015 advocating generic names for diseases). But while the coronavirus may have originated in Wuhan, in the Chinese province of Hubei, it has since made its way to more than 160 countries and territories.
As of Thursday, the coronavirus had infected more than 244,000 people worldwide, with the global death toll surpassing 10,000. It has affected China. It has affected Italy. It has affected Iran, Spain, Germany, the US, and more.
The virus is taking enough of a toll on friends, families, and communities — there's no reason for racism to add to that.

FBI warns of possible surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans as coronavirus spreads,"Yilek, Caitlin",Others,2020-03-27,"The FBI warned of an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans fueled by the coronavirus pandemic.
""The FBI assesses hate crime incidents against Asian Americans likely will surge across the United States, due to the spread of coronavirus disease ... endangering Asian American communities,"" an FBI intelligence report said, according to ABC News.
""The FBI makes this assessment based on the assumption that a portion of the U.S. public will associate COVID-19 with China and Asian American populations,” it continued. The analysis was compiled by the FBI’s Houston office and distributed to local law enforcement agencies across the country.
The virus, which was first discovered in China, has been referred to as the “Chinese virus” by President Trump rather than the coronavirus or the COVID-19 virus. Critics say Trump’s phrasing has fueled racism against people of Asian descent.
Trump defended his use of the term “Chinese virus,” arguing it was because the Chinese government was trying to pin the blame on U.S. soldiers.
“They said our soldiers started it. Our soldiers had nothing to do with it,” he told Fox News on Tuesday. “It came from China. I don’t regret it,” he said. “Everyone knows it came out of China, but I decided we shouldn’t make any more of a big deal out of it. I think I made a big deal, I think people understand it.”
In recent days, Trump has shifted away from using the phrasing and condemned the harassment of Asian Americans, who have reported being blamed for the spread of the virus.
""It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world,"" he tweeted. ""They are amazing people, and the spreading of the Virus is NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form.”
The FBI report did not make any reference to Trump or any other U.S. official who has called it the “Chinese virus.” The analysis said there has been an increase in reports of hate crimes and listed several incidents across the country.
In a March 14 incident in Midland, Texas, ""three Asian American family members, including a 2-year-old and 6-year-old, were stabbed ... The suspect indicated that he stabbed the family because he thought the family was Chinese, and infecting people with the coronavirus,” the FBI report said.",2295
WHEN A SLUR SOUNDS NOTHING LIKE THE TRUTH,"Norman, Tony",Others,2020-03-20,"When President Donald Trump stood before the microphone during a White House briefing about the coronavirus on Wednesday in which he declared himself a ""wartime president,"" it only required a slight adjustment of reality as far as he was concerned.
He had already laid the groundwork in a press conference the day before when he told reporters that contrary to what they had seen, heard and reported for weeks, he never called the coronavirus a ""hoax.""
""This is a pandemic,"" he said Tuesday. ""I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. All you had to do was look at other countries.""
Mr. Trump assumed that just because the heads of the reporters didn't explode from the weight of sheer cognitive dissonance, his Jedi mind trick had somehow worked. It hadn't.
Everyone knew that every word he said was in direct conflict with reality. With several members of the coronavirus task force flanking him, Mr. Trump declared war on an ""invisible enemy"" he could barely acknowledge weeks before.
So on Wednesday, the task force did not applaud or pin epaulettes on Mr. Trump's shoulder, but they did not embarrass him with gentle rebukes for wasting weeks of precious time that has endangered the public's health, either.
After only a few weeks of working with the Trump administration, these learned men and women have already taken the lessons of George Orwell's ""1984"" to heart: ""The past was alterable. The past has never been altered. Oceania was at war with Eurasia; therefore, Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia.""
While Mr. Trump's position on the legitimacy of fears concerning the coronavirus could charitably be described as ""fungible"" over time, he and his allies have been remarkably consistent about one element - the open embrace of anti-Asian xenophobia and racism for geopolitical advantage.
While everyone is keenly aware of Mr. Trump's clumsy attempts to distract from his administration's incompetence in rallying the nation and marshaling its resources to combat COVID-19, his attempts to racially brand a global disease still can't go unaddressed.
Racism matters. It is only those who have benefited most from the privileges afforded by racism who insist with a straight face that ""rising to the Trump administration's bait"" by even objecting to it at this time endangers the public health.
It is possible to do two things at once - call out the president's incompetence while also pointing out his racism and those of his surrogates who are trying to rebrand COVID-19 the ""Chinese virus"" in the middle of a global pandemic.
Bear in mind, these are members of a political party that, until a few days ago, wasn't willing to entertain the possibility that COVID-19 was anything more than an elaborate media hoax concocted to embarrass Mr. Trump, tank the economy and steal the election for the Democrats.
Sen. John Cornyn, one of Texas' two Republican senators, spelled it out for a reporter who quizzed him about the cost of demonizing Asians in a land that has been historically intolerant of them, especially during pandemics.
""That's where it came from,"" Mr. Cornyn said, as if geographic origin was anything more than a twirl of the dice. ""I think China is to blame because the culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that, these viruses are transmitted from the animal to the people and that's why China has been the source of a lot of these viruses like SARS, like MERS, the Swine flu, and now the coronavirus,"" he said. ""So I think they have a fundamental problem, and I don't object to geographically identifying where it's coming from.""
Mr. Cornyn and his ilk would've objected strongly if the strain of deadly Creutzfeldt-Jakob bovine disease, otherwise known as ""Mad Cow disease,"" that re-emerged on an American farm and in Canada in 2003, had been re-dubbed ""North American Mad Cow disease."" That's because the Republican senator and all of those eager to paint a
worldwide pandemic as uniquely Chinese are well aware of the power of stigma and what it would mean if it were ever used against many American factory farms where diseases thrive.
To xenophobic ears in America, ""China is to blame"" translates into ""Asians are to blame"" at street level, which may explain why Asian Americans of all backgrounds are reporting more assaults and acts of bias and discrimination leveled at them and triggered by COVID-19.
Throughout American history, both political parties have been guilty of using anti-Asian American bias to advance cynical political ends, but it has been the Republicans that have turned an ethnic smear into an art most recently with not-so-subtle dog whistles about what Asians allegedly eat when decent Republicans aren't looking.
While it is true that Chinese authorities have finally shut down the infamous ""wet markets"" of Wuhan where exotic animals were cooked and served to adventurous natives and tourists, there's more to the origin and spread of this disease than a pot of ""bat stew"" gone bad.
If we ever hope to understand and treat new versions of this virus going forward, we're going to have to work in concert with the Chinese government and its scientists. A strategy of mutual cooperation might be endangered if China objects to being made the racial boogeyman of the American right, displacing Muslims and Hispanics.
But nativism and racism run thick in Mr. Trump's Republican Party, where most pendants fall back on the excuse for racism that amounts to no more than: ""Well, that's where the virus came from so that's what I'm going to call it, no matter what.""
If you ask the folks who want to redub COVID-19 the Chinese virus what's wrong with referring to it as the coronavirus without assigning a region to it, they fake offense and accuse you of being both Orwellian and ""politically correct.""
On Wednesday, senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway took her defense of the Trump administration to absurd lengths by casually reminding the reporters grilling her that she knows a thing or two about discrimination herself. ""I'm married to an Asian,"" Ms. Conway said referring to conservative attorney George Conway, one of Mr. Trump's fiercest critics.
The reporters didn't know quite what to do with that bit of irrelevant information, so Ms. Conway quipped that since they were all ""so obsessed with race,"" she assumed they were aware of that fact. Again, the reporters scratched their heads over such a pointless non sequitur, hoping against hope that her ultimate point was not that some of her best friends were Asian. Even the Trump administration's highest-ranking propagandist had to do better than that.",6632
Shocking video shows a New York City subway rider spraying an Asian man and yelling at him to move,"Collman, Ashley",Others,2020-03-06,"Two videos posted on Facebook on Wednesday showed a New York City subway rider yelling at an Asian man, telling him to move out of his way, and eventually spraying a can of what appears to be Febreze at him.
The NYPD is investigating the incident, according to the New York Post.
Asian Americans have said they've been the victims of racist attacks because of the coronavirus outbreak that originated in China.
As Asian Americans say they're experiencing more incidents of racism amid the coronavirus outbreak, a worrying video surfaced on Wednesday showing an Asian man being harassed on the New York City subway and being sprayed with a can of what appears to be Febreze.
Two videos showing the incident were posted on Facebook on Wednesday. The first showed a rider yelling at the Asian man and repeatedly ordering him to move. When people on the train asked the man why he was asking the stranger to get out of his way, the man shouted, ""Because he's standing right f---ing next to me!""
The upset man then grabs a spray can and starts spraying it at the Asian man, who remained standing near the door of the subway car. The second video showed the Asian man confronting the other man, asking: ""Why is that? Why can't I sit next to you?""
The New York Police Department confirmed to the New York Post on Thursday that the Hate Crimes Task Force was investigating. A representative said that someone called 911 to report the incident but that by the time officers arrived at the station the train had already departed, so no report was taken.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority retweeted the video on Thursday and described it as racist.
""What works in stopping the spread of Coronavirus: 1. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds. 2. Cough and sneeze into your elbow. 3. Stay home if you're sick,"" the tweet said. ""What doesn't work: 1. Racism.""",1855
Coronavirus stigma adds to long-term challenges for North American Chinatowns,"Magnier, Mark",Others,2020-03-01,"Chinatowns across North ­America are reeling as panic and ignorance spread faster than the actual coronavirus, in the latest blow to neighbourhoods already battered by gentrification and an identity crisis.
Chinese communities from New York to California and ­Ontario to New Mexico report that business is down as much as 70 per cent. Parades, street fairs and Spring Festival banquets have been cancelled, malls are empty and streets deserted.
Chinatown businesspeople say the biggest drop is not necessarily among Caucasian customers but Chinese- Americans alarmed by sensationalistic postings on WeChat and Weibo.
""Everyone's panicking,"" said Tony Hu, sitting in his empty Lao Sze Chuan restaurant during ­dinnertime in Chicago's Chinatown. ""It's crazy.""
Particularly hard hit are ­American companies dependent on ­Chinese tourists. Tourism ­Economics, a consultancy, ­expects Chinese visitors to fall nearly 30 per cent this year, and take some time to recover, costing the US economy US$10.3 billion through 2024.
Lisa Shan, a plasticware wholesaler serving some 100 ­Chinese restaurants in Flushing, New York, expects several of them to fold soon. ""This crisis is worse than Sars,"" she said, referring to the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome.
Beyond the economic headwinds, Chinese in North America are targets of mounting xenophobia and discrimination, including some being told to ""go home"".
Although fear is a natural ­response to danger, especially given how much remains ­unknown about Covid-19 - the disease caused by the coronavirus - the crisis has fanned entrenched stereotypes, say sociologists.
A leaflet in the Carson area of Los Angeles with a fake World Health Organisation seal warned residents to avoid Asian- ­American businesses because of the coronavirus. A middle school student of Asian descent was ­reportedly assaulted and sent to hospital in southern California after classmates accused him of having the virus. Online postings suggest the illness should be ­renamed ""Kung Flu"".
Other bullying, shunning and assault cases have been reported across the continent, sparked by unfounded fears that people with Asian features are more likely to carry the virus.
But Asian-Americans are not immune from sharing these fears.
Ray Tong, a contractor in ­Milpitas, California, avoids his favourite Chinese restaurants ­despite being Chinese- American. Recently, he headed to a Middle Eastern restaurant only to find that several other Chinese had the same plan. ""Well, so much for that idea,"" Tong said. ""The restaurant's name doesn't alter where the virus might eventually decide to visit.""
Civic boosters have tried to lift the spirits and pocketbooks of Chinatowns with rallies, raffles, workshops and public service ­announcements. ""Focus on facts, not fear,"" urged the Los Angeles county public health department, which warned against stigmatising Asians.
Canada started a ""Together We Win"" campaign, while New York, with North America's largest Chinese-American community, started ""Show Some Love in ­Chinatown"" to urge customers to ­return.
Others are fighting the virus with online campaigns, such as #LoveBostonChinatown, #IamNotAVirus and
#coronaracism.
Mayors, meanwhile, are leading with their chopsticks.
Mayors Libby Schaaf of Oakland, California, and Bill de Blasio of New York both dined on dim sum as the cameras whirred.
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi bought a wok in San Francisco's Chinatown. Chicago locals organised a reassuring ""food crawl"" through beleaguered Chinese ­restaurants. And Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney dived into a well-publicised plate of shrimp dumplings.
""Call it an act of moral, political and culinary support,"" The Philadelphia Inquirer said.
California, with far more Asian-Americans than any other US state, has redoubled efforts to deter fear-stoked violence and discrimination.
But the toxic climate of ­national politics has not helped, said Manjusha Kulkarni, leader of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, which representing 1.5 million Los Angeles residents. The group recently hosted a rally against virus-related racism.
""We believe the Trump ­administration has fanned the flames of xenophobia, much of it directed at China because of trade,"" Kulkarni said. ""His uplifting of white supremacy messages is a cause of concern for communities of colour and immigrant communities around the ­country.""
But Beijing has not helped with its early attempts to hide the disease and its decision to change the methods for counting ­infections, moves that have undercut trust and dented Asian-Americans' reputations.
In response, New York state assemblyman Ron Kim created an Asian-American health council to educate people, provide care and show that Asian-American doctors were part of the solution.
""We're trying to separate the virus from any one people or ­culture,"" said Kim, whose district includes Flushing. ""The virus has no walls.""
The latest virus-related prejudice dovetails with a history of stigmatisation. In the wake of a surge of Chinese immigrants after 1850, US health officials - without evidence - often viewed Chinatowns as sources of leprosy, smallpox, bubonic plague and tuberculosis outbreaks.
""This hearkens back to the initiation of 'yellow peril' hysteria from the 18th century through the 19th century until now, the newest iteration,"" Kulkarni said.
The coronavirus epidemic is only the latest challenge to hit North American Chinatowns.
Historically discriminated against, their rights curtailed, forbidden to buy real estate elsewhere, Chinese retreated for protection to land shunned by the Caucasian mainstream, creating tight-knit communities.
As inner cities revived in recent decades, however, developers have often coveted the ground under Chinatowns, fuelling gentrification. The National Trust for Canada has listed Vancouver's Chinatown among the country's most endangered places.
And a 2013 report by the Asian-American Legal Defence and Education Fund found that Asian residents went from the majority to a minority between 1990 and 2010 in the Boston, New York and Philadelphia Chinatowns.
While gentrification is hardly unique to Chinatowns, the ­pressures are often more pronounced given the long histories and tight-knit structures of ­Chinese in America.
Tenant harassment, weaponised lawsuits and overzealous ­policing of street vendors are among developers' preferred tactics, said Diane Wong, a New York University faculty fellow studying Chinatown gentrification. Developers recently broke ground on a 725-unit luxury flat project and a rail hub in Los ­Angeles' Chinatown, while ­Calgary, Alberta, ­approved a massive residential tower in the heart of that city's Chinese community.
Two Chinese neighbourhoods in New York face similar pressure. A US$1.4 billion, 815-unit tower is being built in Manhattan's Chinatown - complete with a dog-washing room, communal herb garden and outdoor tea pavilion - and activists in Flushing are trying and fight off a 11.7-hectare luxury residential development there.
""We need affordable housing, and some of these apartments start at US$1 million,"" said Kim, the assemblyman. Also squeezing Chinatowns are efforts by politicians to locate undesirable projects that more ­affluent neighbourhoods shun. Manhattan's Chinatown is fighting plans to expand a prison. ­Chicago's had a big transit
hub, and Boston's a large medical ­centre, imposed on them. Portland built a homeless shelter at Chinatown's gateway, causing businesses to flee.
""Chinatowns don't request these things,"" said David Lei, a board member with San Francisco's Centre for Asian- American Media. ""Chinatowns around the US don't have a say in City Hall.""
Chinatowns are also vexed by core identity issues. Most were built for immigrant labourers who pooled their savings, started businesses and joined community ­associations. Now, increasingly wealthy, well-educated, WeChat-networked migrants flock to the suburbs, eroding the fabric of once-tight communities.
That's left many neighbourhoods as little more than a stop for tourists. Some believe it may be time to accept the inevitable and embrace the idea of a digital ­Chinatown.
Washington, DC, is among the best examples of a vanishing ­Chinatown, while Detroit's has completely disappeared.
""They've become tourist destinations, with everything from sports to Shakespeare, upscale bowling alleys and shopping centres,"" said Frank Wu, a law professor at the University of California, Hastings. ""But they don't actually involve Chinese people.""",8565

Today they’ve had fewer than 20 customers over three hours, says manager May Deng. “At least a 90% drop. That’s huge.”
If business doesn’t pick up in the next two to three months, she’ll have to close. “How can you survive?” says Ms. May, tears rimming her eyes.
From Boston to San Francisco, London to Johannesburg, customers have been avoiding Chinatowns amid unsubstantiated fears that the virus jumped from China via these neighborhoods. There have been news reports, too, of bullying, discrimination, and xenophobia against Asians. But others warn that such isolationist impulses create a sense of alienation in those communities. And some individuals, public officials, and organizations are stepping forward to practice acts of kindness and model support for Chinese businesses.
“The virus has no nationality. The virus does not practice discrimination. Why should we, being a human being, discriminate against any ethnic group?” says Justin Yu, president of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, a business and community organization in New York City. “This is a time for everybody to learn we should have sympathy.”
Deeply ingrained cultural prejudices about Chinese people as supposed carriers of disease date back further than the outbreak of SARS, says Winston Tseng, a research sociologist and lecturer of community health and human development at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health in California. In 1899, Honolulu forcibly quarantined its Chinatown due to fears of the bubonic plague; the following year, San Francisco circled its Chinatown with rope for two days.
“There was an assumption ... of ‘the yellow peril,’” says Mr. Tseng. “So Chinese or Japanese back then were [viewed as] dirty and carrying a lot of diseases.”
Today, individuals across the world are reaching out to help Chinese and Asian businesses. In Australia, the progressive activist group GetUp! encouraged its members to dine in Chinese restaurants and also post pictures of meals on social media with the hashtag #IWillEatWithYou. It was a response to news reports such as the closure of Shark Fin House, a three-decades-old restaurant in Melbourne’s Chinatown, says the group’s media adviser Chandi Bates. The hashtag is now popping up on Twitter and Instagram accounts in other parts of the world.
“I Will Eat With You is giving people a practical way to take a positive step, show support and solidarity to businesses that need it, all at the same time as eating a delicious meal,” says Renaire Druery, campaign director for the GetUp! Human Rights Campaign, via email.
In mid-February, Boston Mayor Martin Walsh started a social media campaign with the hashtag
#LoveBostonChinatown. He and other city councilors organized a photo-op dim sum lunch at once-popular eatery China Pearl. In early March, there’s not a lot of foot traffic beneath the pagoda-style arch entryway into Chinatown. A nearby outdoor table of tourist trinkets remains untroubled. Atop the lamp posts along Beach Street, American flags flutter in tandem with Chinese flags in the wind.
“It’s important to continue supporting the people that would be perhaps impacted the most right now because they have bills to pay,” says Andrew, a Massachusetts technology professional who asked that his last name not be used, after coming to Chinatown specifically to support the restaurants.
Another tourist, Fred Brown from Atlanta, was surprised how much busier Boston’s Italian North End neighborhood was by comparison, given the news of the outbreak in northern Italy.
“I would take precautions, but I don’t think it’s necessarily here in Chinatown in Boston,” says his daughter, Emily Brown, just prior to entering a restaurant. The Boston resident says she’s not fearful about contagion. “Especially when this place has an acceptable health code.”
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there have also been multiple reports of racist online comments and also some troubling incidents offline.
Dr. Barbara Ferrer, director of public health for Los Angeles County, says the county has dealt with hoaxes related to the virus, including a bogus press release on a fake official letterhead that attempted to target an Asian community.
The letter stated erroneously that five infected patients had supposedly visited five businesses in Asian areas of Carson, including a Chinese restaurant.
“None of that was true,” says Dr. Ferrer. The department responded quickly to stamp out the misinformation, and the case is being investigated by the county sheriff’s department and the FBI.
A lot of Asians and Asian Americans live in the county –more than anywhere else in the country –and “unfortunately and inappropriately” a “stigma” is attaching itself to that community, she says. “Chinese restaurants are safe,” she emphasized.
At least two U.S. officials, Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo –have begun labeling COVID-19 as the “Wuhan virus.” This month, the World Health Organization implored people not to attach locations or ethnicity to the disease, including “Wuhan Virus,” “Chinese Virus,” or “Asian Virus.” “The official name for the disease was deliberately chosen to avoid stigmatization,” said WHO.
In Canada, the Toronto suburb of Markham –sister city to Wuhan, China –is striving to counter negative associations. When Wuhan Noodle 1950, a Chinese restaurant across the street from city hall, started losing business due to fears of the virus, officials knew exactly what to do. During the height of the SARS crisis in 2003, the neighborhood successfully persuaded many people in Toronto to overcome their fear by inaugurating a Taste of Asia festival. In February, Markham Mayor Frank Scarpitti launched an Asialicious festival in which more than 100 Asian restaurants in the Toronto area invited customers to tasting events that included special offers.
When the mayor attended a recent Chinese New Year event, he shared a social media video with guests. In it, dozens of people in the quarantined city lean out of their balconies and, in unison, shout, “Wuhan jiayou,” which is roughly translated, “Wuhan keep up the fight.” In turn, Markham’s mayor recorded a video in which the thousand attendees at the banquet shouted, “Wuhan jiayou!”
“The mayor of Wuhan sent us a letter expressing their gratitude for the video and for the fundraising and just generally the support that has been shown to Wuhan,” says Mayor Scarpitti. “It’s a reminder that we live in a pretty big world, but it can get pretty small at times and we can be connected in some pretty powerful ways.”

Anti-Asian sentiment grows in US as Trump calls corona the 'Chinese virus',None,Others,2020-03-20,"Asian-Americans report rise in hate crimes, fuelled, rights groups say, by President Donald Trump’s own rhetoric
On a normal weekday the streets of Manhattan’s Chinatown are filled with people spilling out from heaving restaurants. But for weeks now it has resembled a ghost-town.
“We were already down customers after the coronavirus was reported in China,” one restaurant owner told The Telegraph, “but in March we saw a big drop.”
The loss of business could partly be put down to people deciding to self-isolate at home, he figured, but delivery orders were down too, which made him suspect there was a more sinister reason.
Asian-Americans have reported a rise in hate crimes and discrimination as the US grapples with the growing health crisis, fuelled, rights groups say, by President Donald Trump’s own rhetoric.
Mr Trump, who has attempted to shift blame for the outbreak paralysing swathes of the country, onto Beijing, repeatedly calling Covid-19 the “Chinese virus” and the “foreign virus”.
A close-up of the president's notes on Thursday even showed where the word ""corona"" had been crossed out and replaced with ""Chinese"" in black marker pen.
Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State, meanwhile, has been referring to it as “Wuhan flu”.
John Cornyn, Republican senator for Texas, defended Mr Trump’s use of the term, saying: ""China is to blame because the culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that, these viruses are transmitted from the animal to the people and that's why China has been the source of a lot of these viruses like SARS, like MERS, the Swine Flu.""
A White House official even called the virus the “Kung Flu” during a briefing with China-born American reporter from CBS News. “Makes me wonder what they’re calling it behind my back,” Weijia Jiang tweeted.
Members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus warned fellow lawmakers against contributing to ""discriminatory language"" after a senator suggested that the coronavirus had been created in a laboratory in China.
The World Health Organisation has advised against terms that link the virus to China or the city of Wuhan, where it was first reported, in order to avoid discrimination or stigmatisation.
Xinhua, China’s official news agency, said Mr Trump’s language was “racist and xenophobic” and revealed “politicians' irresponsibility and incompetence”, risking increasing fears over the virus.
Videos have been posted on social media of people riding the subway in New York harassing Asian commuters. One can be heard telling a woman wearing a face mask to “go home and stop infecting people”.
One Korean user joked that “being Asian on public transport was the new Arab”.

“My kids are being called ‘corona’ in school,” tweeted Jordan Matsudaira, former chief economist on Barack Obama’s Presidential Council of Economic Advisers.
To counteract the #Chinesevirus hashtag trending on Twitter, Asian users have begun using the global hashtag #JeNeSuisPasUnVirus--French for ""I am not a virus.""
Gun shops around the country have reported a rise in the number of Asian-Americans buying weapons, citing concerns they will face a backlash.
“People are panicking because they don’t feel secure. They worry about a riot or maybe that people will start to target the Chinese,” David Liu, a Chinese-American gun dealer outside Los Angeles, told the Trace.
Back in Chinatown, the latest figures show trade is down by as much as 70 per cent, and that was before New York’s governor issued a mandatory takeout and delivery only order for restaurants starting Tuesday.
Public health experts note that many reasons people cite for avoiding Chinese restaurants are unfounded and are a result of misinformation: people do not contract the virus through food originating in China.
The US has now recorded more than 8,000 cases across all 50 states, but the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that ""at this time, this virus is not currently spreading in the (Chinese) community in the United States.""
Charissa Cheah, a professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Maryland, who is looking into the prejudice public health emergencies such as Covid-19 tend to reveal, told the Telegraph that Asian-American families in communities across the US have reported seeing a rise in abuse.
Parents tell her children are being ostracised by others and are afraid of openly showing any symptoms of illness for fear of being further shunned.
While viruses do not discriminate, there are many examples through history of immigrant populations being discriminated against during outbreaks: Jewish communities were targeted during the bubonic plague in the 1300s, Irish immigrants were blamed for typhoid in the 1800s, and West Africans for Ebola in 2014.
Ms Cheah said that Mr Trump’s use of language has refuelled historical racist tropes.
“In times of fear, people react in ways that reinforce group identity and stereotypes about ‘The Other'. Asian-Americans have always been treated as the other, the perpetual foreigner, regardless of how many generations they have been in the US,"" she said.
“We are trying to educate people in communities with Asian populations that this thinking is wrong. But it’s hard when the leader of the country is effectively validating this discrimination.”",5491
Students fear bullying in reaction to new virus Some parents report children of Asian descent have been harassed,"Travis, Scott",Others,2020-03-01,"Even with no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Florida, some parents fear an outbreak of bullying of Asian children.
Local school districts report no knowledge of kids being harassed as a result of the virus, but several South Florida parents have taken to social media to say their kids are being accused of carrying coronavirus, just because they're Asian.
The virus, which causes the disease COVID-19, originated in Wuhan in the Hubei province in China.
""My son was verbally attacked while walking to the library after school today by a group of boys telling him he shouldn't be here because of the coronavirus,"" Weston mom Kate Chu wrote in the Facebook group ""Weston and Beyond."" ""When he refused to engage with the offenders by ignoring them, they continued their verbal barrage until it escalated to them physically pushing and grabbing him.""
Chu, who could not be reached for comment, posted that the bullies were middle school students and that the principal of her child's school was responsive to her concerns. She encouraged members of the group to ""please talk with your kids and teach them to be kind and be respectful of others.""
Ivette M. Yee, a marketing profession and the former president of the Florida chapter of the Asian American Journalists Association, said she's been hearing about other issues as well. She said a friend posted on social media that her children were confronted at school by classmates who made similar comments tying them to the virus.
""This is unacceptable and it must stop,"" Yee said. ""I fear that once - and if - the coronavirus reaches the U.S. at a critical mass, these incidents will surely multiply.""
Compared to other groups, the number of Asian students in South Florida schools is small. They make up about 3% in Palm Beach County, 3.9% in Broward and 1% in Miami-Dade County. About 20,000 Asian students attend the three districts, records show.
None of the three districts said they were aware of any bullying cases against Asian students. Still, Palm County schools spokeswoman Claudia Shea said the district is including information about treating others with respect as part of a new coronavirus website scheduled to launch Monday.
""We have not seen instances of bad behavior as a reaction to coronavirus concerns. However, it's important to be proactive,"" Shea said.
The website will include information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention telling people that ""fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma"" toward Asian Americans.
""Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the problem. We can fight stigma and help not hurt others by providing social support,"" the district's website will say. ""We can communicate the facts that being Chinese or Asian American does not increase the chance of getting or spreading COVID-19.""
Yee said she has offered to work with the Asian American Journalists Association and other local groups to create
a media campaign to help educate the public about misinformation and bullying.
'I believe we have an opportunity here as communicators, storytellers, and thought leaders to educate and make things right,"" she said.
This issue raised alarm in Calfornia's San Fernando Valley, after CBS News reported Feb. 14 that a 16-year-old boy ended up in the hospital after being physically attacked by bullies in his high school who accused him of having the coronavirus.
As a result of that attack, the national group OCA-Asian Pacific American Advocates called on school districts, superintendents, parent groups and school administrators to ""take proactive measures to educate students surrounding coronavirus and reinforce or implement preventative measures against race-based bullying.""
OCA is calling on school districts, superintendents, Parent Teacher Associations, school administrators and staff to take proactive measures to educate students about coronavirus and reinforce or implement preventative measures against race-based bullying.
""It's crucial that schools and administrators around the country act now to prevent further bullying and harassment of ... students rooted in racism and misinformation about coronavirus,"" said Rita Pin Ahrens, the organization's national executive director.
""Schools are responsible for the safety of all students and need to recognize these fears around coronavirus are manifesting in the classroom and must be addressed before more children are victimized and harmed,"" Pin Ahrens said.",4512
Washington under fire for labeling coronavirus,"Liu Yinmeng; Chen, Weihua",Others,2020-03-23,"As the coronavirus continues to spread in the United States, the Trump administration is fielding criticism from some public health officials, politicians and Asian Americans for labeling the illness a ""Chinese virus"", a term that experts argued is inaccurate and has led to increased incidents of racist attacks against Asians of different ethnicities.
""The president of the United States, and other White House officials, using the term 'Chinese virus', or 'Kung-Flu', or 'Wuhan virus', we believe is inciting and provoking this anti- Asian sentiment and is really responsible in the rise of these more violent acts,"" said Cynthia Choi, co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, a community-based civil rights organization in San Francisco.
""He's refusing to call it by its correct medical name, which is COVID-19, or the coronavirus. He's refusing to do that, even after it was called to his attention that this is harming and endangering the lives of Asian Americans,"" she added.
As of Sunday, 201 deaths and over 15,200 cases had been reported in the US, according to the World Health Organization.
In response to the increasingly frequent harassment resulting from the coronavirus, Choi's organization, along with the Asian Pacific Policy & Planning Council and the San Francisco State University's Asian American Studies Department, have launched a reporting center to track cases of discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders throughout the country.
The center opened on Thursday, and by Friday, it had already received 60 reports of cases from community members on the site, Choi said.
One of the cases involves a 12-year-old Asian American boy in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles, who was so badly beaten by middle school classmates that he had to visit the hospital emergency room.
Another case occurred just a few days ago. It revolved around a Chinese woman who found herself accosted on the street by a stranger who cursed at her and blamed her for bringing the coronavirus to the US.
On March 14, a man from Myanmar and his young son were two of four people stabbed by a man at a grocery store in Midland, Texas. Although this case still warrants further investigation, Choi said she found out through her network that racism and coronavirus motivated the attack.
""We are starting to see a pattern that individuals who might not appear to be likely to defend themselves, or unable to defend themselves, are being targeted. We are seeing all kinds of racially derogatory comments being made toward people,"" she added.
The violence has spiraled so out of hand that David Liu, the owner of Arcadia Firearm & Safety in San Gabriel Valley, an area with a high concentration of Chinese immigrants, said gun sales at his store were 10 times the usual amount in the past three weeks, with many customers buying firearms to protect themselves against possible racial attacks and fear of social disorder caused by the coronavirus.
Trump defended his use of the term on Wednesday, saying ""it's not racist at all"", he told reporters. ""It comes from China, that is why.""
However, cases of a strange, severe pneumonia were witnessed last November in Italy before the world even became aware of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, said Giuseppe Remuzzi, an Italian physician.
In an interview with National Public Radio, Remuzzi said some family doctors told him that they had seen the pneumonia, particularly in old people, in December and even in November.
""It means that the virus was circulating at least in Lombardy before we were aware of this outbreak occurring in China.""
Meanwhile, such terms have elicited a chorus of criticism from public figures, including former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who argued that Trump is using racist rhetoric to distract from his administration's delay in preparing the country for the pandemic.
""The president is turning to racist rhetoric to distract from his failures to take the coronavirus seriously early on, make tests widely available, and adequately prepare the country for a period of crisis. Don't fall for it. Don't let your friends and families fall for it,"" she wrote on her Twitter account on Wednesday.
Analysts outside the US also believe that Trump's intentional use of the racist term is to distract the US public from the wide criticism of his missteps in his early denial of the seriousness of the pandemic. Now with the stock market gains of the past three years totally wiped out, he is eager to play the blame game, especially in a presidential election
year.
Shada Islam, director of Europe and Geopolitics of Friends of Europe, a think tank in Brussels, Belgium, said at times of crisis like the one the world is living through, it is time for leaders and people to come together and work together to tackle the challenge, not exchange insults, accusations and engage in conspiracy theories.
""It is a tragedy that US-China tensions, dating back to US President Donald Trump's arrival at the White House, are further complicating global cooperation to surmount the pandemic,"" she said.
World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the use of the name COVID-19 is to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing. He and other WHO leaders have repeatedly warned against stigmatization in the past two months.
Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told The New York Times that the use of such terms ""can't but be interpreted as xenophobic and tinged with racist overtones"", given the Trump administration's long record of statements and actions on immigration, immigrants and issues of race.
Comedian Joe Wong and basketball player Jeremy Lin took to social media to speak up against the recent waves of harassment targeting Asian people.
""My AsAm friends told me last year, 'I know it's scary but as long as you stay in the two coasts (in the US), you are fine.' Now Asians are being assaulted in NYC, LA, London, and Australia. Asians have been enduring racism and now it's downright brutality,"" Wong wrote on Twitter.

Trump brushes off 'kung-flu' remark and claims Asian Americans would agree with calling it the 'Chinese coronavirus',"Choi, David",Others,2020-03-18,"President Donald Trump said he did not believe the term ""kung-flu"" and other discriminatory phrases would put Asian Americans at risk of xenophobic attacks amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The disparaging term was privately used by a White House official to CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang, a Chinese American, on Tuesday morning. ""I wonder who said that,"" Trump said to reporters at the White House on Wednesday. ""You know who said that? Say the term again.""
Trump said he did not believe Asian Americans would be negatively affected by the use of the phrase.
President Donald Trump said he did not believe the term ""kung-flu"" and other discriminatory phrases would put Asian Americans at risk of xenophobic attacks amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The disparaging term was privately used by a White House official to CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang, a Chinese American, on Tuesday morning.
""Makes me wonder what they're calling it behind my back,"" Jiang said in a tweet.
Trump pressed for more details when he was asked if he believed Asian Americans could be subjected to increased racist attacks because of similar terms. ""I wonder who said that,"" Trump said to a reporter at the White House on Wednesday. ""You know who said that? Say the term again.""
After the reporter repeated the phrase, it was still not clear if Trump understood the belittling implication and the relationship it has with Asians.
Trump said he did not believe Asian Americans would be negatively affected by the use of the phrase, which he said had to do with coronavirus' origins in China. Trump and numerous Republican lawmakers have described the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus,"" based on the initial cases in the country. Critics — including the Chinese government — have urged them not to use the term.
""No, not at all,"" Trump said. ""I think they'd probably would agree with it 100%. It comes from China. There's nothing not to agree on.""
Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, testified in a congressional hearing earlier in March that he agreed it was inappropriate to describe the virus as the ""Chinese coronavirus"" because it had spread across the world.
""Public health emergencies ... are stressful times for people and communities,"" the CDC wrote on its website. ""Fear and anxiety about a disease can lead to social stigma toward people, places, or things.""
""For example, stigma and discrimination can occur when people associate a disease, such as COVID-19, with a population or nationality, even though not everyone in that population or from that region is specifically at risk for the disease,"" the CDC website said.
Several hate crimes and acts of discriminatory behavior against Asian Americans were documented across the US in recent weeks amid the coronavirus pandemic. An Asian man who declined to be identified alleged a 44-year-old man named Raoul Ramos screamed at him on Saturday for not wearing a mask while he was walking with his 10-year-old son in New York, the New York Post reported.
  ""The guy walked past us. That triggered him. He was screaming at us and said, 'Where the f--- is your mask?'"" the man said to the Post.
""You f---ing Chinese,"" Ramos said, according to the Post's police sources.
Ramos, who is accused of hitting the Asian man in the head before fleeing, was arrested.",3331
"Coronavirus: there's nothing funny about racism, Chinese-American stand-up Joe Wong says","Huang, Kristin",Others,2020-03-26,"US President Donald Trump's apparent decision to stop using xenophobic language in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic did not come a moment too soon for one Chinese- American comedian, who said the problem of racism against Asian people in the US was part of the nation's fabric.
Joe Wong, who moved to the US in the 1990s and completed a PhD in biochemistry at Rice University, Texas, in 2000 before moving on to a successful career in stand-up comedy, said Trump's repeated use of terms like ""Chinese virus"" was fairly typical of the prevailing attitude in the country.
""When I talk about racism against AsAms [Asian-Americans], people's attitude is 'not you too!' Anti-Asian racism is not even acknowledged as a thing,"" he said on Twitter. ""Asian slurs are pretty well received at live comedy shows. It's so exhausting to fight it every time it happens.""
After a rise in the number of reports of physical and verbal attacks on Asian-Americans, Trump spoke out at a coronavirus task force news conference at the White House on Monday.
""They're amazing people and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape or form,"" he said.
Despite the tone of Trump's message, Wong said the language the president used was just another example of the division in American society. ""We Asians are referred to as 'they', and 'they' are not 'us',"" he said.
A study by San Francisco State University recently found a 50 per cent rise in the number of news articles related to the coronavirus and anti-Asian discrimination between February 9 and March 7.
Lead researcher Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian-American studies, said the figures represented ""the tip of the iceberg"" as only the most egregious cases would be likely to be reported.
He also said that a website written in six Asian languages he helped set up to gather first-hand accounts of racial abuse had received reports of 150 cases since going live last Thursday.
""Honestly I don't know how can you NOT be angry being an Asian in America now,"" Wong said on Twitter.
""My son grew up in America, I caught a glimpse of how racial slurs and gestures go around at schools and kindergartens. Yes, kindergartens,"" he said. ""What worries me is the fact that clearly those bullies didn't invent the slurs. They learned them from adults around them.""
Authorities in New York on Tuesday responded to the spike in assaults and harassment by opening a hotline to report hate crimes.
That came after E. Tendayi Achiume, the United Nations special rapporteur on racism, mentioned Trump by name in an appeal for governments around the world to stamp out xenophobia in policies and messaging.
""It's dismaying to witness state officials - including the President of the United States - adopting alternative names for the Covid-19 coronavirus,"" she said.
C.N. Le, director of the Asian & Asian-American Studies Certificate programme at the University of Massachusetts, said phrases like ""Chinese virus"" played into deeply ingrained stereotypes.
""That term plays off of old racist and xenophobic stereotypes of Asians in general, and Chinese in particular, as filthy, uncivilised, subhuman and, ultimately, inferior to whites and incompatible with the national American identity,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Wang Yuan, a Chinese student at Northwestern University in Illinois, said she was trying to play her part in fighting Covid-19 by drumming up financial and other support from the Chinese community.
""To combat the pandemic and Sinophobia, Chinese across the States have devoted themselves to monetary/medical supplies donations for hospitals running short of protective gear,"" she said. ""[But] this is not only about any specific racial group's self interest. This is about how we should act in solidarity to combat the pan-demic at this
Wong said it was vital for Asian-Americans from all walks of life to stand up to xenophobia and racism. ""I don't blame Asian-Americans who don't speak up, because they have enough on their plates. They have their jobs, they have work to deal with, and to make things worse, a lot of people work with or for a racist,"" he said.
""[But] a lot of Asian elites don't speak up because they have other interests to protect. That's why I started to talk about this on Twitter, because someone has to.""",4281
Chinese Americans fear spike in racism: Activists and politicians decry 'Chinese virus' label,"Warikoo, Niraj",Others,2020-03-20,"
At a news conference Wednesday, Trump defended his use of the phrase when asked by reporters if he was being bigoted in saying ""Chinese virus.""
""It's not racist at all,"" Trump said to reporters. ""No, not at all. It comes from China. That's why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate.""
Like many others, Chinese Americans in metro Detroit are anxious about the spread of coronavirus, but they and others of Asian descent are also worried about racist backlash.
""People are afraid,"" Shenlin Chen, said president of the Association of Chinese Americans (ACA), a group based in Madison Heights that advocates for Chinese Americans. ""People have fear about being discriminated against or treated unfairly.""
Since the spread of the coronavirus, there have been reports of Chinese Americans and other Asian American groups perceived to be Chinese being racially attacked or ostracized. In metro Detroit two weeks ago, an elderly Chinese American had his grocery cart spat on by someone, Chen said.
And now, they're concerned this week about how President Donald Trump is increasingly using the phrase ""Chinese virus"" in his tweets and public remarks. Founded in 1972, the Association of Chinese Americans was expected to release a statement on Thursday criticizing Trump and others who use that phrase.
""As it is plainly clear, there is no reason to attach a racial or ethnic or country moniker on a virus pandemic,"" a draft copy of the statement reads. ""The Covid-19 is present in all of the 50 states of the United States, is prevalent throughout Europe, the Americas, and Asia. Covid-19 does not recognize political borders. ... Attaching a racial, ethnic, or country name to a virus, even informally, serves only to flame the fears and biases of people against Chinese and those of Asian background to no benefit in the battle against the virus pandemic.""
The statement added: ""We should all work to avoid the misleading terms that detract from our common interest in working to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.""
On Wednesday, Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a tweet that ""Trump is attempting to incite hatred, violence and discrimination against Chinese Americans. We won't tolerate it in Michigan. Report all suspected hate crimes to your local police dept or to our Hate Crimes Unit. 313-456-0200.""
State Sen. Stephanie Chang, D-Detroit, tweeted on Wednesday: ""Just a little reminder to not discriminate, attack, or promote hate during #COVID2019. The virus is a virus. It does not have a race or ethnicity.""
On Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote on Twitter: ""Bigotry against people of Asian descent is unacceptable, un-American, & harmful to our COVID-19 response efforts."" Hillary Clinton called Trump's remarks ""racist rhetoric"" and Joe Biden slammed them as ""xenophobic fear-mongering.""
At a news conference Wednesday, Trump defended his use of the phrase when asked by reporters if he was being bigoted in saying ""Chinese virus."" ""It's not racist at all,"" Trump said to reporters. ""No, not at all. It comes from China. That's why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate.""
Also on Wednesday, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, made comments seen as racist when he said ""China is to blame because the culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that.""
There are about 61,000 residents in Michigan of Chinese ancestry, according to 2018 Census figures.
""There is a concern about how people react when we are in various establishments and crowds,"" said Northville attorney Roland Hwang, secretary of the Association of Chinese Americans and a teacher of Asian American studies at the University of Michigan.
The 1982 murder of Vincent Chin, of Chinese descent, in Highland Park by autoworkers angry at Japanese people the integration of the workforce, is still remembered by many Asian Americans in metro Detroit.
They're worried about any resurgence of anti-Asian racism.
Hwang helped found American Citizens for Justice, an Asian American advocacy group in metro Detroit created after Chin's murder to bring justice for Chin and raise awareness of anti-Asian racism.
""I'm really alarmed by Trump calling the virus a Chinese virus,"" Hwang said. ""There is no geographic, political subdivision, racial or ethnic limitation with respect to the virus.""
In addition to the issue of racism, the Chinese American community is grappling with the effects of the coronavirus spread. Linguistic barriers is an issue for some, which the Association of Chinese Americans is trying to help with, Chen said.

""I'm not a very reactive person,"" McDonald said. ""I don't process it, I'm not expecting it, I'm not waiting for someone to say something like that.""
That is changing in the era of the coronavirus pandemic. Advocacy organizations around the United States worry the health crisis will stoke bias and discrimination against Americans who immigrated from Asian countries as well as those of Asian descent.
Incidents of hate and violence have spiked so much that the website Teaching Tolerance has dedicated a section to teaching students how to speak up against racism related to coronavirus. And the organization Chinese for Affirmative Action now tracks assaults via voluntary reporting on its website.
Hundreds of cases have been recorded. Thousands more, particularly those occurring on social media, continue unabated. It is a reality McDonald and her family are now forced to accept.
Concerns also surged to the forefront of national conversations after President Donald Trump's statements and tweets labeling the illness as the ""Chinese virus."" A White House official also reportedly called the virus the ""kung-flu"" while a Republican lawmaker referred to it as the ""Wuhan flu.""
The end result, intended or not, has filtered down to Main Street America.
""I realize I have to start almost being mentally prepared for that so I can react,"" McDonald said.
Nancy Norton, McDonald's mother, said she is shocked by the behavior of people in her own community. She said she now fears for her daughter's safety.
""She's not allowed to go out without me or her sister shadowing her,"" Norton said. ""If something happens, they are going to have to get through us first.""
Reports of assaults on Asian-Americans have been documented worldwide since January, as the flu spread far beyond its place of origin in China. But they spiked after Trump began using nicknames for the virus that implied Chinese people were somehow to blame, said John C. Yang, executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-AAJC.
""We're now getting somewhere between five to six reports a day,"" Yang said. ""These incidents are not just verbal, but include physical assaults.""
On Monday, after being pressed by the White House press corps about criticism by advocacy groups about his use of the term ""Chinese flu,"" Trump conceded that verbal taunts, slurs and violence toward Asian-Americans are unacceptable.
Trump later tweeted: ""It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world. They are amazing people, and the spreading of the Virus ...... is NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form. They are working closely with us to get rid of it. WE WILL PREVAIL TOGETHER!"" he wrote in a series of tweets.
But the president did not back down from his use of the term, nor did he accept responsibility for spurring stigmatization of Asian-Americans in using it.
For those on the front lines of the fight against racism, Trump's condemnation of bias toward Asian-Americans provided little solace.
""We think it is better late than never that he spoke out against violence against Asian-American's, but it is unfortunate that it took him so long to do so,"" Yang said.
The coronavirus outbreak, which began several months ago in Wuhan, China, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11. And as rapidly as it spread across the United States, so did misinformation and ignorance. Slanderous terms by an administration long accused of xenophobia soon followed.
""Using terms like ‘Chinese virus' does have a stigmatizing effect,"" Yang said. ""It fuels prejudice because it's based on the misperception that Chinese Americans are responsible for the virus or are somehow special carriers or transmitters of the virus, none of which we know are true.""
Trump has denied the term ""Chinese virus"" is racist, instead calling it a statement of fact. But nothing could be further from the truth for those suffering the consequences of bigotry invoked by such words, Yang said.
At McDonald's West Palm Beach school, Alexander W. Dreyfoos School of the Arts, another Chinese-American student said she was verbally assaulted by a classmate whom she previously considered a friend.
""Everyone knows Chinese people are disgusting,"" she reported the antagonist saying. ""They'll eat any kind of animal. They're dirty.""
The hurtful comments are but a sampling of what some have endured as a result of coronavirus-related aggression. People have been punched, kicked and spit-on, according to numerous media reports.
The impact of such assaults affects not only those involved in the confrontations but those who witness them.
""Unfortunately, these events have caused all of us in these difficult times to be further isolated from each other,"" Yang said. ""There have been stories of good bystanders that have intervened, and that has helped people feel more unified. But, absolutely, the effect of these events is that it makes everyone feel less safe.""
Rui Falcon, secretary and treasurer of the Chinese Association of Science, Economics and Culture of South Florida, hopes that the work her organization is doing to combat the threat of coronavirus will help people realize that citizens of all ethnicities are equally important members of the community.
""This country is a melting pot, and it has been super successful in productivity and is the strongest country in the world,"" she said. ""That's an indirect result of embracing many different cultures.""
Falcon's organization has been distributing face masks to the elderly and plans to donate 3,000 more face masks and 120 bottles of hand sanitizer to local hospitals this week. ""We would like to contribute very positively to fight against the virus with everybody in the community,"" she said.
The group began sourcing much-needed medical supplies to send to China early in the crisis. Now, they are donating supplies locally to help protect medical personnel who are treating infected patients.
Falcon finds reports of assaults on Chinese-Americans troubling and says everyone is facing the same frustrations and uncertainty.
""There's so much negativity here, because people are in fear,"" she said. ""The market is dropping, they're losing a lot of money, they are losing their jobs, and there is a tremendous amount of anger over death and illness.""
But instead of division, Falcon said now is the time for all Americans to work together to fight coronavirus.
""We're one of you,"" she said. ""We're all in this together. That is my main message. We all must work together -- we're a team."" Palm Beach Post staff reporter Tom D'Angelo contributed to this story.",7224
Hollywood slams coronavirus-related racism toward Asian Americans,"Carras, Christi",Others,2020-03-21,"Daniel Dae Kim, Lana Condor, Mark Ruffalo, Henry Golding, George Takei, Celeste Ng and Jonathan Van Ness are among Hollywood stars who are taking to social media to denounce racism toward Asian Americans fuelled by the coronavirus outbreak.
Kim, the ‘Lost’ and ‘Hawaii Five-0’ star, shed a light on the issue before and after revealing he tested positive for COVID-19. Prior to his Thursday announcement video, Kim explained on Twitter that he had originally been “silent in the face of the blatant acts of racism against Asian people” because “there have been so many it’s been too heartbreaking to comment on.”
Later going public with his diagnosis, Kim had a message for anyone using the pandemic as an excuse to aim hatred at people of Asian descent.
“Please, please stop the prejudice and senseless violence against Asian people,” he said in a video, calling out “certain political leaders,” such as President Donald Trump, who have falsely dubbed the illness the “Chinese virus.”
“Randomly beating elderly — sometimes homeless — Asian Americans is cowardly, heartbreaking, and it’s inexcusable. Yes, I’m Asian, and yes, I have coronavirus, but I did not get it from China ... I don’t consider the place where it’s from as important as the people who are sick and dying.”
‘To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before’ star Condor also appeared to slam Trump indirectly on Twitter Wednesday while urging her followers to “be safe.”
“You have no idea the ramifications your racist words & actions have on the Asian American community,” she wrote. “You simply cannot even fathom the danger you are putting the community in. How dare you. You should be ashamed of yourself. You call yourself a leader?
“Please. Be better. So we aren’t afraid to leave our house in fear someone will verbally or physically abuse us because of your xenophobia.”
Addressing his thoughts directly to Trump, ‘Avengers’’alum Ruffalo also challenged the president to “do better” when speaking on the public health crisis.
“When you blame a virus on an entire race of people, you turn people against them,” he tweeted. “When you make these unscientific political statements, some of your followers begin to act violently and in exclusionary, xenophobic ways against these people.”
‘Crazy Rich Asians’ breakout star Golding added his voice to the chorus on Friday, insisting “the virus really doesn’t care where you come from.”
“Using dangerous rhetoric to incite racism isn’t what is needed right now,” he tweeted. “The virus ... is unbiased to all. Stand up for each other in these dark times, it’s the only way we are going to make it out on the other end.”
As part of a new #WashTheHate campaign — aimed at combating “the rising tide of coronavirus-related discrimination and violence against individuals of Asian descent” — ‘Mulan’ actor Tzi Ma also shared a PSA on social media.
“We act out of our fears by wearing masks, hoarding supplies, and sadly, some of lash out at Asian Americans as if Asian Americans were responsible for this virus, just for being of Asian descent,” he said while scrubbing his hands in a minute-long clip. “Stop it. Acts of violence against Asian Americans will not stop the spread of this virus. So the next time you wash your hands, wash out the hate that you may have for your fellow Americans. Hate will get you sick, even if the virus doesn’t.”",3348
McConnell silent on 'Chinese virus' term: Some Asian Americans outraged at Trump using it,"Trump, Donald J; McConnell, Mitch",Others,2020-03-29,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has had no problem denouncing critics in the past who have blown an anti-Asian dog whistle.
Which is why On Politics asked the senator's office this week what he thought of President Donald Trump using the term ""China virus"" or ""Chinese virus"" in remarks about COVID-19.
""Our country is in the midst of a health and economic challenge,"" said McConnell spokeswoman Stephanie Penn.
I was reminded by Penn how — as majority leader — McConnell is spearheading a bold and comprehensive package to deliver relief for Kentuckians.
""This isn't the time for petty squabbling, but for every American to come together to do their part,"" Penn concluded.
Asian American advocacy organizations and other researchers don't have firm figures, but they point to a hike in reports about verbal threats and physical assaults targeting their minority group.
A report by San Francisco State University, for example, cited that there was an uptick in reports of discrimination against Asian Americans in the ""form of shunning, harassment and physical assaults.""
Zhizhi ""Wit"" Wang, who lives in Lexington, said Trump's hurtful language shouldn't be dismissed by McConnell as ""petty squabbling."" ""I think it's a racist comment,"" he said. ""We would never call Ebola the 'African virus.'""
The 25-year-old University of Kentucky graduate student, who is studying finance, immigrated to the U.S. more than a decade ago. He said Chinese Americans and other Kentuckians of Asian descent feel they are being blamed for a global pandemic.
Wang said he hasn't heard about any violence or verbal threats in Lexington, which has an Asian population of less than 4%, according to census data. But he is troubled by the national headlines coming from parts of the country where more Asian Americans live.
The Kentuckian pleaded with McConnell and others to think about the consequences of Trump's language.
""What is the difference if you just call it coronavirus versus 'Chinese virus?'"" Wang asked. ""He could have avoided this entire mess but he did not choose to do so.""
McConnell certainly didn't bite his tongue when past players in Kentucky politics have used this race card to animate their attacks against him.
During the 2014 Senate campaign, a liberal super PAC called Progress Kentucky alluded to his wife Elaine Chao — who now serves as Trump's transportation secretary — and her Chinese background when criticizing McConnell about letting U.S. jobs move overseas.
The McConnell campaign fired back quickly at the time, and blasted the group for ""race-baiting"" voters. It did the same when a Democratic consultant referred to Chao, who came to the U.S. from China as a child, as being Asian and not a native Kentuckian.
Team Mitch had zilch to say when asked about Trump's ""Chinese virus"" comments this week, even as old foes acknowledge the mistake.
""The senator and secretary were on the right side of history in calling out Progress Kentucky's racist tweets, just as I was on the wrong side for trivializing the harm they caused,"" said Curtis Morrison, an attorney and former Progress Kentucky volunteer. ""It is sad to watch now as they tolerate the same racism when it comes from the president.""
Morrison figures Trump is just too powerful and too important for McConnell to criticize in public.
The GOP leader didn't refrain from calling out Republican Everett Corley two years ago when it was discovered the small-time state legislative candidate appeared on a white nationalist radio show where the host criticized McConnell's interracial marriage.
""This racist behavior is completely despicable,"" McConnell said in 2018. ""Such backwards views and hateful rhetoric must be given no corner in the Republican Party or anywhere in America.""
Pandemic challenges underdogs
Senate Democratic candidates Charles Booker and Mike Broihier were already long shots in the primary battle against presumed front-runner Amy McGrath, and the COVID-19 pandemic gives them a new hurdle.
Across the country, lesser-known candidates are having to ditch door-knocking and direct voter contact. But Booker and Broihier argue the pandemic only changes how people can support them as they shift to the digital realm.
Booker, a state legislator from Louisville, is taking a family-friendly approach while still delivering body blows to McConnell's leadership.
""If you're stuck in the house like we are, why not have a dance party!"" Booker said in a Wednesday tweet featuring a video with one of his two daughters. ""I know this is a tough time for all of us. So much fear, so much uncertainty. While we fight to weather this time, my hope is that you can still find joy in the little things. My girls do that for me!""
Booker branded himself early as a candidate fueled by grassroots progressives who understood his personal story as a Type 1 diabetic who lost his cousin to gun violence. The virus is forcing him to campaign remotely at a time when close contact with voters and large rallies are discouraged or outright forbidden.
""This movement has always been about meeting people where they are and breaking down barriers to getting involved,"" Booker said in a news release announcing the decision. ""That is what has set our campaign apart to date, and the steps we are taking now are just further proof of our commitment to disrupting the status quo and elevating the voices of every Kentuckian.""
Broihier, a retired Marine, is taking advantage by having a nightly online program at 7 across all social media platforms broadcast from his Lincoln County farm.
The program features union leaders, grassroots organizers and average Kentuckians who want to air their concerns.
Broihier also is running digital ads aimed at McConnell that are much fiercer than any Booker or McGrath have aired.
""Only the fear of losing his reelection got 'Corona Mitch' to finally do the right by the American people,"" he said in a March 19 tweet featuring a new online spot.
""If Mitch McConnell needs to be scared to finally do his job, then I'll keep him scared for the next eight months,"" Broihier added. ""And then we'll beat him.""
What Booker and Broihier are losing out on, however, are chances at candidate forums or debates to contrast with McGrath, who is acting as if there is no primary election at all. Many of those events have been canceled, with little chance of rescheduling before the new June 23 primary date.
""A lot of people — even if they have the money — they are not doing the things that they otherwise would have done because they are limiting their lives,"" said University of Kentucky political science professor Stephen Voss.
What to watch, Voss said, is if skittish Americans will respond to any call for civic engagement as COVID-19 continues to lock down the country.
""You're focusing on 'Do they have the money?' I'd also focus on 'Do they want to go to the post office?'"" he said. ""Insofar as people are hunkering down, it pulls them away from any kind of public mindedness.""
The Booker campaign, however, sees an opportunity to awaken Kentuckians about their liberal platform, which demands structural change whether as a Green New Deal, universal basic income or ""Medicare for All.""
""The pandemic has made it clear: We need a government that takes care of us,"" Colin Lauderdale, who is Booker's campaign manager, told supporters in an online letter. ""And to have that, we need a senator who will fight for us. If that's what you want, then join us. From at least six feet away.""

Racial harassment reported,"STEECKER, MATT",Others,2020-03-20,"""These are challenging times for everyone, and we need to band together, not harass or discriminate anyone of any culture in regards to what is happening now.""
Dennis Nayor
Ithaca police chief
As the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Tompkins County have increased to six, Ithaca officials are also dealing with a possible rise in prejudice toward Asians and Asian-Americans.
Cornell University officials first expressed concerns last month in a statement telling the college community to ""not make assumptions about others' perceived symptoms or any characteristics of identity"" when students were tested for COVID-19 and isolated before the results came back negative.
While no positive cases were confirmed at the time at Cornell, two members of the Ithaca College community have since tested positive in the past week.
Ithaca Mayor Svante Myrick said Wednesday he heard two direct accounts of acts of verbal harassment directed at an Asian person and an Asian-American. He also said a third party told him of another incident in which someone verbally assaulted another individual.
Myrick said these type of incidents will be investigated by the City of Ithaca if they are reported, but Ithaca Police Chief Dennis Nayor said not all of the previous incidents were reported.
In the City of Ithaca, 17.6% of the population identifies as Asian, according to 2017 U.S. Census data. Of the 5,406, 9% are Chinese. Much of the large Asian population is tied to the local colleges.
The coronavirus pandemic traces back to Wuhan, China, where it was discovered late last year. Its origin has led President Donald Trump to label the pathogen the ""Chinese virus"" and the disease the ""Wuhan flu,"" which has led to strong criticism because experts say this rhetoric empowers racism.
""I sent the message (Tuesday) because we have to nip it in the bud,"" said Myrick, who said harassment directed toward those of Asian descent increased from zero to at least three this week.
""(Wednesday), Trump tweeted 'Chinese coronavirus.' He's attempting to rebrand it by calling it the Chinese virus even though there's no reason to do so.
""He's trying to deflect blame. He thinks if we attach an ethnicity to the virus, (his response to COVID-19) will not change the election. This is an irresponsible, horrible form of politics that's never been seen before. Labeling an entire ethnicity with a disease has led to the biggest atrocities and genocides.""
Myrick shared a message on Facebook condemning the acts of prejudice and Trump's rhetoric.
The mayor has advised residents to share messages stating the Ithaca community will not tolerate hate. He suggested residents can do so with signs and on social media.
""Make your own message that racism and hate in this moment is the very last thing we need, and it won't be allowed or tolerated in the City of Ithaca,"" Myrick said in the video.
Tompkins County Legislator Chair Leslyn McBean-Clairborne shared similar sentiments at Tuesday's legislature meeting.
Clairborne said, ""Please be sensitive. Stop that behavior, and if you see it ... interrupt it and provide support to those being harassed.""
Racism toward Asian people has increased throughout the country recently, with metro areas such as Dallas-Fort Worth and Seattle reporting more incidents.
Ithaca police aware of harassment
During the incidents in Ithaca, the individuals were followed, and comments about coronavirus and COVID-19 were directed toward them.
""This is not just occurring in different places around the country,"" Nayor said by phone. ""It is occurring locally as well. ... we won't tolerate that.
""These are challenging times for everyone, and we need to band together, not harass or discriminate anyone of any culture in regards to what is happening now.""
Naylor also sent an email to the city police department, telling his staff to ""be cognizant of any biased-based crimes which may occur as a result of what is going on internationally.""
""As we are navigating the COVID-19, we may be likely to see more incidents like this perpetrated against members of our Asian community, so please be alert to that and let's do all we can to address any concerns that are brought forward,"" the email said.
The Tompkins County Sheriff's Office has not reported any complaints, but Sheriff Derek Osborne is aware of the recent incidents in the city.
""I think it's during times like these that we need to pull together as a community in support of one another rather than allow fear to drive a wedge between us,"" he said.
How some are discriminating against Asians
Robert Ji-Song Ku, of the Department of Asian and Asian American Studies at Binghamton University, emphasized the harm that can come when ethnic groups are blamed irrationally or used as a scapegoat during the confusing and difficult times.
Ji-Song Ku said hostile behaviors toward these populations are increasing and include: Minor microaggressions.
Leering looks.
Outright racist behavior such as calling the virus ""Chinese virus"" or ""Wuhan virus.""
He said the restaurant industry has experienced an overall downturn in business regardless of the type of food served, and it appears that Chinese restaurants suffered disproportionately.
""This is true for not only major Asian enclaves, such as Chinatowns in New York City and San Francisco, but also in areas with smaller Asian-American populations, such as the Southern Tier of New York,"" Ji-Song Ku said.
Myrick expressed faith that residents will unite and stomp out hate.
""Yes, it will be more necessary,"" he said. ""It will be a confusing time. Entire professions will disappear. We will have to build a new social safety net and a new way to relate to each other.""",5687
"Professor, Nevada activist discuss anti-Asian hate","Corona, M. ",Others,2021-03-25,"The fatal shooting of eight people at Asian-operated spas in Atlanta has highlighted growing anti-Asian American sentiment that many experts have been worrying about since the start of the pandemic.
Discrimination against Asians and Asian-Americans has flourished throughout history, dating back to past immigration laws, intervention wars and military occupations in various Asian countries, said Meredith Oda, historian and associate professor at the University of Nevada, Reno.
""I think if we look at what he targeted—three Asian massage parlors, often with Asian women working there— if we put it into context, it makes a lot of sense,"" Oda said of the suspected gunman, Robert Aaron Long, of Woodstock, Georgia.
Amy Koo, deputy political director for One APIA Nevada and a former Reno resident, said the Silver State has its own history of racism against Asian Americans. She's seen a rise in discrimination and violence against the Asian American community in Las Vegas over the last year.
She said the gunman's motive for the shootings in Atlanta raises the assumption that all Asian-run massage parlors are operating illicitly, which isn't always the case.
""These are immigrant women who are just trying to provide for their families,"" Koo said.
Investigators said the gunman opened fire at Young's Asian Massage in Acworth, Georgia on March 16, killing four people and injuring a fifth. He then drove 30 miles to Atlanta and killed four more people at two other spas.
In Acworth, the victims included Delaina Ashley Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Tan and Daoyou Feng. Soon Chung Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim and Yong Ae Yue were identified Friday by the Fulton County Medical Examiner's office as the four victims of the shootings at two spas in Atlanta.
The lone shooting victim who survived the attack, Elcias Hernandez-Ortiz, was hospitalized in intensive care. Authorities have said the gunman was headed to Florida to carry out more shootings at spas there.
The man reportedly told investigators he attacked the spas because he wanted to ""eliminate"" the temptation to feed his sexual compulsion. He is facing a total of eight murder charges and one count of assault in connection to all three shootings, USA Today reported.
The case has drawn attention to how hate crimes are defined, and a House panel will hold a hearing today addressing the rise in anti-Asian American hate and discrimination. An anti-hate crime bill is likely to come up during the hearing as lawmakers consider their response to the rise in hate.
Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) has joined bicameral legislation introduced by Sen. Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) to address the rise of hate crimes and violence targeted at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act would create a Department of Justice position to expedite the review of COVID-19-related hate crimes, provide support for state and local law enforcement to respond to hate crimes as well as work with local and federal partners to mitigate racially discriminatory language used to describe the pandemic, Cortez Masto's office announced this week.
""The violence and harassment Asian and Pacific Islander Americans have experienced over the past year is deeply disturbing and we must work together to combat hate and ensure that all perpetrators are brought to justice,"" she said in a prepared statement.
Oda said Asian women have long been the targets of violence, and they have been sexualized and fetishized in American culture. She doesn't believe the shooting was an isolated incident.
""We can't understand things as blips or weird, unique, one-off events, but rather they're a part of systematic inequalities and ... racial oppressions,"" she said in a recent interview with the Reno Gazette Journal.
Understanding the history
According to Stop AAPI Hate, a group that tracks acts of discrimination and xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, an estimated 3,800 incidents of hate, discrimination or attacks on Asian Americans have been reported from March 2020 through February 2021. That's compared to roughly 100 incidents annually in previous years, according to a USA Today report.
""That AAPI report noted that Asian-American women made up about two-thirds of those documented incidents,"" Oda said, adding that many go unreported.
Oda said Asian-Americans have experienced rejection since the Chinese Exclusion Act, which suspended the immigration of Chinese laborers for a period of 10 years. Signed into law in 1882, it was the first act to place broad restrictions on immigration, according to the U.S. Office of the Historian.
The Page Law, passed in 1875, also targeted primarily Chinese women brought to the U.S. for ""immoral purposes,"" according to Immigration and Ethnic History Society—a nonprofit organization based in Minnesota that promotes the study of immigration history.
""From the start, Asian laws excluded women specifically in these sexualized terms,"" Oda said.
Eventually, the U.S. established military bases in the Pacific and in Asia. Cities then ""popped up"" around the military bases offering services to Americans based there, Oda said.
""That included bars, but that also includes sex work,"" Oda said. ""It's not like sex workers and prostitutes followed the (U.S.) Army. This kind of industry was created because of these military bases.""
She said many of those countries were devastated by war, referencing the Korean War, Vietnam War and the war against Japan following the attack on Pearl Harbor. Rape was common around military bases, she said, including among young girls.
""The local governments often had limited access to punish the service people, and often had an incentive to hush it up because so much rides on the continuation of American service people putting their money into these local communities via the bodies of these sex workers,"" Oda said.
When the U.S. drew back its troops, some of those women who operated sex parlors in their home countries immigrated to the U.S. and opened massage parlors, Oda said.
""It kind of helped to establish the idea of Asian women as desirable, but also willing and available, particularly to white American men,"" Oda said, adding many scholars found some massage parlors were rooted in camp towns.
Some operate legally, she said, but others allow women to work under the table.
Anti-Asian sentiments in Nevada
Koo, with One APIA Nevada, said understanding the history of the Asian-American communities is critical, particularly now.
Koo referenced the transcontinental railroad that connects Reno to Sacramento, which Chinese migrant workers helped build.
""The safety conditions of a lot of the workers were not very good,"" Koo said. ""After they completed the transcontinental railroad ... a lot of these Chinese laborers were kind of left to their own devices.
""And we actually saw a really vibrant Chinatown grow in Reno from the late 1800s to the early 1900s,"" she said.
But in the early 1900s, Chinatown was declared as a physical and moral threat, and the entire thing was demolished.
""That wasn't even the first time that Chinatown had been destroyed,"" Koo said. ""I believe in 1878, it had also been burned down by people who didn't want it there.""
Oda said the Trump Administration also helped create an anti-Asian American sentiment by referring to COVID-19 as the ""China flu,"" the ""Kung flu"" or the ""Wuhan virus.""
""It takes different shapes at different times, but this undercurrent very much has its roots,"" Oda said. ""There is definitely a racial and gender component to this, whether or not the police wish to acknowledge that.""
Setting a foundation
Oda said she believes that the Black Lives Matter movement laid down a foundation that's helping spread awareness of racial inequalities, discrimination and racism outside of the Black community.
She also acknowledged the Latinx communities, which have been organizing to fight the criminalization of migrants.
""I think it's allowed people more broadly to be amenable to the idea that Asian-Americans also face systematic racism,"" Oda said. ""It looks different to anti-Black or anti-Latinx bias, but nonetheless, there is a structural kind of anti-Asian sentiment there.""
Koo said acknowledging hate crimes when they happen is important because many of those communities are hurting.
""There was a sense of understanding that we can't keep quiet anymore,"" she said.

PROTESTING ASIAN HATE: Crowd in Nassau decries attacks that stoke fear,"Zou, D.",Others,2021-03-15,"Peter Au felt encouraged to see that hundreds showed up Sunday in Mineola to condemn the violent attacks that
have spread fear among the Asian American community.
Au, a financial adviser who commutes weekly to Flushing, Queens, for work, said he worries about his safety.
""On the way to my office even during broad daylight, I still feel the fear,"" said Au, 45, of Garden City, at the end
of the hourlong rally. ""I don't know if anybody was going to walk behind me and start attacking me.""
Just last month, a man came up behind a 36-year-old Asian man walking on a street in Manhattan's Chinatown
and stabbed him in the torso, leaving the victim hospitalized in critical condition.
""It's been a very, very tragic year in 2020. Not only did we have to fight COVID-19, as a minority living in this
country we also had to fight racism,"" Au said. ""I'm glad that there's a huge turnout today and see so many
different groups supporting us.""
The rally held outside the Nassau County Legislative Building drew about 300 attendees, many of whom held up
signs that said ""END VIOLENCE AGAINST ASIANS"" and ""Justice for Grandpa VICHA,"" the first name of Vicha
Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thai man who died in January after being slammed onto the pavement in San Francisco. Ratanapakdee's death was one of the violent assaults that ignited a national outcry over the
discrimination and harassment that some Asian Americans said they've endured since the pandemic began.
President Joe Biden in a nationally televised speech last Thursday condemned violence against Asian Americans.
""One year later today, we already have the vaccines for the virus, but the hate and crime against Asian
Americans are still running out of control,"" said Gordon Zhang, president of the Long Island Chinese American
Association.
In an emotional speech, Zhang evoked the history of minorities being ""scapegoated"" in times of crisis, pointing
to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the Japanese internment camps during World War II.
""But today, it's not the 1880s. It's not the 1940s. We are in the year of 2021,"" Zhang said. ""We can't have the
ugly and painful history repeat itself again.""
After recounting several attacks in recent months, Zhang said the reported cases only represent ""the tip of the
iceberg"" as many incidents go unreported - something acknowledged by Nassau Police Commissioner Patrick
Ryder.
""I know there have been many that have not been reported because people are fearful,"" Ryder said. ""They
should come forward. We want you to know that your police officers, the men and women that stand out here to
protect you today, took an oath to protect and serve.""
The crowd occasionally broke into chants of ""stop the hate"" as elected officials as well as leaders from the
NAACP, Jewish and Muslim groups called for unity.
""We are not looking for any different way of treating us,"" said Sen. Kevin Thomas (D-Levittown), who arrived at
the United States at the age of 10. He is the state's first Indian American state senator. ""Just treat us the same
as everyone else.""
As Thomas and others spoke, Young Ono of Stewart Manor waved a ""#STOP ASIAN HATE"" sign along with her
daughter, Alexandra, 7, who held a second sign that said: ""HATE IS A VIRUS."" The mother of two wrote the
letters and her daughter and son Jayson, 3, decorated the signs with color-filled hearts and stars.
""Watching all these people getting hurt reminded me so much of my own parents and grandparents,"" said Ono,
whose parents emigrated from South Korea. ""It's important for me to show support and show my children that
it's important to show support for something like this.""
Harry Woodrow, 73, of Westbury, heard about the rally from his temple in Jericho. With friend Sharyn Levine,
they decided to come out to show solidarity.

"Balancing work, family and myself in the hour of Asian hate","Nagaishi, A.",Others,2021-03-21,"I was sitting at my desk when a student in front of me put up their hands and shot me.
The barrel of the gun was made up of the boy's two fleshy fingers and his thumb was the hammer that clicked down again and again as he spoke what passed for his language of gunfire loud enough to make the teacher glare at him.
It was make-believe. But this week, that memory felt a lot more real.
I was in the fifth grade during a history class learning about World War II, specifically about Pearl Harbor and the bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. I'd learn something else that day, too. Even though I lived in America, I spoke English and I was very much a part of this country, my peers wouldn't see past the fact that I was Japanese.
My birth was half a century removed from the war, but a piece of me feels like
I inherited some kind of responsibility. I feel sorry for the lives lost from the Pearl Harbor attack, and at the same time I feel sorry for my ancestors that had been ravaged by the atomic bombs and their effects.
I've come a long way and learned a lot from that day in elementary school.
Now, I'm 22 years old, and I'm writing about the nightmares you'd find in a history book. A gunman in Atlanta went on a killing spree that killed six Asians and two other people.
I woke up Wednesday to text messages from my colleagues and friends asking how I was doing. Next thing I saw on my phone was a headline about a shooter that killed eight people. I didn't make the connection at that moment.
I picked up my cat and said, ""Happy Birthday Soba!"" She purred into my chest, a creature comfort I had no idea I would need for rest of the day.
It happened in less than an hour.
Tensions across the country were high and I was driving home to make sure my mom was going to be okay. She is independent but I knew some moral support could help her.
I texted my mom, ""Be careful."" When I didn't get a text back I thought it would be best to play it safe and go home in case she needed me to be there for her.
Before I knew it, I had two stories on my hands and my foot on the gas pedal, heading from Staunton, Virginia, back to Ohio to be with my family after the attack.
It was stressful six-hour drive, full of phone calls, coordination and chaos.
It was a new experience to report on something that I could relate to intimately. I had no time to process my own feelings during the drive but was able to connect with the Asian community at my new home in Staunton in a way I never imagined I would.
We reflected on discrimination, family and fear.
We all had this fear of something happening not just to us, but our parents. We didn't want to let our moms out the door alone. All of a sudden, the biggest threat in my life wasn't COVID; now it was my own identity.
I began to question my own security when I got a text message from someone I know who gave me their address in case my safety was compromised where I lived because I was Asian.
Normal life had made me accustomed to the vulnerability of being a woman but this week's attack added an extra layer of anxiety onto my identity.
Journalism is no easy feat, especially doing it over the phone while driving down the road at 70 mph.
The highway was dark and the rain was pouring when I pulled up to my parent's house. My mom opening the front door felt like a relief, but I know there are family members across the country that people can never come home to.
Writing and reflecting on this week's act of hate was challenging, but it left me with something I didn't have before.
I had met other Asians in Staunton who mourned with me, shared their fears with me and looked toward a better and more loving future with me. I talked with my friend Anhthu who I've gotten to know recently and I felt that the conversation I had with her on the way to Ohio made us feel closer.
This period of our shared American history is going to mean different things for many different people.
It's a time for contemplation, time for anger or even forgiveness.
I know whatever I felt today is only a fraction of the destruction of the lives of the victims' families.
Asians in this country have been targeted before in horrific hate crimes and now my mom and I are afraid it won't be the last.
What will it take for this to be the time for change?

"Together, they fight the hate ; Queens' Main Street Patrol takes to streets amid rising violence against Asian-Americans","Roman, C., SingH, A., & Guse, C.",Others,2021-03-30,"Jin Ooi didn't think a volunteer patrol group in Flushing, Queens, would do much to stop the rise of hate crimes against Asian-Americans - until he became a target.
Ooi, 34, decided to join a civilian watch organization after attending a March 21 rally outside the Flushing library - five days after six Asian-American spa workers were killed in a mass shooting in the Atlanta area.
At the rally he met Teresa Ting, a 29-year-old actress who a month earlier formed a group called Main Street Patrol in response to the assault of an elderly Chinese woman in the neighborhood. The group now has about 60 members - including some retired cops - who volunteer on weekends to look out for their neighbors.
""We are there to be witnesses, to report crimes and let the cops do their jobs from there on,"" said Ting. ""It's frightening to me that someone can just harm the elderly in our communities.""
The NYPD so far this year has recorded 33 hate crimes against Asian-Americans around the city, two of them motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic - triple the 11 hate crimes against Asian-Americans during the same period last year, all of which cops said were related to the pandemic.
Ooi didn't realize the impact the patrol group would have.
""I felt it was good that there was that kind of presence to deter these attacks, but I didn't think this patrol would be actively deterring a hate crime,"" Ooi said.
His mind changed after he joined a neighborhood patrol hours after the rally.
As Ooi and other volunteers patrolled the area near the rally site, Ooi said he saw two men who appeared to be plotting an attack.
""One of them said, 'I'm going to hit that guy over the head with this,' "" Ooi said. ""I assume he's talking about hitting this elderly man sitting on the steps because he's pointing at him with this black bag that looks to have a bottle in it and gesturing to his back.""
The men began heckling Asian-American passersby, using slurs like ""ching chong,"" before moving toward the elderly man, Ooi said.
The patrol group sprung into action, forming a triangle around the pair of bigots, with one member stepping in to shield the elderly Asian man sitting on the steps. The move worked, and the men left.
But Ooi and a woman who was a Main Street Patrol volunteer 
followed the pair.
When the female volunteer began videotaping the men on her cell phone, one of the men went ""from zero to 100,"" Ooi said. The irate racist began threatening the woman, and five other volunteers rushed to her defense.
""I'm going to hurt somebody,"" Ooi said the man snarled. ""I'm going to f--k somebody up.""
Ooi said he then followed the men to an apartment building on Kissena Blvd. near 41st Ave., and recorded them through the front-door window after they went inside.
""One of the Main Street Patrol instructions is to document any events happening,"" said Ooi. ""They come back out once they notice I'm recording. One of them says, 'Why are you recording me, ching?' ""
The man slapped the Samsung Note cell phone out of Ooi's hand, causing it to smash against the ground. Police last week released video of the confrontation and said the NYPD's Hate Crime Task Force was investigating.
""After seeing all this happen under my nose in broad daylight and knowing there were more racially motivated incidents that day and that these guys are still at large, it [the patrol group] is definitely necessary,"" said Ooi. ""This wasn't just like a little prank or whatever. These people are threatening and doing actions that can kill somebody.""
The pandemic has correlated with a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, and Ooi lamented that national figures, including former President Donald Trump, dubbed the disease the ""China virus.""
""People are looking for a release to their rage and suffering and they want to blame somebody and take it out on someone, but targeting us makes no sense,"" said Ooi. ""I just want to keep people safe and aware that there are these dangers. We have to stop the bleeding first, both metaphorically and literally.""

Murder scars; Brooklyn nabe 'hero' killed while defending robbery victims,"Kriegstein, B., & Greene, L.",Others,2021-03-04,"Before coronavirus shut down businesses in Sunset Park and wiped away foot traffic along Seventh Ave., this
patch of Brooklyn was a safe spot, certainly not the kind of place where a man would get killed defending a
robbery victim, residents said.
But here they were Wednesday, friends, family, strangers, united in grief over two deaths: the killing of a Good
Samaritan trying to break up a fight outside a gambling den, and the demise of neighborhood safety and
relative peace of mind.
""I'm just kind of surprised that something happened here,"" said Chris Bittmann, 20, who works for New York
Life and moved to Sunset Park with his girlfriend a year ago because of its reputation for safety. ""The people
around here are good people. There's been a spike of crime during COVID, but it hadn't really reached this area.
I moved here because it was safe here.""
Shi Quan Lin, 28, has lived in the neighborhood 20 years. He can count on his thumbs the number of times he
has walked by a crime scene.
""We don't really have murders here,"" he said. ""Because of COVID, no one is really on the street so they see an
opportunity. Usually at that hour, there are tons of people walking around.""
The hour he referenced was the moment Friday night when the do-gooder, Yong Zheng, was stabbed to death
with a screwdriver during a wild caught-on-camera melee. Cops said Zheng was returning from dinner with
friends when they saw two groups of men fighting outside an illegal gambling den, and intervened.
Mourners filled the intersection where Zheng, 46, staggered across the street and finally collapsed, filling the
avenue with candles and white flowers. Crying family members kneeled beside a barricade that closed off traffic
and held pictures of a smiling man they called father, son and hero.
Jessica Gao, 38, a restaurant worker who has lived in Sunset Park for 15 years, said she didn't know Zheng, but
joined the crowd to pay her respects.
""He's a Chinese hero,"" Gao said. ""He tried to help the Chinese people, and the other people killed him. Now the
community is not safe at all. Our kids grow up here. It's not safe for our kids.""
Cops arrested William Smith, 45, of Brownsville, on Sunday and charged him with murder, robbery and assault.
Cops tracked him down after a witness took a picture of his license plate and gave it to police, sources said.
Local residents spoke of the rise in attacks in the city against Asian Americans, but police have not classified the
incident as a hate crime. The community agrees Zheng's death was a tragedy. Of that there is no dispute.
""Mr. Yong Zheng is a typical good Samaritan,"" said Yu Lin, a City Council candidate. ""He is someone that can
represent every single one of us. A good father, a good son, a good friend to have. This happened to him. That
means it could happen to every one of us.""

A Chinese granny shows us that enough is enough: Xie Xiaozhen's courage in fighting off a racist attacker has inspired people the world over,"Tam, L.",Others,2021-03-29,"I have to admit that I love the story of ""David and Goliath"" being played out in real life. Everyone loves a good underdog story, and perhaps now more than ever, we need stories such as these to uplift us.
Fighting racial inequality and combating racial violence has been an unrelenting battle around the world, especially in the US. In recent years, we have witnessed how race-related issues have divided the world. And in some extreme cases – such as the Black Lives Matter movement of 2020 – they have caused nations to implode into social and political upheaval.
There is no doubt that racism exists in every corner of the globe. And unfortunately, Covid-19 has fanned the flames of prejudice against Asian-Americans. This hatred was spurred by then US President Donald Trump, who repeatedly used flippant terms such as ""Chinese virus"" and ""kung flu"" when discussing the coronavirus pandemic.
Even after the end of his presidency, the effects of his anti-Asian rhetoric are being felt in overseas Asian communities.
But every now and then, when we hear stories of victims fighting back or bringing the perpetrators down, we feel a sense of satisfaction, knowing that the culprits are getting their comeuppance.
The latest heroine in the battle against Asian hate crime is a 76-year-old Chinese grandmother Xie Xiaozhen. She is a Chinese immigrant and long-time San Francisco resident.
Last week, Xie defended herself against her assailant, a burly white man in his 30s, with a wooden stick and sent him to hospital on a stretcher. The attack by the man was unprovoked, and he punched Xie in the face while she was out for a walk.
It was no mean feat for a frail and elderly woman to be able to summon such power in the face of life-threatening danger. And in the aftermath of the attack, the scene of Xie sobbing and asking her attacker, ""Why did you hit me?"" in Toisanese – a dialect related to Cantonese – is being played out to millions worldwide.
There is no rational reason that can explain his actions, and there is no point dressing it up. He is a racist, a bigot and a criminal who must be brought to justice.
Chinese diasporas have been a part of world history for hundreds of years, with records showing Chinese merchants settling in Cambodia during the 13th century.
For generations, we have been building new lives, setting up homes, and bringing up children in foreign lands as well as contributing to our communities and new home countries. All of these stories are told with blood, sweat and tears; but thankfully some of these stories come with a happy ending.
This year, we are bearing witness to another wave of mass emigration as many Hong Kong-Chinese residents are flocking to Britain to settle and eventually gain citizenship. But this is another chapter in Chinese history that will undoubtedly be filled with hardship and prejudice.
Some Chinese people there say they have been treated like vermin because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
In Scotland, for example, police said 474 hate crimes against Chinese and Asian and Southeast Asian people were reported between January and December last year, compared to 316 the year before. This is an increase of about 50 per cent.
There are no set rules or strategies to combat or stop racism because of how it manifests itself. Racism isn't always manifested through physical violence, sometimes it rears its ugly head in more covert forms such as systemic racism. But whatever the case, it has no place in our society.
One thing we can do is to control the narrative. No longer should we tolerate those who criticise us for being too ""sensitive"" or tell us that it's not about race. There are those who have been privileged enough not to experience racism first-hand, but this isn't the case for everyone.
In Xie's case, the officers who were called to the scene of her attack claimed that they needed time to determine whether the incident was racially motivated. But through the eyes of victims like Xie, we know the truth.
Victims of race hate crime should never give up their power to speak the truth, fight for the truth, and preserve the truth of their story.
It is encouraging to know that more people are standing up against racial violence, and the silent majority is saying ""enough is enough"". Even the vulnerable like Xie are fighting back, giving us hope that the struggle against racism is picking up momentum.
No doubt Xie's mettle has inspired a lot of people the world over, and not just the global Asian community. She has shown us that true strength is not merely about who has the biggest muscles or the loudest voice; it lies within us and she has shown us that we can summon it when we need it the most.

Four towns decry anti-Asian attacks: Hate crimes have soared in New York,"Chao, M.",Others,2021-03-14,"Amid a recent spate of crimes aimed at Asian Americans, four Bergen County boroughs have passed resolutions
decrying the violence and declaring racism ""a public health crisis.""
Leonia, Fort Lee, Dumont and Harrington Park each adopted the identical statements.
They promised to support measures at the municipal and state level to ""advance efforts to dismantle systemic
racism,"" without discussing specific policies.
The towns called on local, county and state officials to ""denounce racism, xenophobia and intolerance in all
forms and stand with us in solidarity with the Asian and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders communities.""
Hate crimes motivated by anti-Asian sentiment have soared in New York City. There were 27 racially motivated
crimes against people of Asian descent reported last year, compared to one in 2019, according to the NYPD.
Across the country in 2020, there were almost 3,000 reports of anti-Asian discrimination between March 19 and
Dec. 31, according to the Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.The problem has been highlighted by a string of recent assaults, including a January attack that killed 84-year-
old Vicha Ratanapakdee in San Francisco in January. In February, a group of Korean American teens from NorthJersey faced a verbal assault in New York's Times Square. Leonia High School sophomore Yena Choe said a
middle-aged woman glared at the group of face-masked youths and told them, ""Get away from me!"" while waving her hands.
In Wyckoff, meanwhile, a Chinese restaurant was vandalized last June with the words ""coronavirus"" and ""go
home"" spray-painted on the windows and sidewalk.
During his first prime-time address to the nation Thursday, President Joe Biden denounced violent attacks
against Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic as un-American.
Discussing how the pandemic had served to divide and antagonize Americans on a range of issues, Biden called
out ""vicious hate crimes against Asian Americans who've been attacked, harassed, blamed and scapegoated.""
""At this very moment, so many of them, our fellow Americans, are on the front lines of this pandemic trying to
save lives,"" Biden said.
""And still, still they are forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in America. It's wrong, it's
un-American and it must stop.""
In Bergen County, where 17% of people identify as Asian, according to the 2019 Census, the four boroughs
spoke out with resolutions warning not to scapegoat local residents just because the virus originated in China.
The text of the resolutions is as follows:
Condemn and denounce racism, xenophobia and intolerance in all forms.
Call on public officials in other municipalities and at the state level to condemn and denounce racism,
xenophobia and intolerance in all forms and stand with us in solidarity with the Asian and Asian Americans and
Pacific Islanders communities.
Continues to promote and advocate for equality and equity through all policies approved by the mayor and
council.
Recognize the dedication of Asian and Asian-American frontline medical workers, teachers, police and fire
officers and essential workers.
Continue to advocate locally and through the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, New Jersey Conference
of Mayors and all other appropriate associations for relevant policies that improve health in communities of
color.
Support local, state, regional, and federal initiatives that advance efforts to dismantle systemic racism.
Further work to solidify alliances and partnerships with other organizations that are confronting racism and
encourage other local, state, regional and national entities to recognize racism as a public health crisis.
Support community efforts to amplify community efforts to be anti-racist and to combat discrimination and
xenophobia while engaging actively and authentically with communities of color wherever they live.
Promote and support policies and resources that prioritize the health of all people, such as bystander
intervention programs.
Encourage racial equity training among all community partners, vendors and contractors.
Call upon Bergen County Executive Tedesco and the Bergen County Board of Chosen Freeholders to declare
racism as a public health crisis and to enact equity in all policies in the County of Bergen.
Call upon Governor Murphy, State Senate President Sweeney, and State Assembly Speaker Coughlin to also declare racism as a public health crisis and to enact equity in all policies of the state of New Jersey.",4553
Protests Across U.S. Call for End to Anti-Asian Violence; Protests and vigils were held around the country following the deadly shootings at Atlanta-area spas,"McWhirter, C., Pohle, A., & Janin, A. ",Others,2021-03-21,"Protests and vigils calling for an end to violence against Asian-Americans were held around the country over the weekend as lawmakers pushed for better tracking of hate crimes following the deadly shootings at Atlanta-area spas.
Hundreds of people gathered Saturday near the Georgia State Capitol, with some demonstrators carrying signs declaring ""Stop Asian Hate."" Many waved American flags as cars and trucks driving by honked in support.
Xiaoxu Zheng, a 36-year-old medical researcher at Georgia State University, said he came to the protest, his first political event, because he was worried about a rise in anti-Asian prejudice in the past year.
""We live here. We pay taxes. We work here. This is our life,"" said Mr. Zheng, who has been in the U.S. for 10 years and lives in suburban Atlanta with his wife and two children. ""This is a country of immigrants, all of the immigrants, so there is nothing we can do better than love each other, than work together.""
Eight people, including six women of Asian descent, were killed in shootings at three Atlanta-area spas on Tuesday night. Robert Aaron Long, of Woodstock, Ga., was arrested in the attacks and has been charged with eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault, officials said. He is being held in Cherokee County without bond. He waived his right to an attorney, officials said.
The fact that six of the eight victims were women of Asian descent has prompted calls for the suspect to be charged with hate crimes.
Law-enforcement officials in the suburban county where the first shooting occurred have said that Mr. Long told them he was lashing out at his sexual addiction in the attacks. Officials with the Atlanta Police Department said they still were investigating the attacks to determine whether Mr. Long should be charged with hate crimes.
In New York City, hundreds of people gathered in Manhattan's Union Square on Sunday for a solidarity march to the borough's Chinatown neighborhood.
Shuangye Zhu, a 28-year-old preschool teacher in Queens, held a sign saying ""Hate is Virus"" as the names of the Atlanta shooting victims were read aloud at the demonstration. She said the attacks have left some of her co-workers scared to take public transportation.
""We're here because we feel so bad about it,"" Ms. Zhu said of attending the march.
On Saturday, hundreds of protesters gathered in Times Square to march to Manhattan's Chinatown.
Wayne Huang, 42, who was born in New York City and lives in Chinatown, brought his two boys to the demonstration. He said his children were attending their first march.
""It's hard to explain the hate to them, and the evil, but they have to have that awareness that it is time to support the community,"" Mr. Huang said.
Police and government officials in New York City and other U.S. cities have said hate crimes against Asian Americans have risen since the Covid-19 pandemic, which was first identified in China.

Christopher Wray, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, told NPR last week that while the spa shootings are still under investigation, ""it does not appear that the motive was racially motivated.""
Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D., Ill.) said Sunday she has urged the heads of the Justice Department and the FBI to look into whether hate crimes against Asian-Americans have been underreported.
""I want to see a deeper investigation into whether or not these shootings and other similar crimes are racially motivated,"" Ms. Duckworth said on CBS News's ""Face the Nation.""
Rep. Judy Chu (D., Calif.), who heads the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, said Sunday that she is pushing for legislation to improve the reporting of hate crimes. She said on ABC News's ""This Week"" that 18 states don't track hate crimes and three states don't have a hate-crime statute in the law.
""Our reporting is very flawed, because it relies on local law enforcement agencies to voluntarily provide such statistics,"" Ms. Chu said.
President Biden on Friday met with Asian-American leaders in Atlanta and urged Congress to pass the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act. The legislation would expedite Justice Department reviews of race-related crimes linked to Covid-19. Mr. Biden also called on the Senate to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.
Heidi Ng, a 28-year-old college budget officer, was one of hundreds of people who gathered in San Francisco's Chinatown on Saturday.
Ms. Ng, who was holding a sign saying ""Love us like u love our food,"" said she was fed up by the recent attacks.
""They remind me that the next person could possibly be one of my family members; it could be my mom,"" she said.
Kate Dang, 27, of Atlanta, said she came to the rally near the Georgia State Capitol on Saturday because the spa shootings were an extreme example of a general disregard people have shown toward Asian-American women.
""Misogyny and racism tend to go hand in hand,"" she said.
Ms. Dang attended the rally with her friend, Fei Li, 33, also of Atlanta. Both said that in the past year anti-Asian attitudes in the U.S. have grown worse, fueled by societal worries about the Covid-19 pandemic and remarks by former President Donald Trump, who they said exacerbated anti-Asian prejudice by blaming China for the spread of virus and referring to the virus as ""kung flu."" Civil-rights groups have said the term was a racial slur.
""He wasn't the sole factor, but he was a huge factor,"" Ms. Li said of Mr. Trump.
Spokespeople for Mr. Trump didn't respond to a request for comment. Former White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany previously has said Mr. Trump wasn't being offensive when he referred to the virus as ""kung flu"" but was ""linking it to its place of origin.""
Ms. Li hoped the rally would raise awareness among political leaders and the general public that Asian-Americans, especially Asian-American women, deserved to feel safe. She said she hoped that in the future it wouldn't take tragedies like the shootings to bring these issues to people's attention.
At the march in Times Square on Saturday, Lauren Shin, 24, made signs on cardboard that said ""Say Their Names"" and listed the names of the Atlanta shooting victims.
Ms. Shin, a New York City resident, said she has been aware of violence against Asian Americans, but the attacks in Atlanta hit home. She said she realized that she took her safety for granted, and that being a Korean-American woman could put her in danger.
""I'm trying to channel my fear and anger into something actionable,"" she said of attending the march.

On the streets you feel a lot of anxiety ,Sydney Morning Herald,Others,2021-03-25,"Washington: As the representative for New York's 40th state assembly district, Ron Kim has seen the rise of anti-Asian harassment and violence up close since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Kim's district includes Flushing, a bustling neighbourhood in Queens that is renowned as the home of New York's most authentic Chinese food. More than six in 10 of his constituents are of Asian heritage, mostly Chinese and Korean.
""Asian Americans have been shoved and attacked in the downtown area of my district,"" says Kim, the only Korean American ever elected to New York's state legislature.
""Walking around the streets or on the subway you feel a lot of tension and anxiety.""
When Americans began feeling concerned about the coronavirus in February 2019, New York mayor Bill de Blasio headed to a Chinese restaurant in Flushing to show his support for the Asian-American community.
Restaurants in the area were already reporting a drop-off in customers because of misguided fears that people could catch the virus from Chinese cooking.
De Blasio would later be ridiculed for encouraging people to gather in restaurants just as the virus was beginning to spread throughout the country. But he was right to be worried about growing discrimination against Asian Americans. Former president Donald Trump did not help by calling COVID-19 the ""China virus"" and the ""kung flu"".
The Stop Asian and Pacific Islander Hate group released a report last week showing it had recorded 3800 anti-Asian hate incidents over the past year. The vast majority were verbal harassment and shunning, but there were also hundreds of reports of physical violence.
The biggest spike occurred in New York City, which prides itself on being a progressive, multicultural melting pot. The attacks have continued even as coronavirus cases and hospitalisations plummeted in recent months.
In February there were four attacks against Asian-American women in New York on a single day. Two women were attacked on subways; one was pepper-sprayed while walking down the street; another was shoved to the ground.
The owner of Xian Famous Foods, a popular chain serving noodles and dumplings, revealed he had started closing earlier so his staff members could get home safely. Two of Jason Wang's employees were punched in the face in unprovoked attacks - something he said had never occurred before the pandemic.
""We have even young Asian Americans who refuse to leave their apartments in fear that they might be a target of a hate crime, that they might be spat on,"" Kim says. ""There's a lot of trauma and stress, and it's not just older Asian Americans who feel it.""
Yet until recently, the rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans had received relatively little attention. The issue was eclipsed last year by the Black Lives Matter protests following George Floyd's death in Minneapolis.
That changed last week when a white man shot dead six Asian women working in massage parlours in Atlanta, Georgia. The shootings helped drive protesters across the country. Grey's Anatomy actress Sandra Oh attended a rally in Philadelphia where she urged Asian-American protesters to chant: ""I am proud to be Asian! I belong here!""
Kim says the shootings in Atlanta are an imperfect example of the broader phenomenon of anti-Asian attacks. The shooter, a white evangelical Christian, has denied that race was a motivating factor in the attacks, telling police he was driven to kill by a sense of shame about his addiction to sex.
Kim adds that anti-Asian attacks in his district have often been carried out by members of other minority communities, complicating the racial dynamics of the issue.
""We're seeing a lot of young black and brown teenagers attacking older Asian adults,"" he says.
""We have a lot of work to do to let people in these communities know that Asian Americans are not the ones that caused their grief and their economic distress.""
As much as he disliked Trump's inflammatory ""China virus"" rhetoric, the Democrat says it's too easy to heap all the blame on the former president.
""We can't just put on a Band-Aid, blame Trump and call it a day,"" Kim says. ""That's not good enough.""

Raising Asian Jewish Kids in the U.S. Has Never Been More Scary,"Muhlrad, M.",Others,2021-03-25,"LAST WEEK, eight people were killed - including six women of Asian descent - at three massage parlors in the Atlanta area. This horrifying shooting came at a time of alarming xenophobia and bigotry against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States amid the COVTD-19 pandemic.
Since the start of the pandemic, anti-Asian hate crimes have increased by 1,900% in the United States, with women reporting 2.3 times more hate incidents than men. Experts have blamed this troubling uptick in Asian hate crimes, in part, on Donald Trumpâeuro™s dangerous rhetoric, with the former president using damaging terms such as âeuroœChina virusâeuro and âeuroœkung fluâeuro to refer to COVTD-19. The details surrounding this tragedy are continuing to develop, as more information regarding the victims and gunman are being released. Despite the fact that the majority of the victims were Asian women, the motivation behind the gunmanâeuro™s massacre is still to be determined.
I am an Asian American Jewish woman living in Los Angeles. My parents immigrated from Taiwan in the 1970s, and my twin sister and I were born in Los Angeles in the 1980s. I converted to Judaism three years ago, before my second child was born, a decision that was many years in the making. My husband and I are currently raising our two Asian American Jewish preschool-aged children in Los Angeles.
News reports surrounding the violence in Atlanta have been very careful in how they describe the shootings and the gunmanâeuro™s motivations. The media has carefully parsed details of the victims, emphasizing that six of the eight victims were Asian (two were white) and seven of the victims were women (one was male). It is as if the fact that not all the victims were Asian, and not all were female - even though the overwhelming majority were Asian females - should make the situation any less alarming. Even if this tragedy does not end up being classified as a hate crime, it is undoubtedly a hate-filled, violent attack aimed squarely at Asian women. The mediaâeuro™s couched and carefully chosen statements do a disservice to how horrific the crime is that was committed.
When I first heard of the shootings, I had just finished putting my two energetic young children to bed. As parents of young children know, my day had been jam-packed with preschool dropoff and pickup, meals, bath, bedtime and so on, all amid the backdrop of the pandemic. The momenta of quiet after my kids fall asleep each day are precious to me - a reprieve from the chaos that riddles my days.
I finally sat down to rest when I noticed I had missed a text message from my husband, who was still finishing up his work. He had sent me a Twitter link accompanied by the comment, âeuroœSo scary, 8 Asian women murdered in ATL.âeuro I stopped in my tracks. In complete disbelief, I had to read his description twice. I quickly forwarded the link to my sister, who had not heard the news yet, and she wrote back sharing my shock and horror.
As a mother of half-Asian Jewish children, the tragedy in Atlanta led me to fear for the safety of my children. It's the kind of fear that you not only comprehend in your head, but one that you physically feel course through your veins. My children will grow up in a society where some people may hate them because of the color of their skin and others may hate them for the faith that they believe in (and, of course, there are plenty who would hate them for both reasons). As a mother, I was left with two big questions. How do I keep my children safe from the hate that Asians and Jewish people experience on a daily basis in the United States? And how do I best educate my children on a society where people are hated or victimized for their race and/or their religion?
I'm embarrassed to admit this, but my first reaction when thinking about how to best protect my children from the Asian and Jewish hate that they may experience was to flee. After my initial shock over the Atlanta shootings, I found myself dramatically proclaiming to my husband that I didn't think that the United States was a safe place for our family anymore. Sure, it was an extreme reaction to what had happened, but perhaps it was the ""fight or flight"" reaction to fear that led me to choose ""flight.""
In the past, my husband and I have talked about moving to a different country - particularly to China or Taiwan, given that I still have many extended family members there. It's an idea we've addressed with more seriousness in the last year as COVID-19 has created more remote work environments. Now that anti-Semitism has hit an all-time high and Asian hate crimes are increasing in the United States, perhaps it is time to make this move?
And yet, upon further reflection, I recognized that fleeing the country is not the answer. In this dark time, I am reminded of the Jewish principle of tikkun olam, or repairing the world - the idea being that although the world is a good place, God left us room to make improvements. I realized that the way to keep my children safe is to do my best to make the world a safer place for them. I'm still figuring out what this means for me, and I know that this will be a lifelong process. But some ideas I have are continuing to give tzedakah to charities that are doing important work to fight anti-Semitism and Asian hate, bringing awareness to these important issues, and continuing to stand up against hateful rhetoric.
For my children, I know it will be important to educate them on their dual Asian and Jewish identities in order to allow them to fully embrace the multi-faceted identities that they hold. Our family has discussed the importance of visiting China and Israel (when it is safe to travel again) in order to help teach them about the history of both of their cultures, as well as to meet others that are both similar and different from them. My husband and I hope to raise them to be open-minded and to love who they are - and to also appreciate the differences of others. I only hope that this continual lifelong education will help them stand against the Asian and Jewish hate that they may encounter in their lifetimes.
When reflecting on raising children amid this tragedy and rising hate crimes, I also found myself thinking about the names that my husband and I had chosen for my children, and the hopes that we had for them when they were born. Our 4-year-old daughter, Ruth, is named after her great-grandmother, Ruth. In the bible, Ruth was a widow who loyally remained with her husband's mother, even after her husband's death, choosing to accept a life of poverty among people she admired. Ruth - who is famous for being the first woman in the bible to convert to Judaism - the utters the famous words, ""Where you go I will go; where you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God"" (Ruth 1:16). Ruth is an example of loyalty and devotion, and true friendship.
Our 2-year-old son, Micah, was named after his greatgrandfather, Martin. In the bible, Micah fearlessly denounced the evils that had filled his beloved land. As a prophet, he elaborates on what God expects from Israel: ""He has told thee, man, what is good, and what God requires of thee: only to do justly, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with thy God."" Micah is an example of humility, kindness, and standing up against evil.
These are all qualities that we aim to impart on our children. My hope is that my husband and I can teach our children to be loyal to each part of their mixed identities, to be kind and humble towards others, to enjoy friendship with those that are different from them, and to have courage to stand up against any evil that they will encounter. *

Anti-Asian violence is a public safety crisis for all,"Torres, S.",Others,2021-03-24,"On my walks through pre-pandemic Shanghai in late September 2019, around every corner I stumbled upon everyday scenes of older people's integration into the fabric of the city and community life.
People with full heads of gray hair rode bikes and sat in front of storefronts, chatting with neighbors and eating meals from large metal bowls. An old woman whizzed by in a motorized wheelchair alongside scooters in the street. At Fuxing Park, grandpas tended to grandchildren and older men bounced spinning disks in a game of diabolo.
After three days of walking around Shanghai's teeming streets, I rested my weary feet at Jing'an Sculpture Park. An old man glanced at me writing in my notebook and struck up a conversation in English. He'd studied English in the United States and wanted to know how old I thought he was. 70, I guessed. He threw his head back and smiled. 85. He lived nearby and came to the park every day.
Such postcards echo similar scenes in Asian neighborhoods across the United States. They remind me of older men smoking, chatting and sipping warm beverages in a plaza near San Francisco's Japantown and a trio of elders gathered for morning calisthenics in North Beach's Washington Square. They spark sweet memories of the elders I saw before the pandemic who danced at Portsmouth Square in Chinatown, reminding me that I've not danced with my hula class in a year. Many Asian American and Pacific Islander elders in my halau modeled aging with joy, smiling as they danced through aches and pains and weathered the loss of relatives and friends.
Public outings carry extra danger for Asian people, with a spate of recent attacks targeted against Asian elders that have resulted in racial trauma, injury, and death. In the Bay Area, viral videos showed the senseless killing of an 84-year-old Thai man named Vicha Ratanapakdee, thrown violently to the ground in San Francisco. Days later, another video surfaced of a 91-year-old man also shoved in Oakland's Chinatown. Other violence against Asian elders has involved robbery, such as the ambush of a 67-year-old man in San Francisco laundromat and 75-year-old Pak Ho robbed and killed in Oakland during his morning walk last week.
Volunteer escorts have sprung up to assist Asian elders, along with other DIY community safety efforts such as hiring private armed security guards and providing shopkeepers with air horns. But they aren't a cure-all, and public safety depends on sustained government support and commitment.
These attacks haven't occurred in a vacuum but have intersected with rising violence and economic insecurity. Desolate cities and empty retail spaces from businesses that haven't survived the COVID pandemic mean fewer ""eyes on the street,"" increasing danger for everyone, but especially Asian elders who may be perceived as vulnerable. Decades of structural racism and community disinvestment have exacerbated the pandemic's acute economic devastation and increasing gun violence across the country.
Russell Jeung, San Francisco State University Professor and co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, has pointed to community disinvestment in areas with Asian residents, ""We live in multiracial neighborhoods with high crime rates and in these neighborhoods everybody is attacked, everybody is vulnerable...on a day to day basis in these high crime neighborhoods, pretty much every racial group is a target. We need more opportunities and more resources in these under-resourced communities like mine.""
Re-imagining community safety doesn't mean flooding streets with police officers. It does mean investing in jobs, educational opportunities, health care and affordable housing that make healthy communities, and programs to promote public safety such as non-police community ambassador programs and violence reduction efforts targeted towards young people.
In Oakland, pandemic closures of schools and community spaces have hampered community violence prevention programs. Recently, for the first time in a year I saw teenagers doing football drills on a gleaming new field at Fremont High School, benefiting the school's mostly Black and brown student body. I felt safer witnessing this small but important step forward.
""Even if you're not directly impacted, having bullets flying by your house is traumatic,"" says Loren Taylor, a city council member representing East Oakland. Last month I experienced this trauma during a quiet Sunday afternoon interrupted by the firecracker sound of spraying bullets across the street from my Oakland home. No one was harmed, but as I watched police officers place at least 10 yellow evidence markers near bullet casings, I worried about the Chinese grandmother who often sits with her grandson on the porch of their intergenerational home two doors down. Fortunately, she was safe.
Racism and violence are twin public health crises that require a response as urgent as our investment in COVID vaccine development. Living in a fortress is not a solution, nor should we expect anyone to restrict their activities and movement due to fear and racism. In this tense time we mustn't lose sight of public acts of interracial solidarity, such as rallies against anti-Asian violence. We have a collective interest in safe public spaces and communities free from racial harm.
When vandals destroyed treasured cherry blossom trees outside San Francisco's Japanese Cultural Center in January, I reflected on how much we have already lost to hate. The community raised funds for replacements, but unless we root out the seeds of hate, we will be replanting trees and mourning lives needlessly lost for generations to come.

Mayor denounces hate hurled at owner,"Barkas, S.",Others,2021-03-28,"Palm Desert's mayor and council members denounced the ""hateful acts"" of a group of women who used profanities and mocked the Korean accent of a longtime resident and restaurant owner this week when she asked them to leave at closing time.
""Behavior such as this does not represent the values of Palm Desert,"" Mayor Kathleen Kelly said during Thursday's City Council meeting.
The incident occurred Monday night at Musashi Japanese Restaurant and Sushi Bar on Highway 111 in Palm Desert, where owner Stella Kim said she had a run-in with three customers, all women, who came in for dinner early in the evening.
The women dined inside and remained at the table talking long after their meal had been served, Kim told The Desert Sun on Friday. The restaurant closes at 9:30 p.m. and by 9 p.m., the three women were the only customers remaining, Kim said.
When staff began preparing to close — putting up the chairs, sweeping the floor and cleaning — the women continued to chat among themselves, she said.
When Kim heard them call Uber for a ride, ""I said, 'Ladies, can you wait for Uber outside, please?'"" Kim said.
They got up to leave without saying anything, and Kim said she thanked them.
Then, one of the women came back in to use the restroom and began complaining to Kim about the food saying it was horrible, they had to wait too long and would not be back.
""I told her, 'That's fine,'"" Kim said.
The woman continued to complain and argue, cursed at Kim and began mocking her Korean accent, Kim said.
""I have never had this experience in Palm Desert,"" said Kim, who moved to the Coachella Valley in 1993, opening her restaurant — one of two — in 1996.
""I have such good customers and I never felt they looked down on me,"" Kim said.
She and her husband raised their children in Palm Desert, and said none of them have experienced racism in the valley.
""I'm very happy to have raised my children in this valley,"" she said.
Racial attacks — verbal and physical — on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have been on the rise, largely fueled by people who say they blame people of Asian descent for the COVID-19 pandemic.
There have been reports of Asian people being recently attacked in the Los Angeles area and on March 16 eight people, including six Asian women, were killed when a gunman opened fire in three spas during a spree that spanned the Atlanta area. Authorities continue to investigate the suspect's motives.
The Indio City Council may soon consider a resolution condemning racism and violence against Asian Americans in the east valley city, as a result of the Georgia shootings.
Kim said the three women, all white, had never before been in Musashi.
Mayor: 'We abhor all hateful acts'
When Kelly heard of the incident, she issued a written statement Thursday which she later read during the City Council meeting.
""We abhor all hateful acts. A hateful act toward any of us diminishes us all. Diversity with its varied experiences, perspectives and languages is a vital asset of this community,"" Kelly said.
The city in 2020 adopted ""Unite Palm Desert"" as its mantra and guiding principal, Kelly said.
""Over the last 12 months, much of our focus under the 'Unite Palm Desert' banner has been about holding up those most affected by the pandemic with essential support,"" Kelly said.
""But 'Unite Palm Desert' is about much more than that. It encourages our whole community to embrace the principles of mutual respect expressed in city of Palm Desert Resolution No. 2018-09, in which we affirmed that this city will not tolerate prejudice, racism, bigotry, hatred, bullying and violence towards any groups within our community.""
National Public Health Week is commemorated April 4-10, which Kelly said makes it timely to affirm that much more than physical well-being contributes to public health.
She and the City Council on Thursday presented a proclamation ""imploring us all to recommit ourselves to achieving a fully healthy community in which people of all ethnicities, identities and backgrounds consistently enjoy equal respect.""
Other council members also commented on the incident involving Kim.
""This personally, as an English learner, is something that spoke to me, as somebody who has been told, 'Learn English. Speak English. Go back to your country.' These are things that I have heard, that my family has heard,"" Councilmember Karina Quintanilla said.
When someone speaks to her with an accent, Quintanilla said, ""I hear hope, I hear hard work, I hear determination, and that's what an accent means to me.""
Mayor Pro Tem Jan Harnik said she has known Kim and her family for a long time.
""Their children graduated from Palm Desert High, they've been great supporters of the high school; they've been great community members and it's a great family and they're wonderful people,"" Harnik said. ""I know Stella well and ... it's hard for me to even understand how anybody could say that to the caliber of human being that Stella is.""
Councilmember Sabby Jonathan said he is an immigrant who has been ""the recipient of hate throughout my life. But you know, I always felt that those who hate and do these bad things to other people do not represent our city, the Coachella Valley or our country.""
Kim said she appreciates the city's support.
""I don't want to make a big deal about this ... but this is upsetting,"" she said.

Racial Divide: The Developing stigma of Black vs Asian,"Speid, A.",Others,2021-03-25,"Given the recent attacks that have occurred against the Asian American Community, including the mass shooting of several Asian descendants in Atlanta, one cannot help but notice an underlying narrative that has invoked divide with two marginalized groups to create a situation that works in favor of white supremacy.
One elderly woman was burned alive in Brooklyn, New York after being attacked without warning. In January of this year, an 84-year-old was knocked down and killed by assailants who were depicted as young Black men. What this does is create the perfect storm of Asian/African American divide and giving law enforcement the excuse to not be able to do anything about it, and to also continue to paint the narrative of black disparity.
Since the anti-racism protest in 2020, more and more attacks against other races have surged across the country, including attacks in Chinatown and many Asian-American communities. As reported by the Stop AAPI Hate coalition (Asian American and Pacific Islanders), there has been an uptick in Anti-Asian discrimination and attacks. One could point towards the rise of COVID-19 and the narrative of the virus' origin from China. This leads to ignorance and therefore thoughtless attacks against all Asian-Americans-some who have never even been to China, nor are from China at all.
In the IPSOS polls in the Center for Public Integrity back in 2020, 56% of Americans believed COVID was a natural disaster, while the 44/45% blame China, and 9% in that 44% blame the Chinese Government.
Today, those numbers have altered to 57% believing COVID is a natural disaster, while 43% point towards specific people and organizations. Among those specifics, 54% believe China (including labs, scientist, and the government) are responsible.
Obviously, the virus and former President Donald Trump stirring the pot have created much of the incentive for these attacks, but such anti-Asian sentiments have existed since the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and the 1942 Japanese American internment camps issued by President Franklin Roosevelt.
However, what does all this have to do with the African American Community?

Hundreds gather in Honolulu to speak out against Asian American discrimination,"Ladao, M. ",Others,2021-03-28,"Related Photo Gallery: 
Hundreds rallied at the state Capitol and marched through Chinatown on Saturday in a show of unity against targeted attacks on Asian Americans in the U.S., most recently highlighted when a man shot and killed eight people, six of whom were women of Asian descent, at three spas in the Atlanta area earlier this month. 
The Honolulu event coincided with other “Stop Asian Hate” rallies and protests held around the country in response to the apparent spike in discrimination and violence toward Asian Americans since the onset of COVID-19, which is believed to have originated at a wet market in Wuhan, China. 
By the 10 a.m. start of the local rally, about 200 people had already gathered at the Capitol with signs condemning discrimination against Asian Americans and, specifically, Asian American women. 
“I am not a virus, a fetish, a model minority — I am human,” one sign read, while another said, “Solidarity with Asian communities — fight racism!” 
More than a dozen speakers, from elected officials to students to teachers, addressed the crowd. 
State Rep. Jeanne Kapela (D, Naalehu-Captain Cook-Keauhou) referred to the March 16 shooting in the Atlanta area “as another outbreak of the ongoing epidemic of mass gun violence here in our country, and it was also an act of racial terror against Asians and Asian Americans.” 
The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, found that hate crimes against Asian Americans grew 6% in 2020 despite a 145% drop in overall hate crimes. The Anti- Defamation League found that Asian Americans have experienced the greatest jump in online harassment this year compared to last. 
And Asian American women were found to have reported 2.3 times more “hate incidents” than men during the pandemic, according to Stop AAPI Hate, a reporting center launched by the Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council, Chinese for Affirmative Action, and the Asian American Studies Department of San Francisco State University. 
That is likely linked to stereotypes placed on Asian American and Pacific Islander women, Kapela said. 
“I’ve often seen violence against women linked directly to a man’s sexual aggression,” she told the crowd. “Women, especially women of Asian and Pacific Islander ancestry, are exoticized as objects of male fantasies and valued for nothing more than their sex appeal.” 
Though the most blatant racist acts have taken place on the mainland, for some in Hawaii it’s still all too easy to empathize with what’s been happening out of state. 
Jamie Goya, the lead massage therapist at a luxury spa in Waikiki and one of the organizers of Saturday’s rally, said she could have easily been targeted in an attack like the one in Atlanta. 
“I realized that no matter how prestigious the place I work at, it wouldn’t matter, because I look the way I do,” Goya, a Japanese American, told the Honolulu Star- Advertiser. “That could have been me — that is me. I would still be targeted by people who have that racism within them.” 
The California native said she was called to action after news reports of an 84-year-old man, native to Thailand, who was attacked in San Francisco and later died from his injuries. 
Speaking to the crowd, Jen Kanoelani Noborikawa, who lives in New York City but grew up in Hawaii and is visiting family, said she’ll be “afraid for her life” when she heads back. 
“I know some people think this is kind of a personal, irrational fear. I definitely know it’s not,” she said, also citing a recent attack on an Asian American senior. “In the neighborhood next to me where I live, last year an 89-year-old Asian woman was lit on fire.” 
Cindy Jurgens, who lives in Kaimuki, attended the rally with her husband. Jurgens, who is Chinese, Vietnamese and Japanese, said one of her biggest concerns is that discrimination against Asians will end up being a short-term issue in a year that’s been full of problems. 
“I’m concerned that this is just going to be a rally and a social media hashtag,” she said. “But it’s been a year full of stacked stresses,” noting the impacts of the coronavirus and the growth of other social justice causes, in particular the Black Lives Matter movement that sparked even larger global protests last year. 
“And now that we’re getting vaccinated, mass shootings are happening again,” she said, referring to the Boulder, Colo., mass shooting that killed 10 people just a week after the Atlanta shooting. “I feel like people are really tired.” 
Christina Moon, a Zen teacher at Daihonzan Chozen-ji, a Rinzai Zen temple in Kalihi, urged the crowd to use the momentum to make change. 
“It’s really important to figure out what to do with this moment. … Some of you guys might not like to hear this, but this is a fight for freedom. Freedom struggles are long,” she said. 
Goya said her goal is to create an online repository of resources to help Asian American and Pacific Islander communities learn “how to protect ourselves.” She noted one resource, a movement called “Hollaback!,” that offers training “to respond to, intervene in, and heal from harassment.”

"Incident in Portland adds to growing fears of anti-Asian racism The possible hate crime isn't surprising in a year of heightened xenophobia, the community says.","Graham, G.",Others,2021-03-18,"Marpheen Chann was both surprised and unsurprised to learn that an Asian American woman in Portland was the victim of an attack police say was racially motivated.
Surprised because it happened just down the road from his home in Portland, a city he sees as a welcoming place that has led Maine on issues like LGBTQ rights. And yet not surprised because of increasingly racist rhetoric against Asian Americans locally and across the country since the beginning of the pandemic.
""There's a lot of fear, uncertainty, sadness that this is happening when times are already especially tough. We've dealt with a year of anti-Asian racism and xenophobia because of the virus,"" Chann said. ""We've been going about our days differently, whether it's grocery shopping or going around town or driving or waiting in a parking lot. There's always that fear that something might happen.""
Portland police say an agitated white man may have committed a hate crime on Monday when he yelled ""go back to where you came from"" at an Asian American woman before kicking a side mirror off her car. The woman, who was with her young children when she was accosted outside of an oil change business on Forest Avenue, recorded the incident and reported it to police.
Police identified Troy Sprague, 47, as the suspect. Sprague, who police say is homeless, is facing a charge of criminal mischief as police continue to investigate the incident as a possible hate crime.
Sprague was not arrested or issued a summons because he was acting ""manic"" and not wearing a mask and ran away from police, said David Singer, a spokesman for the department. Officers will monitor Sprague and issue the summons the next time they come in contact with him, he said.
'This is nothing new to us'
Members of Asian American communities in Portland say the incident has caused widespread fear, with some people afraid to go to the grocery store or to let their children travel to and from school. Since the Portland incident was reported, the leadership of United Asian Communities, a group formed during the pandemic to unite and support those communities in Maine, has been taking calls from people who talk about only going to the store in groups.
Asian Americans have experienced harassment and micro-aggressions for years, ranging from laws that prohibited immigrants from China in the 1880s to internment of Japanese Americans during World War II to people telling Asian Americans to ""go home."" Asian Americans are the third most targeted ethnic or racial group after African Americans and Jewish Americans, said Amy Chea, the secretary and chief strategy officer for UAC.
""This is nothing new to us,"" said Chan Himm, president and CEO of United Asian Communities. ""Your heart is broken and it's hurt because of what just happened in our community. To continuously try to calm them and let them know they are safe and secure, that's a hard conversation to have.""
Portland's mayor and city councilors issued written statements denouncing the incident on Monday, labeling it as a hate crime. All said the city of Portland is a welcoming community that does not tolerate hate.
""We will continue to work to make Portland a city that welcomes everyone and creates a secured community with a sense of belonging and inclusiveness for all and we stand united against hate,"" Mayor Kate Snyder said.
Councilor Tae Chong, who is Asian American, cited the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes around the country and said it was unsettling that it happened to a family in Portland.
""Our community is only as good as how safe everyone feels,"" Chong said. ""Hate has no place in our community, where we all call Portland home.""
Such incidents that involve violence are relatively rare in Maine, but similar reports of violence and harassment targeting Asian Americans have surged nationally during the pandemic, fueled by rhetoric blaming the coronavirus on China or Asian Americans. While in office, former President Donald Trump repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as the ""kung flu"" and ""China virus.""
spike in anti-asian hate crimes
The Stop AAPI Hate reporting center has recorded 3,795 incidents targeting Asian American and Pacific Islanders between March 19, 2020, and Feb. 28. Most of the incidents have been aimed at women, and range from verbal harassment to physical assaults. A recent report by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism said anti-Asian hate crimes increased 149 percent in American's largest cities last year.
On Tuesday, eight people - six of whom were Asian - were shot to death at three Atlanta-area massage parlors, raising further alarm about hate crimes against people of Asian descent. Police in major cities had already ramped up security in some neighborhoods following violent attacks on Asian Americans in the past year.
Police in Portland have not been receiving more reports of crimes against Asian Americans. In the past year, Asian Americans were victims of three assaults or other violent crimes in the city, but it is not known if race was a factor in those cases, Singer said.
""To be the target of such a racist and hate-induced crime cuts directly against everything we stand for in the city of Portland,"" police Chief Frank Clark said on Tuesday of the attack on Forest Avenue.
An estimated 1.3 percent of Maine's 1.3 million residents, or roughly 17,000 people, are of Asian descent, according to the U.S. Census. That does not include people who identify with two or more races.
FBI data published by the Anti-Defamation League shows 19 reports of hate crimes in Maine in 2019, one fewer than 2018. Of the 19 incidents in 2019, 10 involved race, although races are not broken down. Seven incidents involved sexual orientation and two involved religion.
FBI hate crime data is not available for 2020, but the ADL lists 19 incidents last year in Maine that did not rise to the level of a crime, up from 16 in 2019. The vast majority of those were related to white-supremacist propaganda.
fears of being ignored
Chann, president of the Cambodian Community Association of Maine and an educator at the Holocaust and Human Rights Center of Maine, said he has heard of other racist actions against Asian Americans in southern Maine, including graffiti painted on the walls of an Asian market and comments made to a local woman while she was leading a church service. He believes some people are hesitant to report harassment or other crimes to police because Asian Americans have not felt heard or that their concerns are addressed.
""I think that's part of the trepidation that many people in the Asian American community feel when something happens. Will police listen? Will officials do anything about this? For a large part of our history in America, the answer has been no,"" he said. ""That's the reason many Asian Americans feel like they can't speak up, because they're just going to be ignored.""
Thuy Sullivan, a UAC board member, said she and others in the Vietnamese community have felt uncomfortable and felt real fear, especially since the beginning of the pandemic. As national leaders used language like ""China virus"" during the pandemic, they noticed people moving away from them in stores, even though they were not more likely to have the virus.
""Many of us in the Asian communities in Portland have had experiences that make them feel very uncomfortable,"" she said.
Many Asian Americans across the United States hesitate to report that type of biased behavior because they have been brought up in a culture where they were taught not to speak up, said Chea, the UAC's secretary and chief strategy officer.
""These are people who have survived the worst of humanity, war and genocide, and now they're forced to be afraid of radicalized domestic terrorists,"" she said. ""Many Asian immigrants are from authoritarian countries were speaking out against injustice means you are targeted, jailed and murdered.""
'needs to be brought to light'
Theresa Kim, director of legal resources for UAC, is frustrated and discouraged that police did not immediately issue a summons to Sprague in connection with the incident on Forest Avenue. She worries that it will discourage people from speaking up and about what could happen if a future incident escalates to more violence.
""It's a topic that needs to be brought to light and that needs to be talked about,"" Kim said. ""It needs to stop being swept under the rug.""
The leadership of United Asian Communities say they are trying to channel the grief, fear and sadness members of their community are feeling into action to combat bias and racism against Asian Americans. By coming together to standup for their communities, they are trying to combat stigmas and empower people to speak out without fear of local or immigration authorities, said Thomas Ling, who serves as vice president of the organization.
""I think right now, in this point in our history, it's more important than ever that the Asian American community is vocal and stands up and unifies and empowers each other,"" he said.

violence rattles a community: Asian Americans are feeling under attack and largely alone,"Liu, M., & HATZIPANAGOS, R.",Others,2021-03-07,"They gather almost every night at San Francisco’s Dragon Gate, the ornately decorated entrance to the
nation’s oldest Chinatown. Armed with only whistles and pamphlets, the volunteer neighborhood patrol roams
the streets, checking out ATMs and mom-andpop shops in areas where Asian residents have experienced attacks
that have left this neighborhood on edge.
Some volunteers drive more than an hour to walk these blocks — largely deserted by a combination of fear and
pandemic lockdown — to hand out bilingual fliers that explain how to report a crime to police. Similar patrols
have sprouted in Asian neighborhoods in Oakland, Calif., Los Angeles and New York City, a response to what
these communities say is a wave of racist violence and harassment since headlines about a virus from China
began appearing in U.S. media a year ago.
Data is scant, but at least two U.S. cities logged an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans in 2020.
The New York Police Department reported at least 28 hate crimes that targeted Asian American victims last year,
compared with three the previous year. San Francisco’s preliminary data shows that nine hate crimes targeted
Asian Americans in 2020, up from six the year before and four in 2018.
Several viral videos of attacks on Asian pedestrians in February have heightened concerns: a Filipino man
slashed with a box cutter on a New York City train; a 52-year-old woman shoved to the ground in Flushing,
Queens; a woman punched in the face on a New York subway platform; and a Los Angeles man beaten with his
own cane at a bus stop.
It’s unclear whether the violence in each of those viral videos was racially motivated, but the incidents have left
Asian Americans feeling not only under attack but also largely alone in addressing neighborhood crime, with
many of the assailants remaining elusive. While some residents have joined neighborhood patrols, others are
arming themselves for protection. And still others have pushed for law enforcement to create task forces and
liaisons to better address neighborhood concerns.
“People are fed up about not being heard, not being seen and waiting for help,” said Will Lex Ham, an activist
who has participated in the San Francisco Chinatown street patrols and organized rallies in New York. “We’re not
getting the allyship we need, the resources we need. We have to pick ourselves up by the bootstraps.”
Public attention to attacks on Asian Americans soared after 84-year-old Vicha Ratanapakdee was assaulted in
San Francisco in January. According to his son-in-law Eric Lawson, he was on his daily neighborhood walk and
recovering from multiple heart surgeries when he was shoved so violently that he later died.
“Thai grandpa,” as he was known by community activists, became a rallying cry for celebrities and other Asian
Americans who added his face to their social media profile pictures. His daughter Amy Ratanapakdee believes it
was a hate crime.
“It’s like a senseless act of violence and could happen to any one of us,” she said, adding that her own children
have been called racial epithets on the street during the past year. “I want everyone to know how my father
died and hope that in his memory, people will join me to hope that justice presides.”
A 19-year-old man has pleaded not guilty to murder in Ratanapakdee’s attack. And a suspect has been arrested
in the case of Noel Quintana, the 61-year-old Filipino man whose face was slashed on a New York City subway
train as he traveled to work earlier in February.
“Nobody came, nobody helped, nobody made a video,” he said.
Quintana reported the crime to police, and the suspect has been charged with assault. But many cases never
get that far.
Victims from marginalized communities can be reluctant to engage with police because of cultural differences,
language barriers or distrust. Even when they do report, proving that they were targeted because of their race is
difficult.
To fill in the data gap, some Asian American organizations are tracking these incidents on their own. Stop AAPI
Hate was launched last March to collect information on suspected cases of racially motivated violence and
harassment. (AAPI stands for Asian American Pacific Islander.) It received more than 2,808 self-reported
incidents from across the country by year’s end.
Of those incidents, 9 percent were physical assaults and 71 percent were verbal attacks. Among the victims,
most were women, and about 126 reported being older than 60.
“We were flooded immediately with hundreds of incidents,” said Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian American
studies at San Francisco State University, who helped launch the site. “We have large numbers of elderly
reporting that you wouldn’t think would complain, but they knew racism when they experienced it.”
Of the self-reported victims, 41 percent were Chinese, 15 percent were Korean, 8 percent were Vietnamese and
7 percent were Filipino. States with higher Asian populations report more incidents, with California most
represented, followed by New York at about 13 percent.
But some Asian communities suspect that the rash of attacks is even worse than the data suggests. The
tendency to underreport is why Iona Cheng thinks her community in Oakland has become a target.
“They’re attacking Asian women, often for cultural reasons. They don’t speak out. They don’t press charges.
They don’t speak English well in some cases,” said Cheng, who is Chinese American.
The 48-year-old cancer epidemiologist had just delivered a Christmas gift in late December when a group of
preteens tackled her to the ground, punched and robbed her. Police believe the same group stomped on an
Asian woman in her 60s later that night, breaking her kneecap.
“I can’t walk outside the door of my house and feel safe,” said Cheng, who added that someone called her
“coronavirus” while she was jogging last March in Oakland. “I just feel like that was taken from me.”
Gun ownership has become a solution for some. David Liu, owner of Arcadia Firearm and Safety in the
predominantly Asian city of Arcadia, Calif., said his 2020 sales soared four times higher than in a typical year.
Liu said he saw an uptick in Asian Americans interested in purchasing firearms, but interest has been
skyrocketing among “basically everybody.”
National gun sales are not tracked by race or ethnicity, but in a survey by the National Shooting Sports
Foundation last year, gun retailers estimated a nearly 43 percent average increase in sales to Asian customers
in the first half of 2020 — the smallest jump among the four reported racial or ethnic groups. By comparison,
the survey estimated an average sales increase of 52 percent to White customers and 58 percent to Black
customers.
San Francisco social worker Jason Gee decided to buy a handgun in the spring after a series of incidents that
included an assault, a home invasion and the breaking of his car windows. And on his way to buy the gun, in
the parking lot, four White men called him and his friend “the coronavirus” and “c----s.”
While in line to buy the firearm, Gee said, he noticed that most of the customers were also Asian.
But he soon started to worry that his purchase was “playing to fear” and ultimately making his community
less safe, and decided to sell the firearm back.
“If you show up here . . . expecting violence, that may put you in a certain mind frame where you may
misread a situation and respond to it with violence.”
Local leaders have made similar pleas, including Oakland Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong, who expressed
concern about civilian gun owners creating “unintended victims.”
He held a news conference on Feb. 16 after a Chinatown shopkeeper was jailed for allegedly firing his weapon
at a man he believed was robbing a woman on the street. “We don’t want people to fire weapons into our
community,” he said. “While we appreciated people’s interest in keeping our community safe, we want them
to observe and report.”
That sentiment makes San Francisco gun owner Chris Cheng furious. Cheng, who describes himself as a
Second Amendment advocate, has owned a gun since 2008 and said friends and strangers have been
reaching out to him about gun ownership in response to the attacks.
“I think a lot of Asian Americans are realizing that the police can only do so much and that the police are not
always there to protect us,” Cheng said. “They’re only there to take the report.”
Some law enforcement agencies have been trying to do more. Police departments in San Francisco and New
York City have set up task forces to focus on the issue and increased police presence in predominantly Asian
neighborhoods.
The 25 detectives on the NYPD’s all-Asian task force speak 11 languages among them. In July, when an
89-year-old woman whose face had been slapped and shirt set on fire didn’t initially cooperate with the
investigation, Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo, commanding officer of the task force, sent a detective who
speaks Cantonese to talk to her.
“She saw him, and it was like seeing her grandkids or something like that. She opened up,” Loo said. “The
details [she gave] were very precise, very clear. And from that interview, she was able to ID the people
that tried lighting her on fire, which led to an arrest.”
At least 18 people have been arrested in suspected hate crimes against Asian Americans in New York since
the attacks began in 2020, Loo said.
Many have placed blame for anti-Asian violence on former president Donald Trump, who repeatedly called
the coronavirus the “China virus” and “kung flu” during his time in office. The Anti-Defamation League
found that anti-Asian sentiment on Twitter spiked after Trump’s October covid-19 diagnosis. Even before
that, about a third of Americans in a survey released in April reported witnessing someone blame Asian
people for the pandemic.
But Rep. Mark Takano (DCalif.) says the problem runs deeper than the former president. During House
Democrats’ roundtable discussion on Feb. 19 about the attacks, Takano noted that “this sort of bias is
latent throughout American society, and it gets worse or less worse depending on the moment.”
As far back as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which banned Chinese laborers from immigrating to the
United States, insidious ideas about Asian people’s influence have fueled racist sentiments in the country.
The act was a product of the “yellow peril,” a paranoia that Chinese immigrants were a threat to White
Americans’ jobs and other aspects of Western life.
These ideas carried into the 20th century, when Chinese American Vincent Chin was fatally beaten in
Detroit in 1982 after two men allegedly mistook him for Japanese, a group that was being blamed for the
decline of U.S. automakers. Chin’s assailants received a fine and probation for his death.
Tensions between Asian and Black communities also date back decades and have been reignited by videos
that show Black perpetrators in many of the recent attacks on Asian Americans. Those tensions are rooted
in the proximity in which the two underresourced communities often live and work, while “fighting for
crumbs,” said John C. Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice in
Washington.
That mutual suspicion has boiled over several times in recent history. In 1991, a Korean American
convenience store owner in Los Angeles accused 15-year-old Latasha Harlins of shoplifting before fatally
shooting her. The shopkeeper was convicted of voluntary manslaughter but served no jail time. A year
later, the acquittal of the Los Angeles police officers who beat Rodney King set off riots in the city, during
which many Korean shops were burned and looted.
“There was a sense that the shopkeepers were not respectful of the Black clientele, didn’t trust the Black
clientele, and also overcharged the Black clientele,” said Brenda Stevenson, a history professor at UCLA
and author of “The Contested Murder of Latasha Harlins: Justice, Gender and the Origins of the L.A. Riots.”
“On the other side, the Korean American shopkeepers at the time felt that the clientele were dangerous
and untrustworthy. Some of them had been assaulted, some had been killed.”
As the coronavirus pandemic has saddled low-income communities with economic hardships, community
callouts and social media posts seeking volunteers to help protect business owners and older residents
have proliferated in Asian American neighborhoods. The volunteer patrols pass out whistles so residents
can alert others to active crimes, and offer to walk with older neighbors as they run errands.
“Our community is hurting,” said Kevin Chan, owner of Golden Gate Fortune Cookie, which has been a
stop for the San Francisco patrol. The Chinatown shop has been open for 58 years, but business has
declined by 80 percent since the pandemic, Chan said.
“Everybody is worried about what’s happening, not just me, everybody in the community,” he said.
“Because they just want to make a living and then people are attacking them just because they have a
store or they’re walking on the street.”
When it comes to anti-Asian sentiment, there are no boundaries to who could become a victim, said Tzi
Ma, known as Hollywood’s go-to Asian father. The actor, in his 60s, said he was yelled at by a passerby
in a car to “be quarantined” while in a Whole Foods parking lot in Pasadena, Calif., at the beginning of
the pandemic, before the shutdowns.
“No matter what happens to us, no matter what contributions we make,” Ma said, “all the prestige, all
the wealth that we’ve accumulated, we’re still treated the same way.”",13577
HUNDREDS GATHER TO GRIEVE OVER SLAYINGS IN GEORGIA DECRY RISE OF HATRED THAT TARGETS ASIANS,"Lauer, H.",Others,2021-03-22,"Hundreds gathered at the steps of the City-County Building in Downtown on Sunday evening for a tearful candlelight vigil remembering the victims of a shooting spree at Atlanta-area massage businesses last week that killed eight people, six of whom were Asian Americans.
Various groups of people spoke, sharing their stories of being an Asian American and sharing ways to move forward.
""We are collected here today to remember those lost to us, hold space for their lives and their stories, as well as the grief of their loved ones. We are also here to be in community together,"" said anupama jain, the executive director for Pittsburgh's Gender Equity Commission. ""This is Pittsburgh. We are a human rights city, and we will stay stronger than hate.""
The crowd, which varied in age and diversity, took up the majority of the sidewalk in front of the City-County Building, carrying signs that read ""I'm proud to be Asian American"" and ""#StopAsianHate."" Police closed down that block of Grant Street so people could maintain social distance amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Advocates and activists say the rise in attacks on Asian people in the past year is linked to rhetoric that blames Asian people for the spread of COVID-19.
One attendee, Lia Warburton 20, of Sewickley, who came with her family and their neighbors, said that even though the shooting was in Georgia, it still hits home.
""I've started carrying pepper spray when I go places, and I worry about my mom going to the Asian grocery store,"" she said. ""Because it's places like those that are targets.""
As attendees lit their candles, Itha Cao - who currently serves on Gov. Tom Wolf's Commission for Women and was a former staff member for Mayor Bill Peduto - read the names of the eight people killed in the Tuesday attack, followed by a moment of silence.
Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and Mr. Peduto both took to the podium during the vigil.
""We stand in solidarity with our Asian American friends in Atlanta. Pittsburgh is certainly no stranger to the type of racism, type of intolerance, the type of bigotry that was on display in Georgia [last] week,"" Mr. Fitzgerald said. ""Mayor Peduto and I stand here together, city and county, to say we are a welcoming region.""
""Today we stand together, in order to be able not only to call out what happened, but to demand change, "" Mr. Peduto said. ""There is no us and them. There is only us.""
Other organizations, like the Muslim Association of Greater Pittsburgh, Casa San Jose, the Pittsburgh Cultural Center and the Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh, had representatives speak as allies to the Asian American community.
Many of the speakers throughout the vigil called for solidarity and demanded change. Part of that, they said, was engaging ""difficult conversations"" that called out racist behavior and actions.
""We have to build trust and that can feel risky, but join us in making the effort, taking the risk together,"" Ms. jain said. ""We are just a small example of all the people who will stand together.""

Atlanta killings spur Bates College president to defend Asian Americans,None,Others,2021-03-18,"The president of Bates College denounced “anti-Asian discrimination and hate crimes” in the wake of “a horrific series of violent attacks in Atlanta” that killed eight people, including six Asian women.
“The events of this week are yet one more bleak reminder that each of us and all of us together are called to bear witness against the violence of racism, to act for justice and to affirm our shared humanity,” Bates President Clayton Spencer said in a message to the college community.
Spencer said, “Anti-Asian bias has reached disturbing levels” across the country, citing statistics that show 3,800 hate incidents have occurred in the past year toward Asians, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
The reported cases, she said, represent only “a small fraction of total incidents,” including some that have happened in Maine and to people with ties to Bates. She said incidents are occurring with “distressing frequency.”
“Asian-identified members of the Bates community have shared with me that they have had direct and personal exposure to these kinds of frightening and deeply harmful experiences at home, on campus and throughout their lives,” she said.
“They also suffer the stress of living in a time and a nation where every day holds the threat of dehumanizing interactions, concern about loved ones, and even physical violence,” Spencer said.
“Whether these acts take the form of verbal harassment, shunning, physical assault, workplace discrimination, refusal of service or online bullying,” she said, “their goal is to undermine the fundamental rights, dignity and belonging of those they target.”

"Social, political actions called for to counter surging Asian hate in U.S.",None,Others,2021-03-29,"The root causes of hate against Asian Americans were the prejudice and the desire to treat other people like objects or take ""people different from you as not your own flesh and blood,"" says Ray Low, a Manhattan pastor.NEW YORK, March 28 (Xinhua) -- To highlight ""StopAsianHate"" and demand thorough regulation, multiple marches and demonstrations erupted almost in unison on Saturday in over 60 U.S. cities, including New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland and Atlanta, where the gun rampage on March 16 left eight dead at three spas, six of them Asian women.The shooting spree in State Georgia, together with a rising wave of similar-nature incidents over the past year, have shocked many Asian Americans across the nation, and led to the alarm, grief and fear of Asian-hate crime tides amid this COVID-19 pandemic era.The heinous slaying has particularly further sparked both a sense of heightened activism from within the Asian American community and broad-based support from beyond, mirroring a burning public desire to fight the wide-ranging racial discriminations in this so-called beacon country of democracy.People attend a rally against racism and violence on Asian Americans in Flushing of New York, the United States, March 27, 2021.

These figures and estimates give a clear explanation why the current ""StopAsianHate"" marches and demonstrations has been so strong and wide-ranging.""It's really important and meaningful that we have had such widespread support from all over the country,"" said Grace Meng. ""As an Asian American born and raised here, I have never felt that in my entire life.

In addition, after the Atlanta killings, Biden's administration is also under pressure to take action on gun control via executive orders.",9908
#StopAsianHate: Township residents speak out about anti-Asian racism,"Lassonde, M.",Others,2021-03-30,"Since the start of the pandemic, people of Asian descent have been spat on, verbally harassed, assaulted, and accused of bringing COVID-19 to Canada.
These incidents are anchored in a damaging and racist rhetoric against the Asian community and have been fuelled by comments declaring COVID-19 the ""Chinese virus"" from politicians, including former U.S. President Donald Trump.
But these racist incidents are far from being an American issue. According to Project 1907, Canada has a higher number of reported anti-Asian hate crime incidents per Asian Capita compared to the U.S.
""I completely isolated myself because I was scared of what could happen to me if I left my house,"" admitted Enola St-Amant, who was adopted by a Quebecois family at 13 months old.
St-Amant is one of many Asian-Canadians who have been verbally assaulted and discriminated against since the rise of cases started in Wuhan. She recalls feeling this looming disdain against the Asian community in February, 2020 when people would actively avoid her and her Asian friends in the streets or in public transit.
Perhaps the most traumatizing event, however, was when an individual physically blocked her from entering a Granby grocery store out of fear she would infect shoppers.
""They just assumed I had COVID because I was Asian,"" said St-Amant.
A similar fear also manifested itself in another shopper who actively prevented her from touching the products inside the grocery store. A few weeks later, while talking to an Asian clerk, St-Amant was accosted by a woman who told her she was the reason people needed to wear masks.
""It got to a point where I stopped going to the grocery store,"" admitted St-Amant. ""It was just so frustrating because every time I would leave the house, something would happen.""
This is a sentiment many Asian-Canadians and Asian immigrants have come to know in the past months and is validated by the growing number of anti-Asian crimes in Canada.
A report from the Chinese Canadian National Council (CCNC) claimed there had been 1,150 instances of anti-Asian racism between March 10, 2020, and Feb. 28, 2021, most of which were experienced by young adults between the ages of 19 to 35, St-Amant's age bracket.
""Racism against Asian people has always been very silent because people don't realize they are being racist,"" said St-Amant. ""People often assume it is okay to be rude because we won't fight back.""
Perhaps the most notable act of anti-Asian hate crimes was the recent Atlanta Spa Shootings, which sparked a variety of #StopAsianHate rallies across North America, including last week's protest in Montreal.
For St-Amant, however, these protests began a little too late and have come and gone far too quietly.
""The protest was barely covered,"" said St-Amant. ""My friends didn't even know it had happened.""
Ri Ju, who moved to Canada from South Korea four years ago, echoed this sentiment when speaking with The Record. To her, the lack of reporting surrounding anti-Asian racism is a saddening realization that discrimination against Asian people is almost invalidated because of white people's appreciation for Asian food, culture, and art.
Ju added she is particularly disappointed in how Western society actively consumes Korean music and television shows, such as K-Drama or Anime, but often turns a blind eye to racism.
""Asian culture is very trendy right now,"" said Ju. ""But often, they don't expand their interest to include protecting Asian people and Asian rights.""
While Ju said she did not personally experience instances of discrimination because of her Korean nationality, she confessed she experienced a similar fear of leaving her home when she began to hear of anti-Asian attacks in Montreal, such as the attack on Koreans in the Plateau region.
Racism does not stop at verbal or physical attacks. It also encompasses microaggressions, such as asking ""where are you really from,"" to an Asian-Canadian citizen. Ju added she felt it was particularly insulting for her Asian heritage to be boiled down to being either Chinese or Japanese and she considers these comments ""ignorant of other Asian countries.""
""The Asian community is still very small in [the Townships], so it is normal for people to not be very informed when it comes to Asian values and rights,"" said Ju. ""But they need to be made aware of the racism we face.""
While it is true that the Asian community in the Townships is considerably smaller than in Montreal, both St-Amant and Ju stress the importance of educating yourself on damaging prejudices. One of which, according to St-Amant is the hypersexualization of Asian women.
""My ex-boyfriend would often compare me to a sex worker and his friends would comment on my body because I was Asian,"" explained St-Amant. ""Why should I be even more sexualized than I already am?"" According to Ju, while protests allow for more media coverage and to raise awareness to anti-Asian racism, she believes the Quebec political system needs fixing from the inside-out. This could be as simple as actively seeking out Asian voices when it comes to decision-making and encouraging generations of young Asian-Canadians to pursue political careers.
""I have noticed the Asian community is often forgotten whenever there are anti-racism seminars,"" said Ju. ""I hope this [movement] will push local organizations and the media to elevate Asian voices.""

Rise in violence against Asian Americans decried in Sonoma County,"Johnson, J.",Others,2021-03-18,"Over dinner at Flamez Grill in Petaluma Wednesday, Elizabeth Barbosa and her mother confided they worry for the other’s safety.
The mass shooting at three massage businesses Tuesday in the Atlanta area left eight people dead, six of them Asian women. The suspect claimed he was frustrated over a sexual addiction, authorities said.
The shooting was a horror, but it did not shock many Asian American residents of Sonoma County interviewed Thursday. They have watched with anxious attention as a rise in crimes targeting Asian Americans, especially elders, have been reported across the Bay Area. They have felt the jabs from former President Donald Trump, who publicly described the coronavirus in racist terms — like the “Kung flu.“
That was already enough to move Barbosa, 29, a Filipina-American, to help organize a demonstration denouncing anti-Asian violence in February at Old Courthouse Square in downtown Santa Rosa.
So when news came out of Georgia that a 21-year-old white man opened fire at not one but three massage spas, there was no question in her mind that the violence was rooted in a toxic mix of racism and misogyny long aimed at Asian women.
“My mother did warn me on the side of caution, ’Just please be careful,’” Barbosa said. “My ethnicity might represent something to another person’s eye, so I have to be more careful. I’m livid about that, truthfully.”
Just last week, Santa Rosa Junior College trustees passed a resolution to demonstrate solidarity with Asian American Pacific Islander communities, a statement meant to counter recent violence and a sense that “the recent epidemic of COVID-19 has been falsely blamed on AAPI individuals.”
SRJC president Frank Chong draws a direct line from that hateful rhetoric to the violence in Georgia.
“Messages put out by our former president have hurt, and they have been a call to action for hate groups,” Chong said in an interview.
Violence hit home in November for Chong and his family when his older brother was attacked in Oakland by four youths who took his phone and tried to steal his car, according to Chong. His brother is 73, has Parkinson’s disease and cancer, and no longer feels safe leaving his house.
The assault felt like a flashback to the mid-1980s when Chong helped organize community meetings in Oakland to help stem violence targeted at refugees from Asia who had come to the Bay Area. Chong said he is deeply concerned to hear the murders in Atlanta aren’t being treated as hate crimes mired in America’s long history of discrimination against Asian people.
“We feel under siege right now. It’s shaken us to our core,” Chong said. “For the first time I feel wary about going out. Will I be insulted and marginalized?”
The shooter has been charged with eight counts of murder but no hate crimes. A spokesman for the Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office drew ire after describing the day of the shooting as the result of “a really bad day” for the suspect. The spokesman had also previously posted images of T-shirts on social media echoing Trump’s anti-Asian rhetoric, calling the coronavirus an “imported virus from Chy-na,” according to the New York Times.
Petaluma resident Kimi Stout, 35, quit her server job at the Girl & the Fig restaurant in Sonoma last month after she said she was told she couldn’t wear a mask with the words “Black Lives Matter” on it.
Stout said she felt it was essential to make a stand at a time when the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor had surfaced the deep grief of Black America. Tuesday’s violence in Atlanta felt deeply personal and “devastating,” said Stout, who is Chinese-Filipina American.
“It’s almost as devastating to hear people say, ’We asked him if it was racially motivated and he said no,’ ” Stout said. “To take his word for it? For an officer of the law to excuse him as having a bad day? It doesn’t surprise me that something like this happened.”
Bodega Bay resident Jon Yatabe, 83, said he fears the violence shows that the country has not progressed far enough away from the kind of racism that led to the internment of the Japanese during World War II.
Yatabe was about 5 years old in 1942 when his family, who had a flower business in Redwood City, was imprisoned, and forced to move into the horse stables at Tanforan Racetrack in San Bruno. They were later shipped to the Topaz War Relocation Center in Utah while his father joined the 442nd Infantry Regiment, sent to the front lines of the European theater.
Yatabe said the last year has revived that sense of fear and insecurity that pervaded the fabric of life when he was a child. He became worried for his son, an attorney in Colorado near reports of anti-Asian violence.
“I hear about violence like that, and I just think back on all violence against all minorities, not just Asians, violence against blacks, against Latinos,” Yatabe said. “It brings back a fear that the country hasn’t really progressed from where we once were.”
Santa Rosa mother Chantavy Tornado helped Escalante organize February’s anti-Asian violence demonstration in Santa Rosa.
Tuesday, Tornado said she was talking on the phone with Rohnert Park City Vice Mayor Jackie Elward, who was recently called racial slurs by an anonymous caller who told her to “go back to Africa,” when she started receiving messages about the mass shooting in Atlanta.
One week earlier, Tornado, who is Khmer and the daughter of survivors of Cambodia’s killing fields, was walking with her 7-year-old son on West Third Street when someone driving past cursed at them and yelled a racial slur used against Chinese people.
A lifetime of experiences, including the deep betrayal of a white man who abused Tornado as a child, made the news hard to bear. She turned on some music and cried.
Now Tornado said she’s ready to speak out and call for all people in Sonoma County to take a strong, public stance against violence because of the many ways these injustices are allowed to continue in private.
“It’s a different floor plan in Sonoma County. We can’t do it alone, there’s only 2% of us in this community,” Tornado said, referring to the Asian population here. “We need a mass healing in so many ways.”

Residents react to anti-Asian crime: Three perceptions after Atlanta-area shootings,"Guan, N.",Others,2021-03-21,"""I love downtown. It's a beautiful place to walk around,"" said Kay Kim, a longtime resident of Savannah, ""but now I'm scared to go.""
In all 38 years of living in Savannah, Georgia, Kim, a Korean American, has not felt this kind of hypervigilance until now. With the rise of Anti-Asian violence across the U.S. and, most recently, the shooting deaths of eight people in the Atlanta area, six of whom were Asian women, she says she and others can't be too cautious.
""Even in Savannah you never know,"" said Kim. After hearing of the shooting incident Kim texted her children, ""be careful wherever you go, it's a scary world now.""
But hate and discrimination have always lurked in the shadows and, throughout specific moments in history, bubbled up to the surface. Lawmakers in the past week have echoed the same sentiment, reminding people that this is nothing new.
""It's senseless,"" said Kim -- a word she falls back on repeatedly.
For many in the Asian community, making sense of this violence and the motives behind each incident feels futile. The rise in violence against Asians has generally been attributed to racist rhetoric surrounding the pandemic, but not all crimes have been labeled as hate crimes.
That includes the shooting deaths in Atlanta by the suspect Robert Aaron Long, a 21-year-old white man who told police his sex addiction compelled him to attack two spas that he frequented. Police have not yet determined that Long ""specifically targeted"" his victims, but experts say it is hard to separate the crime from race.
Authorities say the suspect opened fire at Young's Asian Massage in Acworth, Georgia on Tuesday evening, killing four people and injuring a fifth, before driving 30 miles into Atlanta and killing four more people at two businesses, Gold Spa and Aromatherapy Spa. Long was arrested about 150 miles south of Atlanta. Police said he was heading to Florida and intended to carry out more shootings at spas there.
One thing is certain: Many Asian Americans are left with a feeling of vulnerability, a feeling that increases each time someone of Asian descent is assaulted on the streets or killed.
Each story is a harbinger of what could come.
Kim, who attends a local Asian church in Savannah, says her whole congregation is scared. In conversation, she oscillates between feeling anxiety about the recent violent events, but also faith that the world is still beautiful.
""It doesn't have to be this way,"" she says. ""It's a beautiful America, a blessed country. We shouldn't ruin it with these kinds of acts.""
\ There's a Clash
""You do know what it's like to be a misfit,"" says an Asian American woman and Savannah business owner whose concern for her safety is so great that she did not want to be identified for this story.
She was born in and grew up in the U.S. and has always recognized a disconnect between her ethnic identity and her American one. She recalls moments from childhood when no one would want to sit next to her or the other Asian kids on the school bus.
""It happened every day,"" she reminisces, ""And you hear that all the time: 'You don't belong. You're from another country.'""
It's been decades since that time in her life and she now boasts of a multicultural family full of love and chatter. Between her family and friends, there's a representative from every country, she jokes. ""It would always be just like, the world was in the living room,"" she says.
But even so, there are moments when she feels hostility from this world again.
She rattles off all the broadcast news channels she watches. She remembers seeing the coverage on Vicha Ratanapakdee in late January, a Thai man who was shoved to the ground in San Francisco and later died from his injuries.
""It's kind of a little bit of that all over again,"" she says, ""there's a clash within myself and I see the clash outside in the world now.""
\ Endless Patience
An Nguyen, a retired respiratory therapist and Vietnam War veteran, settled in Savannah in the mid 70s. He now runs the Chùa Cát Tuong Temple in Garden City, which sits on acres of green space. It's a stark difference from their two-bedroom cottage 20 years ago and Nguyen is proud of how far he has come.
As Nguyen lists off decades of accomplishments, it's clear he's motivated by wearing several hats in the community, working with church leaders in Garden City and mobilizing his neighbors to fill out the 2020 census. He then starts on another list of all the places he's lived and visited: San Antonio, Dallas, Washington D.C., San Francisco. But when asked why he ended up in Savannah, Nguyen says it's because it reminds him of his distant home.
""The weather is almost like Vietnam,"" he says. ""The river, the water, the ocean.""
But most of all, Nguyen says it's because of the people.
""When I came here, I don't have anything after the war. And they helped me...hold my hand, guide me on what to do,"" he said.
Nguyen believes he has more friends than enemies. In the midst of the country's current strife, he urges unity.
""We are in the United States of America,"" he said. ""We need to live together, work together."" It's why he and so many other immigrants come to this country in the first place, he said. That same hope, even in the face of violent racism, holds together their vision of what this country should be, but isn't.
""Every day I think I make people smile,"" says Nguyen.
When people accuse him of bringing COVID-19 to America, he says he corrects them with a smile too. ""I'm Vietnamese. My life's work was working in healthcare. When people are dying, I'm the one who comes to rescue them,"" he says.
His endless patience is palpable.
A string of violent attacks on Asian elders across the country has littered the news for months. But nothing can make Nguyen doubt who he is or make him doubt that he belongs.

Oakland’s Chinatown finds solutions to hate crimes,None,Others,2021-03-11,"Sakhone Lasaphangthong wants people to notice him.“Oh, they know it’s me,” he said while walking the streets of Oakland’s Chinatown. “I’m almost 6-foot, bald-
headed, with glasses on. You know when they see me, I stand out.”He sees this as a good thing. He wants people to ask him for help.

Sakhone is the director of housing services at Family Bridges, a nonprofit in Oakland, California, and he’s also
part of the area's Community Ambassador program.
Community ambassadors walk the streets of Chinatown to care for the neighborhood and help residents feel
safe. They do things like sweep sidewalks, fix kids’ bikes and help with vaccine clinics.
Attacks against Asian Americans have increased across the country over the last year - including racial slurs shouted in public, kids bullied in schools, and most recently, the unpredictable attacks on older Asian Americans.
Some say the uptick can be linked to rhetoric used by former President Donald Trump, who dubbed the
coronavirus the “China virus” in public remarks.
An 84-year old man from Thailand was attacked and knocked to the ground during his morning walk in San
Francisco. He died two days later. In another incident, a 61-year-old Filipino American was slashed in the face on
the New York City subway.
Oakland's Chinatown has also seen attacks like this. In a virtual tour of the area via FaceTime, Sakhone shows
the spot where a 91-year-old man was shoved to the ground a few weeks ago. He said he regrets that he wasn’t
there to help.
“Yeah, if I see them fall down, I'll rush to help,” Sakhone said. “I always keep an eye on them.”

------------
Sakhone walks the streets of Chinatown every morning as shopkeepers set up their fruit stands and seniors take
their morning strolls. He greets many of them by name.
A grocer runs over to give him a bag of fresh oranges when he spots Sakhone coming down the street. Take it,
he gestures with his hands. Sakhone will share it when he brings a cup of coffee to a man sleeping on the
streets a few blocks away.
Most residents here speak Cantonese, but Sakhone, whose family is from Laos, does not. Yet, they still manage
to communicate by tapping him on the shoulder or waving him over when they need help - like the time an
elderly woman had her walker stolen.
Sakhone and the woman went in search of it together but her knee buckled every few steps as they canvassed
the streets. Eventually, he bought her a new walker, he recalled.
“A lot of folks are worried. ... But at the same time, when I'm around, they know that I'm there to help look
over them.”
Sakhone Lasaphangthong, community ambassador, Chinatown, Oakland, California
“A lot of folks are worried,” Sakhone said, and some older residents aren’t even leaving their homes with the
rise in attacks. “But at the same time, when I'm around, they know that I'm there to help look over them.”
Just the presence of ambassadors like Sakhone seems to make a difference.

But building this kind of trust took time given that the Community Ambassadors initiative didn’t start as a
neighborhood watch program. It started in 2017 to help give former inmates from San Quentin prison the
opportunity to do dignified work and rebuild relationships with the community.
------------
Sakhone had been incarcerated for 20 years before he was released in 2018. To stop crime, he said you need to
know why it happens. He explained how in the pandemic, people have lost their jobs, rent prices in Oakland and
elsewhere have skyrocketed, and many people have lost their homes, too. All these stresses can compound
mental health.
“They have no right to do it, but it's like one way that folks express their traumas and their hurt or their pain
is to take it out on people,” Sakhone said. “And it's not right. But the pandemic is hard for every community -
it's hard for everyone.”

A special police task force is being developed to address hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific
Islanders in Oakland. But some community members say that in reality, most people here won’t call the
police given a history of mistrust and lack of response.
“I don't believe in more policing, I believe in more communication so that we could avoid these kinds of hate
crimes from happening.""
Sakhone Lasaphangthong, community ambassador, Chinatown, Oakland, California
“I don't believe in more policing, I believe in more communication so that we could avoid these kinds of hate
crimes from happening,” Sakhone said.
Many residents want justice for hate crime victims, while advocates like Sakhone believe in restorative
justice. When he sees conflict or tension, he tries to deescalate the situation by understanding the
perspectives of all those involved.
“One of my approaches is to ask if they're OK. You know, 'What's going on? What do you need?'” he said.
Once home to immigrants and working-class families, the neighborhoods around Chinatown are gentrifying
and now boast luxury condos, as well. Some locals say that people don’t know each other, and don't look out
for each other the way they used to. Rebuilding these relationships, they say, would help make the
neighborhood safer.

------------
Beyond the noodle shops, fruit stands, some of the best dim sum in the Bay area, and a church with closed
doors and a quiet playground, there’s Madison Park, where a dozen elders perform their morning tai chi.
Here, Sakhone’s friend, Lee Zitsue, another community ambassador, waited for a grandmother shopping for
groceries nearby, so he could walk her home.
They often say they’ll take 15-20 minutes, but it’s more like 30-40 minutes, he chuckled.
When he went to pick her up at the store where she’d been shopping though, he couldn’t find her.
“Oh man, now you got me scared,” Lee said. “I’m scared that she got lost. It’s just the opportunity for crime
is so high.”
Lee went out to look for her and learned later that she had left on her own, eager to get back home.
With the weather getting warmer and people getting vaccinated, Chinatown will grow busier soon. Some fear
this means they’ll see more hate crime, so the ambassadors say they’re looking for more volunteers.

Missouri Asian American groups condemn Branson lawmaker's use of 'Chinese virus',"Benchaabane, N. ",Others,2021-03-18,"ST. LOUIS -- Local groups representing Americans of Asian descent on Wednesday condemned a Branson-area state representative's use last week of the phrase ""Chinese virus,"" saying it is language helping fuel a wave of hate crimes against Asian Americans.
Rep. Brian Seitz, a Branson Republican, used the phrase on March 9 during discussion in the Missouri House about state revenues and a bill that would allow the state to collect sales taxes from online retailers that don't have a physical presence in the state.
""While the zombie apocalypse has seen a shortage of revenue for the state, I remind the body that the Chinese virus has not shut down one business,"" Seitz said. ""Government has shut down businesses and created this shortfall.""
On Wednesday, four groups representing business leaders, attorneys and other Missouri residents of Asian descent condemned the use of the phrase.
""The use of this dog whistle is simply unacceptable, and we demand it end,"" the Asian American Bar Association of Kansas City, St. Louis Asian American Chamber of Commerce, Missouri Asian American Bar Association, and the Organization of Chinese Americans in St. Louis said in a joint statement. ""The continued use of the term is at best willful blindness to the effect these words have, or at worst, deliberate use of racist rhetoric for political gain at the expense of Asian Americans.""
Seitz did not respond to a request for comment.
The condemnation came the morning after a gunman killed eight people, at least six of them women of Asian descent, at three Atlanta-area massage parlors. The 21-year-old Georgia man charged in the eight murders, Robert Aaron Long, told the police that he had a ""sexual addiction,"" but investigators have not ruled out bias as a motivating factor, the New York Times reported.
The shootings were widely condemned Wednesday by prominent U.S. civil liberties and Asian American groups who have raised alarms about bigotry against Asian Americans that spiked as cases of the coronavirus spread in the U.S., fueled by the news that COVID-19 first appeared in China and former President Donald Trump's and other Republicans' use of the phrase ""China virus.""
Over the past year, thousands of incidents of abuse have been reported to an anti-hate group that tracks incidents against Asian Americans, and hate crimes in general are at the highest level in more than a decade.
Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition of Asian American advocacy groups, issued a report in August stating that it had received thousands of reports of hate and discrimination across the country since the group was founded in March, around the time the outbreak began to seriously worsen in the U.S.
The day after Seitz used the phrase, Rep. Emily Weber, D-Kansas City, filed an internal complaint with House human resources.
Weber, who was born in South Korea and adopted and raised in Kansas, said the term ""denigrates, stigmatizes and dehumanizes people who look like me.""
The Asian American groups that condemned Seitz's use of phrase Wednesday said they expect Seitz to ""seek out the appropriate education and guidance to gain understanding.""

Anti-Asian violence airs absurdity of defunding,None,Others,2021-03-16,"There's an old saying about traditions: Abandon a tradition, it tells us, and you will soon learn why it became
one.
That's what California cities are learning today, as city councils around the state have acted on the urging of
Black Lives Matter protesters and diverted portions of their former police budgets to social action causes in
previously underserved neighborhoods.
But the spate of anti-Asian violence now playing out in California communities as disparate as Sacramento, San
Jose, Los Angeles, San Leandro and Orange County dramatically shows this was folly.
The logical police response to on-street attacks ought to be more foot and squad car patrols, but that's not
happening in most places despite the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes. So they continue, showing no signs of
abating.
Before the coronavirus pandemic, this was not a big problem. Hate crimes against Asians were relatively few
and far between. But a huge upswing began just about the time ex-President Donald Trump dubbed the
coronavirus plague the ""Chinese virus,"".
Around California, these crimes have far more than doubled over the last year, but no one can put a precise
number on them. In San Francisco, they have at least tripled. In Los Angeles, there have been more than twice
as many this year as a year ago. But official numbers are likely far lower than in real life, partly because police don't do much about the attacks.
Not even 700-person rallies decrying the attacks, like one the other day in San Jose, can stop them.
The head of a Southern California group called Asian-Americans Advancing Justice told one reporter many such
crimes go unreported because of language problems, immigrants unable to communicate with police. Plus, she
said, ""When victims...come forward, having the police say nothing can be done discourages other victims from
relying on police.""
Some immigrant advocates also say Korean-Americans and other Asian groups are perceiving new bias among
police officers, perhaps caused by the Trump rhetoric.
But the mere presence of cops on street patrol could have stopped one early March assault on an elderly Asian
man who was seated in a Nob Hill laundromat in San Francisco when at attacker ambushed him. Police presence
probably would have spared the death of Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thai-American beaten to death in
broad daylight, also in San Francisco.
Neither of their assailants has been identified, like most others conducting the current spate of attacks.
There are also less violent, but still threatening incidents. One Asian-American woman stopped at a red light the
other day in Fresno and a man in the next car signaled she should roll down her window. When she did, he
shouted, ""Get out of my country — that's an order."" After pausing, he reportedly added, ""I'll kill you.""
All this is a demonstration that even a ""model minority"" noted for high achievement and founding large andsuccessful businesses of many types can suddenly be targeted, especially when national leaders become loose-
lipped about their own prejudices.It also shows that not only California, but the entire nation needs effective policing to protect minorities who
have no way to know when they might be victimized, even if their particular ethnic group enjoys generally high
public esteem.
Because bigots have always picked on those they see as weak, this is especially important for elderly and frail
individuals.
Yes, the pandemic appears to have originated in or near the Chinese city of Wuhan. But there is no evidence it
was deliberately perpetrated on the world. The claim that it was amounts to a blood libel against Chinese
individuals who would have been thousands of miles away even if deeds like this had been done.
Because most others have difficulty discerning Asians' native nationalities simply from their appearance, all
Asian-Americans are now at serious risk, especially if they don't look strong, a la the Los Angeles Angels' 6-foot,
4-inch, 210 pound Shohei Otani.
Police are their only assured protection from random violence and bigotry when they leave their homes. And the
fewer cops on the street, the more danger for them. Which is just one reason it makes little sense to defund
police, as Americans are now discovering.",4257
Asian-Americans leaving US amid rising hate crimes: Pandemic and violent racism cause Americans of Vietnamese heritage to reconsider land of refuge,"Sen Nguyen, S. N.,THANH HUONG. ",Others,2021-03-31,"Six years ago, Christina Bui, who was born in the US state of Virginia to a family of Vietnamese immigrants, accepted a job in Ho Chi Minh City. Her mother was appalled.
""My dad was 'whatever' [about it] but my mom was furious, giving me the whole 'I came to America to give you a better life!' speech,"" the 28-year-old recalled about her move to the city also known as Saigon.
But amid recent incidents of violence against Asians, the Trump administration's mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic and the violent mob attack on Capitol Hill in January, Bui is among the Vietnamese-Americans who are mulling over their feelings about the country that once offered their families refuge from war and poverty.
The United States has long been seen by migrants as a land of better opportunities, including the 123,000 Vietnamese who fled Saigon in the years after it fell to North Vietnamese troops in 1975. Five years later, the Refugee Act resulted in over 1.1 million Southeast Asian refugees, including those from Laos and Cambodia, resettling in the US.
But for Bui, whose work at a non-profit foundation focuses on anti-human trafficking efforts, Vietnam's proactive approach to the coronavirus is one reason for it being a safer place to call home. Vietnam has had 2,500 cases and 35 deaths among its 97 million population compared to America's 30.2 million cases and nearly 549,000 deaths among its 330 million population.
""It's just weird to me that I feel safer here in the country that my parents fled, than I probably would back home in the US, because of the pandemic, and also because I don't have to think about blending in or the colour of my skin and therefore I'm not treated outrageously different,"" Bui said.
Jenni Trang Le, a Vietnamese-American whose parents fled Saigon by plane, said she felt a sense of ""survival guilt"" for living in Ho Chi Minh City and not being part of the trauma of the pandemic and rising anti-Asian discrimination her family and friends were experiencing in the US.
""When I try to explain [anti-Asian racism] to Vietnamese people, they can understand it intellectually, not emotionally, because they have not experienced it,"" said the head producer at a regional entertainment firm.
Hate crimes against Asians have soared over the past year. While rights advocates said this stemmed from a long history of discrimination, recent incidents have been fuelled by Asian-Americans being linked to Covid-19, which was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei province.
Yen Le Espiritu, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of California San Diego, said Asian-Americans had been ""racialised in the US as the perpetual foreigner and as the model minority"".
Asian-Americans felt that no matter how assimilated they were, they would always be perceived as ""tangential to US history, and as foreign, not American"".
Asians were also seen as a model minority – a stereotype portraying them as intelligent, hardworking and prosperous – that pitted them against African-Americans protesting against racial injustice and made them ""invisible in discussions on race/racism"" compared to the black community, Espiritu said. But Asian-Americans were also especially vulnerable to both verbal and physical racial attacks from both whites and from other communities of colour, she added.",3309
Fil-Am coach Erik Spoelstra: Hate attacks 'heartbreaking and sickening',None,Others,2021-03-20,"Manila, March 20 -- Heat coach Erik Spoelstra has condemned racism towards Asian-Americans amid the recent Atlanta shooting that killed eight people, including six Asian women.
""Look, I'm Asian-American. I'm proud to be Asian-American,"" Spoelstra said prior to coaching Miami against the Indiana Pacers.
""And seeing what's happening with another. just outright form of racism and hatred really is sickening and breaks my heart. It's despicable. I think more people have to be made aware of this. It really is irrelevant, y'know, who you are or what you are, you have to see that this is wrong.""
The Filipino-American coach also lauded the NBA for speaking out on the issue on their behalf.
Spoelstra aired his sentiments in light of the increasing hate attacks in the United States, even after one year since the COVID-19 pandemic started in Wuhan, China, which also added fuel to the fire as far as racial discrimination is concerned.
For Spoelstra, the first Asian-American coach in the NBA, the ""heartbreaking"" events in their country are proof that ""hatred abundantly [is] still out there and people feel empowered to attack the Asian community.""
The 50-year-old champion coach, who is also one of the most vocal NBA personalities, furthered that he will ""pray in my heart that this can stop.""
Fil-Am Jazz guard Jordan Clarkson, Lakers star LeBron James, Heat great Dwyane Wade, and former NBA player Jeremy Lin were also in unison that these hate attacks must stop.
The suspect, identified as Robert Aaron Long, 21, is now detained and charged with eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault.

Attacks put LI Asians on guard: Say nationwide assaults have made them cautious about leaving their homes,"Zou, D.",Others,2021-03-14,"Attacks in recent weeks against Asians on the West Coast and in New York City have put Long Islanders like Kathy Wong on edge and
more on guard.
The New Hyde Park mother of three watched in horror the recent footage of an Asian woman being shoved to the ground outside a
bakery in Queens.
""I saw her starting to back up. The fear was already there before she was pushed,"" Wong recalled of seeing the video in February on
the evening news. ""When he pushed her with such force [to] the ground, I automatically thought of my own mother. I automatically
thought of my daughter.""
Violent assaults nationwide in the past two months have intensified fears among some Asian Americans on the Island. Some grew so
concerned over the safety of vulnerable elders that they are advising them to avoid public transportation and are limiting their own
trips outdoors, and have kept their children at home to learn remotely on top of worries of COVID-19 risks.
During a prime-time speech Thursday night to mark the start of the one-year anniversary of the global coronavirus pandemic,
President Joe Biden condemned ""vicious hate crimes against Asian Americans who've been attacked, harassed, blamed and
scapegoated"" during the pandemic.
""It's wrong, it's un-American and it must stop,"" he said.
Suffolk County police said they are investigating two reports of hate incidents with Asian victims but reported no cases of violent
assaults targeting Asians. In one case, police said an Asian employee of a liquor store in Brentwood received ""a threatening phone
call based on his race/ethnicity"" last April. In another, anti-Asian graffiti was painted on the rear door of a Selden business in
September. Both are under investigation.
Nassau police said they received no reports of anti-Asian hate crimes in the past year but handled a bias incident last June in Jericho
where one woman used an expletive before calling the other woman ""Chinese,"" to which the victim, who is Asian, responded that her ethnicity was not Chinese.
Violent attacks increase
Nationwide, reports of violent attacks against Asians have surged this year.
An 84-year-old Thai man died after he was thrown to the pavement in San Francisco in January. A 91-year-old man was injured after
being shoved in Oakland's Chinatown. In Manhattan, a man came up behind a 36-year-old Asian man walking on a street in
Chinatown and stabbed him in the torso, leaving the victim hospitalized in critical condition. The woman whose assault in Flushing so
frightened Wong was treated with stitches for a gash on her forehead. Earlier this week, a 75-year-old Asian man was robbed during
a stroll in Oakland that left him seriously injured. From 2019 to 2020, the NYPD reported a jump from three to 28 hate crime
incidents involving Asians.
Kevin Sun, co-president of the Great Neck Chinese Association, said he has heard a handful of first-person accounts where drivers in
passing cars hurled racial slurs at Asians walking on the street with their groceries.
The recent attacks prompted Vivian Luk, of Albertson, to tell her mother to avoid taking the Long Island Rail Road to travel to
Flushing for a doctor's appointment last month. Her mother ended up taking a cab.
""It feels like it's stripping away our freedom. ... It angers me, obviously. It worries me even more,"" said Luk, 41, who emigrated from
Hong Kong to the United States when she was a child. ""I feel like we can't freely walk around. I feel like I'm going to be a target.""
Luk is not alone in worrying about staying safe on public transportation. Shaorui Li, chair of the Asian American Association of
Greater Stony Brook, remembered reading about Asian women being attacked on subway trains and at train platforms.
""It triggers fear,"" said Li, of Setauket. ""Some of my friends commute to the city. Their family members became scared [of] what
could happen at subway stations.""
Some advocates and experts have tied the rise in anti-Asian crime during the pandemic to the economic downturn, geopolitical
tensions and the rhetoric of politicians like former President Donald Trump, who repeatedly called COVID-19 a ""Chinese virus.""
""We've seen racism during times of war, pandemic and economic downturn. Last year, we saw all three,"" said Russell Jeung, a
professor at San Francisco State University and co-founder of STOP AAPI HATE, a national database that collects self-reported hate
incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
""We had the worst recession since the Great Depression. And we had the U.S.-China Cold War,"" Jeung said. ""Then again President
Trump's rhetoric inflamed hatred and gave people the license to push and shove others.""
Since March, Jeung's group has documented more than 3,000 complaints, including 16 cases of verbal harassment, shunning and
being barred from establishments on Long Island as of the end of February.
""There's widespread worry over safety,"" said Weiwei Zhang, of Mt. Sinai, a board member of the Suffolk County Asian American
Advisory Board, in Mandarin. ""As far as I'm aware of, there are no attacks on individuals here in Suffolk. But people are becoming
more careful about when and where they go.""
Farrah Mozawalla, executive director of Nassau County's Office of Asian American Affairs, said her office has received reports of about
a half- dozen anti-Asian harassment incidents since last March, including a Filipino woman being told to go back to her country in a
Costco in Nassau County.
""With these anti-Asian sentiments ... people are apprehensive,"" Mozawalla said. ""They feel uncomfortable. They feel like they don't
belong. We want to make sure that they know they are part of the county.""
A ""Stand Up to Hate"" rally is scheduled for 11 a.m. Sunday outside the Nassau County Legislative Building in Mineola.
Painful memories
For those who have endured the sting of racism and marginalization, the wave of anti-Asian discrimination has evoked painful
memories and opened new wounds.
When Wong was about 8, she said her family heard a loud bang on the door one night at their house in Bayside, Queens. When her
parents opened the door, the family saw newspapers lit on fire in front of their doorstep. It wasn't until they put the fire out that they
realized that the newspapers were wrapped around feces.
""That was such a difficult thing to experience as a child because you realize there are people that don't like you just for the way
you look,"" said Wong, who is in her 40s.
Growing up, she said people used racial slurs toward her and made assumptions about the language she spoke - even though
English is her first language - that Wong said sent her a clear message.
""Being born here and just looking different ... and then being berated for that made it clear that I did not belong,"" she said.
Last week, Lucy Wu, 42, of Manhasset, said she was sprayed by windshield washer fluid during an unprovoked encounter as a man
drove away from the parking lot of a Manhasset grocery store. No words were exchanged between them, and Wu said she did not
report it to police.
""There was mist all over my face,"" she said. ""It was unpleasant, and it ruined [my] day.""
A couple of weeks ago, she said someone dropped a bag of dog feces at her driveway. She wondered if what happened was merely
coincidental.
""Maybe to some people, it's hard to see those moments as racially charged aggressive moves,"" Wu said. ""It sucks that we even
have to think that we're overthinking. By definition, we shouldn't have to even have that frame of mind and ask if it's safe to be
outdoors.""
That fear is part of the reason Wu said she opted for remote learning for her three children. Wu said she and other Asian parents
are worried about COVID-19 exposures as well as their children being subject to discrimination.
""We feel scared that we are going to be blamed,"" said Wu, a Chinese American. ""This is why we keep our kids at home.""
Psychological effect
Researchers said experiences like microaggressions, harassment, experiences of threats or even anticipation of being mistreated
can lead to racial trauma.
""It's the sum total of our experiences of this kind of harm that has a psychological, compounding effect,"" said Doris Chang, an
associate professor at New York University.
Chang said the feelings of vulnerability and not being safe in one's environment create a psychological experience of anxiety,
which could trigger a hypervigilant response.
When Luk is out with her children, she said she is always scanning her environment.
""I constantly have to watch our backs,"" the mother of three said.
As Luk coached her children on math problems during remote learning last week, she wondered out loud what the future holds for
them.
""What kind of world will my kids grow up in?"" she said. ""They are innocent souls - unless something happens to them.""",8800
"For Jewish Asian-Americans, a new wave of hate arrives from two fronts","Cohen, H.",Others,2021-03-29,"NEW YORK – Jewish Asian-Americans have been left shaken by the latest wave of hate crimes against both of their heritages. The United States is in the midst of a shattering spike in hate crimes against Asian-Americans, with nearly 3,800 incidents of hate reported to the organization Stop AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) Hate in the past year. The reported violence and discrimination against Asian Americans increased by 1,900% since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which sparked a slew of offensive anti-Asian slogans, such as 'China Virus' and 'Kung Flu' because of its origins in the Wuhan province. The tragic shooting of eight people, including six Asian women, by a white man in Atlanta on March 16 brought new national attention to the gravity of this moment. As Jewish groups rally in support of Asian Americans following the string of murders, the crimes coincide with a surge of antisemitism during the pandemic, with Jews in some cases blamed by conspiracy theorists for the spread of disease. The waves of harassment against both minority groups have left Jewish Asians feeling especially vulnerable. Zoe Kress, a 27-year-old occupational therapy student who was born in China and adopted as an infant by a Jewish family in New Jersey, expressed 'grief, anger, sadness and hopelessness' that Asian American Jews like herself are facing unprecedented discrimination. Growing up attending Jewish day schools and summer camps, Kress said she’s always been vigilant about antisemitism, but before this year she didn’t worry much about Asian racism. 'We’ve sadly become accustomed to hearing about attacks on Jews. It’s scary that now I also have to be concerned about another part of my identity, too,' Kress told The Jerusalem Post. 'It’s something I never thought I’d have to worry about. But now it is and I think it actually worries me even more because I don’t look like a typical Jew, it’s harder to recognize. But I can always be identified as Asian,' she continued. 
YOSHI SILVERSTEIN, founder of Mitsui Collective, a Jewish nature and wellness organization, said the Atlanta massacre brought back painful memories of The Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh. 'The aftermath felt exactly the same for me. Both brought feelings of how personal it feels to have others attack a part of your identity. It felt vulnerable and visceral,' he recalled. 'Both brought isolation and loneliness.' Silverstein’s father is an Eastern European Jew and his mother is Chinese-American. He calls himself a 'Chinese-Ashkenazi American Jew.' Silverstein said that recent attacks on both of his identities have made him especially conscious to pass cultural traditions down to his three-year-old daughter. He does so by fusing the two heritages together, like cooking scallion latkes for Hanukkah. Last month, when the Lunar New Year fell on a Friday night, the family hosted a Chinese-themed Shabbat dinner. 'Despite the similarities between the two shootings,' Silverstein continued, 'it feels like there is a bigger gap following the Atlanta attacks, because it wasn’t something that impacted all Jews. It impacted Asian folks, and of course the overlap of Asian Jews. Early on, it was like: Are any non-Asian Jews paying attention? It brought me a different feeling of isolation.' But Silverstein, 37, also found comfort in the support he has received from the Jewish community since the Atlanta massacre. 'The day after, I saw other Asians, most of whom were not Jewish, expressing how they were feeling. That hit home for me. Then I was tagged in a solidarity post from a Black-Jewish liberation collective, which brought a lot of emotions for me. I needed that,' he recalled. 'A lot of folks from different Jewish corners have reached out to me, but I think I may be unique in that because I’ve worked in the Jewish world for a long time and have a lot of personal contacts.' Immediately following the Atlanta massage parlor murders, dozens of Jewish groups released statements condemning the rising levels of anti-Asian violence. Police in Georgia say the gunman may have been motivated by hatred of women and not anti-Asian bigotry, but regardless, the attack is likely to exacerbate the community’s anxiety.
'AS HATE crimes targeting Asian Americans continue to rise, this Jew won’t be silent,' said David Harris, CEO of the American Jewish Committee, on Twitter. 'As Asian Americans are attacked and, yes, killed, this Jew won’t be silent. As the larger fabric of our diverse society is threatened, this Jew won’t be silent.'The progressive Jewish group Bend the Arc issued a similar statement of solidarity. 'This is a national crisis fomented by politicians who have chosen to point fingers and spread fear instead of taking action to keep everyone safe from the pandemic,' the group said. 'Their words and rhetoric are once again echoing in gunshots, as they have in Pittsburgh, El Paso, and most recently in the halls of the Capitol building, and they must be held accountable. As Jews, we know that freedom and safety for any of us depends on the freedom and safety of all of us.''Institutions have put out brilliant statements that weave Torah with such acute understanding of the politics of the times,' said Rabbi Mira Rivera, a Filipino-American associate rabbi at Romemu, a popular Jewish Renewal congregation on Manhattan’s Upper West Side.The statements are not enough, Rivera told the Post. 'Did any of those people actually reach out and call somebody? How many congregations actually know their non-white Jews?'This is my face-to-face plea,' she continued. 'I hope and pray that Jewish organizations will actually try and spend more time and create relationships with Asian Jews. It has to take people dying, oftentimes, for Jewish professionals to reach out to non-Jews. It has to take an intersectionality of Jewishness for us to take a cause as ours. It puts tremendous pressure on us Asian Jews that the only time we’re reached out to is when people are dying. We’re remembered only when there’s a crisis that has disturbed the waters. If even after COVID, people are still wondering if we are all interconnected, I’m just really surprised.' Rivera said her pain is palpable. 'I’m shaking inside as I’m speaking. The women killed in Atlanta could be our sisters. I am tired of pulling out Torah to justify a response.' ",6373
'Tt's horrific'; Ga. slays cap tough year for Asian-Americans,"Oliveira, N. ",Others,2021-03-21,"Anasia Antonius used to take her time getting from her car to the Seattle church where she works as an office manager. The Indonesian mother would often stand leisurely outside the vehicle while grabbing her belongings and unbuckling her child from the car seat before dropping him off at the church-run day care.
But a series of disturbing anti-Asian incidents outside the church, which has been targeted by racist graffiti four times this year, has forced her to change her routine.
""To tell you the truth, I just run from the parking lot to the building now,"" she told the Daily News.
The minor change in Antonius' daily life is just one example of how Asian-Americans are shifting their behavior in light of a disturbing rise of anti-Asian harassment and violence across the country, with many of Asians staying away from public areas to avoid becoming targets..
The growing crisis made national headlines last week when a gunman stormed three Atlanta-area massage parlors on Tuesday and shot eight people to death, including six Asian women. Although authorities have not labeled the shooting spree a hate crime, Asian-American leaders say the rampage was the culmination of decades of discrimination against their community fueled by national figures who blamed the community for the coronavirus pandemic.
The racist rhetoric - frequently spouted by former President Donald Trump, who insisted on calling COVID-19 the ""Chinese virus"" or ""Kung Flu"" - helped stoke hate and embolden intolerance across the country, experts and advocates said.
""He was very deliberate in his choice of words to intentionally scapegoat and cast blame, and really hold Asian-Americans essentially responsible for the pandemic to distract from his own lack of responsibility and leadership,"" said Jennifer Sun, co-executive director at Asian Americans for Equality.
The racist language has had tragic consequences. Police statistics reveal that anti-Asian hate crimes went up by nearly 150% last year in 16 of America's largest cities, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, which studied law enforcement data.
A separate study by the group Stop AAPI Hate found that about 3,800 racially motivated attacks against Asian-Americans were reported nationwide since March 2020, with most of them targeting women. The report noted that the figure is ""just a fraction"" of the actual number since many victim don't report the attacks.
New York hasn't escaped the backlash. Just days ago, a man cursed and spat at an Asian woman who was walking her dog in lower Manhattan.
""You stupid c--k b--h! Go back 
to your country,"" he screamed, cops said. On Tuesday, another Asian woman in Midtown was doused with an unknown liquid by a racist attacker who snarled, ""Go back to China,"" police said.
The harm goes beyond the physical. Sun noted that many Asian women who lost their jobs, or were widowed during the pandemic are feeling ""very fearful"" about reentering the workforce because of the risk of being attacked during their commute.
""They're choosing not to go out, so they're much more isolated now as a result of this,"" Sun said. ""There's a fear about going out to buy groceries, running their everyday errands. Some of them are choosing not to get vaccinated because they're scared of going outside to vaccination sites.""
Antonius, who works at Seattle's International Full Gospel Fellowship Church, said some of the teachers at the day care there are Chinese women and most are ""terrified and scared"" by what's happening across the nation and outside their own workplace.
A mysterious bigot spelled out ""F-k China"" and ""You will pay"" in hay across the church parking lot. Officials have since hired a security staff and are in the process of installing a surveillance video system.
Joo Han, deputy director at the New York-based Asian American Federation, described Tuesday's shooting as the ""confirmation of the worst of our fears.""
""It's a year of trauma in the making. It's a year of grieving in the making. And I think it's going to take a long time for people to feel safe again,"" Han told The News.
""For a year, we've had so many verbal assaults and physical assaults, but to have it culminate in this senseless act of violence where six members of the Asian community had their lives taken for being at a place where they thought was safe, it's horrific,"" she said.
Melissa Borja, a professor at the University of Michigan's Asian/Pacific Islander American Studies program, has been documenting incidents of anti-Asian racism since last year, but is still gutted by the attack in Georgia.
""We all have a knot in our throats. It's nauseating and it's profoundly upsetting,"" she said. ""We're grieving not just the loss of life, but the loss of freedom that we felt we had and the sense of security that has been lost in this rise of anti-Asian hate.""
Studies show that most of the harassment against Asian-Americans happens in businesses and in the streets, with many victims being attacked while performing everyday tasks, like buying groceries or riding a bike.
Borja said many of her friends are telling their parents not go out alone as many of the attacks have taken place in public areas. Her own mother recently chose not to go for a walk after reading about a 74-year-old Filipino man who was attacked and killed at a Kentucky Fried Chicken parking lot in Arizona.
Antonius said the rise in anti-Asian racism during the pandemic has also taken a mental health toll, with many of her friends feeling depressed and unable to control their emotions. For now, though, Antonius is encouraged by the outpouring of support in her community and across the country.
""I feel better now,"" she said. ""Our church has been praying together, and we have a security guard patrolling our property as well.""

Asian American community on edge after deadly shooting in Atlanta,None,Others,2021-03-18,"Top of The World - our morning news roundup written by editors at The World. Subscribe here.
A white, 21-year-old man has been charged with killing eight people, including six Asian women, at several Atlanta-area massage parlors. The gunman faces eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault. Police continue to investigate the motive behind the shootings, but the bloody attacks happened against the backdrop of rising violence against Asian Americans across the US.
Georgia Sen. Dr. Michelle Au told The World that Asian American communities are on edge. “The bigger picture is that we've had a huge rise in violent acts, discriminatory acts, against Asian Americans. And in this milieu, having this incident happen in our communities really shakes people to their core and people are scared,” Au said.
The gunman told police that Tuesday’s murders were not racially motivated, but the statement is being received with skepticism given the locations and the fact that six of the eight victims were women of Asian descent.
Au said hate crimes against Asian Americans have been on the rise for the past year as the coronavirus pandemic hit the US but have been widely underreported. She wants to raise awareness of the magnitude of these types of hate crimes.
“What I would like to do just to start is to raise awareness of it regionally so that we can increase safety for our communities and make it so that people in the community feel safer reporting these incidents,” Au said. “I think that the incidents we have seen are a small fraction of the types of crimes and discriminatory behavior against Asian Americans that are taking place.”

Tanzania’s President John Magufuli, a prominent COVID-19 skeptic who has not been seen in public since the end of February, has died at the age of 61. Samia Suluhu Hassan, vice president of the East African nation, said in a statement on state television that Magufuli’s death was due to heart failure. But, his long absence from public life sparked rumors that he had contracted COVID-19. Vice President Hassan will assume the presidency for the remaining five years, becoming the first female head of state in Tanzania.
From The WorldA conversation with Bobi Wine, Ugandan opposition leader
Since 2018, the Ugandan government has been playing a game of catch and release with opposition leader and pop music star Bobi Wine, the stage name of Robert Kyagulanyi. The 39-year-old's latest detention - which lasted a matter of hours - happened on March 15, as Bobi Wine led a protest in Kampala. Bobi Wine, a member of the Ugandan Parliament, also leads the National Unity Platform, a political party deeply at odds with President Yoweri Museveni.
Bobi Wine told The World's Marco Werman that what keeps him going, despite the arrests, is his view that good always triumphs over evil.
""To know that love has always won [over] hate,"" he said. ""To know that nonviolence has always trumped violence. Knowing that an oppressed people cannot be oppressed forever, you know.""

Racist memes and posts about Asian-Americans online set the stage for real-world violence,"Davey, A. ",Others,2021-03-20,"In January, a new group popped up on the messaging app Telegram, named after an Asian slur.
Hundreds of people quickly joined. Many members soon began posting caricatures of Asians with exaggerated facial features, memes of Asian people eating dog meat and images of U.S. soldiers inflicting violence during the Vietnam War.
This week, after a gunman killed eight people — including six women of Asian descent — at massage parlors in and near Atlanta, the Telegram channel linked to a poll that asked, “Appalled by the recent attacks on Asians?” The top answer, with 84% of the vote, was that the violence was “justified retaliation for COVID.”
The Telegram group was a sign of how anti-Asian sentiment has flared up in corners of the internet, amplifying racist and xenophobic tropes just as attacks against Asian Americans have surged. On messaging apps like Telegram and on internet forums like 4chan, anti-Asian groups and discussion threads have been increasingly active since November, especially on far-right message boards such as The Donald, researchers said.
The activity follows a rise in anti-Asian misinformation last spring after the coronavirus, which first emerged in China, began spreading around the world. On Facebook and Twitter, people blamed the pandemic on China, with users posting hashtags such as #gobacktochina and #makethecommiechinesepay. Those hashtags spiked when former President Donald Trump last year called COVID-19 the “Chinese virus” and “Kung Flu.”
While some of the online activity tailed off before the November election, its reemergence has helped lay the groundwork for real-world actions, researchers said. The fatal shootings in Atlanta this week, which have led to an outcry over treatment of Asian Americans even as the suspect said he was trying to cure a “sexual addiction,” were preceded by a swell of racially motivated attacks against Asian Americans in places like New York and the San Francisco Bay Area, according to the advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate.
“Surges in anti-Asian rhetoric online means increased risk of real-world events targeting that group of people,” said Alex Goldenberg, an analyst at the Network Contagion Research Institute at Rutgers University, which tracks misinformation and extremism online.
Negative Asian American tropes have long existed online but began increasing last March as parts of the United States went into lockdown over the coronavirus. That month, politicians including Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., and Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., used the terms “Wuhan virus” and “Chinese coronavirus” to refer to COVID-19 in their tweets.
Those terms then began trending online, according to a study from the University of California, Berkeley. On the day Gosar posted his tweet, usage of the term “Chinese virus” jumped 650% on Twitter; a day later there was an 800% increase in their usage in conservative news articles, the study found.
Trump also posted eight times on Twitter last March about the “Chinese virus,” causing vitriolic reactions. In the replies section of one of his posts, a Trump supporter responded, “U caused the virus,” directing the comment to an Asian Twitter user who had cited U.S. death statistics for COVID-19. The Trump fan added a slur about Asian people.
Representatives for Trump, McCarthy and Gosar did not respond to requests for comment.
Misinformation linking the coronavirus to anti-Asian beliefs also rose last year. Since last March, there have been nearly 8 million mentions of anti-Asian speech online, much of it falsehoods, according to Zignal Labs, a media insights firm.
In one example, a Fox News article from April that went viral baselessly said that the coronavirus was created in a lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan and intentionally released. The article was liked and shared more than 1 million times on Facebook and retweeted 78,800 times on Twitter, according to data from Zignal and CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned tool for analyzing social media.
By the middle of last year, the misinformation had started subsiding as election-related commentary increased. The anti-Asian sentiment ended up migrating to platforms like 4chan and Telegram, researchers said.
But it still occasionally flared up, such as when Dr. Li-Meng Yan, a researcher from Hong Kong, made unproven assertions last fall that the coronavirus was a bioweapon engineered by China. In the United States, Yan became a right-wing media sensation. Her appearance on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show in September has racked up at least 8.8 million views online.
After the shootings in Atlanta, a doctored screenshot of what looked like a Facebook post from the suspect circulated on Facebook and Twitter this week. The post featured a miasma of conspiracies about China engaging in a COVID-19 cover-up and wild theories about how it was planning to “secure global domination for the 21st century.”
Facebook and Twitter eventually ruled that the screenshot was fake and blocked it. But by then, the post had been shared and liked hundreds of times on Twitter and more than 4,000 times on Facebook.

Vigil remembers Atlanta spa shooting victims Event at University of Central Florida denounces hate,"Chen, A.",Others,2021-03-24,"Asian Americans have been fighting two viruses during the pandemic: COVID-19 and hate.
That was the message Tuesday night at a vigil at the University of Central Florida honoring the eight victims, including six Asians, who were shot to death by a gunman last week at Atlanta-area spas.
""Hate is a virus. Hate can spread just as quickly as Covid-19 if we let it,"" said Mimi Chan of the Wah Lum Kung Fu and Tai Chi Temple in Orlando.
An estimated 150 to 200 people gathered at the event thatincluded a moment of silence, live music, prayer, speakers, a lantern ceremony and an open forum.
Together Chan urged that legislation condemning hate crimes against Asian Americans to be passed. Law enforcement agencies should also take an active role in hate crimes as well as hate incidents, which can be instances of harassment or verbal abuse, she said.
The livestreamed event brought together Asian Americans on campus and local community groups. Participants sat on the grass around the Reflection Pond facing Millican Hall.
""Hate in any form will not be tolerated on our UCF campuses, because our commitment to valuing excellence that comes from our differences is stronger than hate,"" said Dr. Edwanna Andrews of UCF Student Development and Enrollment Services.
Pastor Danny Chen, director of the campus InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, described Asian Americans as historically voiceless, politically powerless, and shown last week to be disposable.
He shared a painful family secret that his grandmother,who out of desperation as a single mother, worked in the sex indus
try at a massage parlor to put food on the table.
""I think we're so quick to attach some kind of social stigma against women in this industry,"" he said. ""It's much easier for us to see them as morally loose, as sexually promiscuous rather than to actually consider the reality that these are mothers and sisters and daughters who are gripped by the bondage of poverty and sexism and misogyny subjected to the exploitation of a broken humanity. We often forget that they too were created with dignity whose bodies reflected the very image of God.""
Imam Abdullah Saqib of the Islamic Center of Orlando and President of the Muslim student association at UCF said he stands with ""our brothers and sisters from the Asian community.""
""We also stand with anyone who is targeted, persecuted, abused, discriminated against or hurt because of their race, ethnicity or religion,"" he said.
""I say terrorism and violence has no religion,"" said Saqib. ""The only thing that could be associated with it is hatred and ignorance.""
Some of the students attending the event said they were shaken by the Atlanta spa shooting.
Janine Do, a third-year marketing major at UCF, she said her mom owns a nail salon in the Tampa area. Since the Atlanta homicides, she locks the door between customers. Her mother has also put a sign up at the store stating she is not Chinese, but Vietnamese.
""It didn't really hit me until now,"" said Do, tearing up.
Another student said since the pandemic started, she avoids going to the grocery store alone. The Atlanta shootings have made her feel frustrated, angry and numb.
""It's been a difficult ride,"" said Juli Meyer, a psychology major at Valencia College who identifies as Thai American.
""My hope for today is to be a supporter, and to be in a safe space, and be welcomed,"" she said, ""Hopefully this event will bring more awareness to hate crimes in the Asian community.""

Singaporeans in the US navigate racist stereotypes,"Ghosh, N.",Others,2021-03-27,"NEW YORK • Singaporean film-maker Eunice Lau, who lives in New York, remembers the morning she was walking back to her hotel from work on a film project in Minneapolis some years ago.
""I remember it was about 10.30am or 11am,"" she tells The Straits Times. ""So, broad daylight, downtown Minneapolis, walking from the federal courthouse to the hotel.
""And I got yelled at: 'Get out of my country, go back to where you came from!'
""The fact is that this harassment against Asians didn't just happen yesterday, just because of Covid-19,"" Ms Lau says. ""I think people need to account for that, put that into context.""
When it is useful or convenient, Asian Americans are the so-called ""model minority"", says Dr Jerrine Tan, a visiting lecturer in English at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts.
""Otherwise you're the yellow peril or you're the China virus,"" the Singaporean tells ST. ""Or you're the Fu Manchu, or you're the evil spy, or you're the dragon lady or the femme fatale.
""There are all these other stereotypes that are in fact used to describe Asian people in very pejorative terms that are conveniently forgotten about when the myth of model minority is used to make sure that you don't rock the boat, in fact.""
Separately, in an article in Wired, Dr Tan writes: ""After 14 years in the US, I have learnt to be vigilantly hyper aware of my skin. Racism most of the time rubs more like a rash than a gash.""
""I live in a conservative part of western Massachusetts. All through 2020, houses in the area brandished frightening and violent Trump paraphernalia,"" she adds.
""Before mask wearing became widely practised, I feared marking myself as 'foreign' by wearing one. Then I feared being 'exposed' as Asian when not wearing one. So I covered up completely.
""Under my hat, behind my sunglasses and mask, who could know who or what I was?""
As then United States President Donald Trump amped up his ""China virus"" rhetoric, Dr Tan and her husband decided to stop walking in the woods with their dog for fear of running into a ""gun-toting Trump supporter"".
""When we shared this decision with others, we always felt embarrassed, like we were overreacting,"" she writes.
After the March 16 Atlanta massacre, Asian social media sites were buzzing with alarm.
On a Facebook page called Singaporeans in Americas, resident Josephine Lee of Raleigh, North Carolina, muses about using a self-defence alarm she had obtained long ago in Singapore.
""Was heart-breaking... reading a 75-year-old Asian woman and an 83-year-old Asian man were attacked... near San Francisco's UN Plaza followed by six Asian women... killed in the Atlanta Spa shootings!"" she writes.
One user responds: ""These attacks are unprovoked and without warning.""
He adds: ""Got to be aware of your surroundings. It's sad.""
The stereotype of an Asian American - fuelled by the misleading ""model minority"" trope - is that he is a member of a community that keeps its head down and does not speak up.
""Now we're seeing them coming out in the thousands to stand up for their dignity and I think that's awesome to see,"" Ms Lau tells ST.
She adds: ""And that's what I feel - this is the moment, we've got to seize this moment to say, let's fight for our dignity, because if we don't fight, nothing's going to change.
""Nobody's going to give it to us on a silver plate. We've got to fight for it ourselves.""

Hate incidents toward Asian Americans seen during pandemic,"Mathew, B.",Others,2021-03-28,"GREEN BAY — When Pa Lee Moua heard about the tragic shooting spree in the Atlanta area last week, she quickly began texting and calling friends and family who work in the service industry at bars, retail stores and nail salons in the Fox Valley and her sister in Oshkosh to make sure they were OK.
While she saw news of the shootings unfold hundreds of miles away, she wanted to make sure friends and family were safe in their own communities.
Eight people, six of whom were Asian women, were killed March 16 in shootings at two spas and a massage business in the Atlanta area.
The victims were identified as Soon Chung Park, 74; Hyun Jung Grant, 51; Suncha Kim, 69; Yong Ae Yue, 63; Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Daoyou Feng, 44; and Xiaojie Tan, 49.
Moua, the diversity, equity, and inclusion officer for the Appleton Area School District, also sent emails to Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) staff in the district to check in with them and their students to make sure they knew they had an open space to process and grieve following the shootings.
""That's really a key pillar right now. We are hopeful that a lot of people are just checking in with each other,"" she said.
The shootings follow a wave of violence against Asian Americans in the country that jumped with the start of the pandemic, stirred by the racist and xenophobic language used by former President Donald Trump to tie the coronavirus to its origin in Wuhan, China.
Many Asian Americans in Wisconsin are still mourning the losses in Atlanta — and speaking out to make sure their voices and concerns about their safety are being heard.
Discrimination seen during pandemic in Wisconsin
Stop AAPI Hate, an advocacy group, reported nearly 3,800 incidents of harassment, discrimination and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from March 2020 to February 2021 nationwide, compared with around 100 incidents in previous years. Women reported hate incidents more than twice as often as men.
Advocates and residents around the country already had been speaking up about the rise in violence after reports of a series of attacks this year against Asian seniors and the killing of 84-year-old Vicha Ratanapakdee in San Francisco.
For Pam Her of Appleton, owner of 4Chi Business Solutions, the deaths drove home a fear she had been protecting her family and AAPI neighbors against since the early days of the pandemic.
Her, like many other Hmong residents in the region, had to find ways to protect herself as the number of reports of discrimination and violence grew during the pandemic. Her's family began traveling only during the day and keeping an eye on family members whenever they stepped outside.
""We did all our shopping, all the things that we need to do during the day and not go shopping at night – shopping in pairs, taking care of our families, our grandparents, our elderly parents, our elderly uncles and aunts, making sure they don't go to a store by themselves,"" Her said.
""If our grandparents or our mothers or fathers are going outside, even beyond our home, just to the garden next to our home, we watch them. We make sure that we are able to see them, that there's a window to protect them.""
Tara Yang has noticed differences in Green Bay, too. She saw a drop in customers at her family's store, Main Oriental Market, when the first cases arrived in the county in March.
Through summer months, business slowed down at their store, and some customers tried to avoid the store.
""We kind of understood and felt that people didn't want to come to the shop as much anymore just because of the fact that we're an Asian store,"" Yang said.
In April, the market's service vans were vandalized with a racist message related to COVID-19, Yang said.
But she noticed racism in other subtle ways, too, like when someone would go out of their way to avoid being around her when she was shopping at another grocery store or when she went to the bank to help her parents apply for a business loan.
The ""model minority myth,"" a stereotype that says all Asian Americans are successful and problem-free, has often hidden racism toward Asian Americans, Her said.
""As the model minority, we have been very invisible and ... even in spaces where we are the leader of those spaces, our voices a lot of times blend in with everything else. We really don't stand out,"" Her said. ""I think that with everything that is happening, the invisibility of the Asian community is coming to the surface now.""
When Her heard about the shootings in Atlanta, one of her biggest fears came true.
""We did not think about our Asian businesses and safety protocols for them because they are a sitting target,"" she said.
Many advocates, including Yang, said it shouldn't have needed to come to this crisis point in Atlanta because people around the country were sounding the alarm much earlier.
""It's sad that we had to wait until people died to take action. Since the start of the pandemic, we've been voicing, 'Hey someone just verbally attacked us. Someone tried to spit on us.' But people overlooked that. That's exactly why we're at where we're at right now, because those little crimes were overlooked,"" Yang said.
It raises a question Her has had to ask over and over: ""Why can't we be seen as Americans and be valued as Asian Americans? Why must we always be stereotyped as a foreigner?""
Sheng L. Riechers, a senior communications specialist for the city of Appleton, noted that there is a broad range of people who identify as Asian Americans, from countries in extremely diverse regions of east Asia, southeast Asia, and south Asia.
""As a Hmong American woman and as a Hmong Asian, I just wish that people took the time to learn more about Hmong people and our culture and our history and the reason why we're here in the U.S.,"" Riechers said. ""And just reminding them that the Hmong people, specifically, fought with U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War and that's why we're here. We're here as refugees of the Vietnam War.""
Addressing hate in the long term
Moua said local Hmong leaders have been working with Appleton and Fox Valley leaders to make sure people are checking in on Asian businesses in the area and communicating more with Hmong community leaders.
Green Bay Police Commander Kevin Warych said the police department will start holding community meetings with Asian American residents in Green Bay.
Warych said the police department hasn't received any reports of hate incidents in the city, but Yang noted she has heard about incidents that went unreported.
People rallied at ""Stop Asian hate"" marches and vigils held in Madison and Milwaukee as well as other states against racism, misogyny and xenophobia in the days after the shootings, seeking justice for the victims. Moua said the events are a way to vocalize the struggles so many Asian Americans face.
""Our culture and our community is a very silent community going back to trauma and keeping everything bottled in. We have to change that. We have to use our voice,"" she said.
But everyone can speak out on issues affecting Asian Americans and other marginalized groups, said Thai Xiong, the director of STEM and health and human performance at the Appleton school district and co-chair of N.E.W. Hmong Professionals.
""We are supporting each other because if other communities are willing to stand out with us, then we should be willing to stand up with them as well,"" he said.
Mai J. Lo Lee, diversity director at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay's Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs Office, noted people might make a social media post or correct a stranger's hateful or rude comment on the internet, but the hard part is holding conversations daily about hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
""I've been encouraging allies who identify as non-Asian to really reflect on the deficit that they themselves have as an individual and to be there for organization,"" Lee said.
One way to build support and understanding would be to ensure that young students are taught accurate histories of immigrants and other marginalized groups, Xiong said.
Lee suggested thinking about your excuses for lack of awareness. Take for example: ""Oh, I don't know about historical anti-Asian policies because my school never taught me,"" he said. Historical policies include, immigration quotas enacted in 1924 that barred many Asians from immigrating to the U.S.
""Let's look at your current school district,"" Lee said. ""Let's look at curriculum and say, 'Let's not repeat that mistake.' So how can I educate my child, my niece, my nephew, myself on that? You're recognizing, 'I'm holding myself accountable about not knowing about anti-hate history because my school never taught me.' Well then, hold your school accountable. Hold your colleges accountable. This is where alumni voice is very important.""
That same line of thinking can be applied to other parts of your life, Lee said. If you don't know know that many Asian American people in your workplace, question your workplace's hiring practices and policies. If you don't know have that many Asian American neighbors, ask yourself why that is? Is it that there are not many grocery stores and other businesses by and for Asian Americans in your community? How supportive is your community to minority-owned small businesses?
""Something I always challenge my friends and immediate family on: It's almost easier to correct a stranger, but how are you correcting family? How are you correcting colleagues? Your supervisor? The people you train? Because that's really where the work comes in, is that day-to-day,"" Lee said.

Hate Crime,"Foster-Frau, S., Liu, M., Knowles, H., & Kornfield, M.",Others,2021-03-26,"Asian Americans see shooting as a culmination of a year of racism
As Helen Kim Ho learned that a White man with a self-described sex addiction was charged with killing eight people - including six Asian women - at spas in the Atlanta area on Tuesday, she imagined the stereotypes of Asian women that must have run through his head.
Were not really Americans, were perpetually foreigners, and that idea plays out with women as being oversexualized, said Ho, a Korean American and a founder of the advocacy group Asian Americans Advancing Justice in Atlanta. All of that had to have played out in this mans own mind. In addition to the unspoken notion that Asian people are easy targets.
Atlanta police said the suspect told them his actions were not racially motivated - even though the shooter targeted businesses known for employing Asians, and six victims were Asian women. The suspect claimed he had a sex addiction, according to police, and wanted to eliminate temptation, which sounded to many women as if their sexuality was somehow to blame.
The gunmans intent seemed crystal clear to Asians living in Atlanta and across the nation who have long had to confront stereotyping, hateful harassment and even violence - and who say things have gotten even worse amid the coronavirus pandemic.
For Asian women, the moment felt particularly threatening.
As soon as Crystal Jin Kim heard about the shooting, she reached out to her mother and father, who immigrated to the United States from Korea. In a text, she urged them to be safe, to be careful, and to pray.
She thought about rescheduling one of their upcoming doctor appointments, and she worried about her mother going to work at a small business in the Atlanta area - she asked that the type of business not be named for fear of her mother being targeted.
Since I was a kid Ive heard racial slurs yelled at me or my parents, or witnessed my parents being treated as if they were stupid because their English isnt perfect, even though my moms English is really good, said Kim, a second-generation Korean American. Those small moments really add up. I dont think weve ever spoken up against those small moments. . . . Its easier to try not to think about it, or to try to let it go. To try to bury the hurt.
People have leaned out of cars to scream Asian! at her, she said, and she has gotten comments about how she must like Jackie Chan, the Hong Kong martial artist and actor. As an Asian woman, she said men often ascribe characteristics to her that dont reflect her personality - thats shes a pushover, or soft-spoken.
Really, Im not - Im very talkative and extroverted, Kim said. Its just people having these assumptions and treating me like a perfect Asian girl. Not even a woman, but a girl.
David Palumbio-Liu, a Stanford professor and author of Asian/American: Historical Crossings of a Racial Frontier, said there is a long history, extending well before the Vietnam War, of the fetishization of and murderous intent toward Asian women. He cited the Broadway musical Miss Saigon, which critics have said romanticizes an imperialistic relationship and portrays Asian women as acquiescent and self-sacrificing.
The suspect said it wasnt racially motivated, but on the other hand, hes going specifically to these spas where Asian women work precisely to serve the sexual fantasies of white males, Palumbio-Liu said in an interview, so to disentangle them is really to do a disservice to the fact that these things are so linked together.
The shooting made visible the worstcase scenarios many Asians living in the United States had feared. Many sadly expressed a similar sentiment: We knew this was coming.
The coalition Stop AAPI Hate has been documenting anti-Asian attacks since the pandemic started last March and says there have been nearly 3,800 hate-fueled incidents against the Asian American and Pacific Islander community in the U.S. - a number the group says is likely a fraction of the true number. About 3 in 10 Asian adults said theyve experienced jokes or slurs about their race or ethnicity during the pandemic, according to Pew Research - the highest percent among all races.
More than 68% of documented reports of anti-Asian harassment and violence since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic have been from women.
""I've never been this afraid to be Asian in America,"" said Dorothy Kuo, 38, who attempted to explain to her 6-year-old daughter what had happened in their community.
""I told her 'Mommy is having a hard time focusing today because last night there were eight people killed.' I just told her, honestly, what happened,"" said Kuo, who is Korean American, like several of the victims.
Kuo said she felt it was important to tell her daughter so she understands the world she's stepping into, one in which she might have to be more careful as an Asian woman.
""I've been refused seating at a restaurant,"" Kuo said, ""and even then I've never felt what I feel now.""
Jane Kim Coloseus, 32, grew angry Wednesday when Atlanta police declared it was too soon to say whether the slayings were racially motivated.
""As an Asian woman, it brings out a lot of the experiences or harassment we have received throughout our lives in general, and just have that completely invalidated because of what the suspect is saying,"" said Coloseus, a Korean American who is executive director of the nonprofit Her Term, which recruits women to run for office in Georgia.
She has long felt like she had to be more guarded - whether it's in the workplace or walking down the street - because of anti-Asian sentiments and the sexualization of Asian women's bodies. Asians have long been part of the fabric of the United States, she said, yet have ""been kept on the sidelines as the model minority,"" their voices ignored or muted.
""To me the equation is pretty straightforward,"" she said of the shooter's intent. ""It is racially motivated.""

"Elderly Asian woman pummels attacker in San Francisco, witnesses say","Dima, J.",Others,2021-03-17,"An elderly Asian woman is said to have pummeled a man and sent him to the hospital after he attacked her
without provocation in San Francisco on Wednesday.
The 79-year-old woman, who has not been publicly named, beat an unidentified man who attacked her until he
was bloodied, witnesses told KPIX 5. Video of the incident showed a crowd of people gathered around the
woman as she held an ice pack to a gash on her face and yelled in Chinese at the suspected attacker, who was
handcuffed to a stretcher.
“You bum, why did you bully me?” the woman yelled in Chinese.
“This bum, he bullied me,” she continued while facing the crowd. “He bullied me, this bum.""
The attacker, who was said to be 39 years old, was arrested after he assaulted an 83-year-old Asian male and
fled on foot, the San Francisco Police Department told the Washington Examiner in an email. He struck the 79-
year-old woman while fleeing a security guard who witnessed the first attack and was later detained, SFPD
added.
Both of the Asian victims were transported to a local hospital after the elderly woman told bystanders the man
punched her without provocation as she leaned against a light pole. The suspect, however, was ""transported to a
local hospital for an unrelated, prior medical condition,"" police said.
""Both assaults are believed to have been unprovoked,"" the department wrote. ""Investigators are working to
determine if bias was a motivating factor in the incident. This investigation is active and ongoing.""

WHITE HOUSE SAYS TRUMP'S COVID LANGUAGE ELEVATED THREAT TO ASIAN AMERICANS
The incident followed the apprehension of Robert Aaron Long, 21, who police said shot and killed eight people in
three Georgia Asian-owned spas on Tuesday.
Long's arrest reignited scrutiny from the U.S. public relating to Asian hate crimes, which have risen since the
onset of the coronavirus pandemic, because six of the eight victims who died appeared to be of Asian descent.
Law enforcement has not indicated that Tuesday's shooting was a hate crime, instead suggesting Long was
suffering from sex addiction and targeted the businesses to ""eliminate"" temptation.
President Biden also declined to name a motive for the shooting, saying he is making ""no connection at this
moment to the motivation of the killer.""
On Wednesday, San Francisco Mayor London Breed directed police in her city to “increase patrols in areas with a
high number of Asian residents, visitors, and businesses immediately.”
“No one should have to live in fear that their race or ethnicity could make them a victim,"" she added.

"It's open season: We're under siege as Trump, Republicans applaud racist provocation against Asian Americans",None,Others,2021-03-08,"""China virus.""
Those words were once again uttered by the twice-impeached, former president of the United States last weekend in Orlando and, as has become
the status quo, they were met with rambunctious applause from the Republican Party faithful.
For the better part of a year, the highest power in the land, the person with the largest microphone in the land, repeatedly used the phrases
""China Virus"" and ""Kung-Flu"" to describe COVID-19.
Let me tell you something, anybody who looks like me knows exactly what that means. What the intent of using those words actually is. Make no
mistake about it, it is 100% racism and for the people who say it, and the people who look past it, and the people who don't immediately
denounce it, and denounce it every time that is said, you are complicit actors in spreading the kind of racism that ultimately has escalated itself
into violence and murder.
I fear that the violence against Asian Americans will only get worse. I fear that people like me, who have a platform, who have the responsibility
and opportunity to speak out, could be the next victims of violence. It's a fear that I carry with me everywhere I go. Every knock at the door.
Every time I get out of the car to fill up my gas tank. Every time I run to the grocery store. It's a fear that will always be there as long as people
who are in power and who seek power see fit to use racism as their preferred instrument of war.
If the events of Jan. 6 should tell us anything, it's that members of the Cult of Trump take very literally the extreme and dangerous things said by
Donald Trump and his fellow arsonists of democracy. They aren't just empty words. They are directives. They are orders. And these white
nationalists are willing to act on them.
According to Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks attacks against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, there have been more than 3,000 reports of
racism and discrimination against Asian Americans in the past year. Two weeks ago, a man was caught on tape attacking an Asian American
woman in Flushing, Queens, a main hub for the Asian American community. An 84-year old Asian American was attacked while taking a walk
through his Bay Area neighborhood, and he died two days later. The rise in violence prompted the state of California to commit $1.4 million
toward helping Asian Americans report hate crimes.
The Biden administration released an executive order acknowledging ""the Federal Government must recognize that it has played a role in
furthering these xenophobic sentiments through the actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the
geographic location of its origin. Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific
Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI persons.""
It's a symbolic first step and a meaningful one after watching the highest officeholder in the land use the White House microphone to hurl racial
slurs against the AAPI community for a year. But the reality is we need more than just symbolic gestures and occasional mentions. Asian Americans are under siege.
Just last week, a 36-year-old Asian American man walking down the street in New York City was attacked and stabbed in the torso. A family in
Orange County is the target of habitual harassment, so much so that neighbors have taken to literally guarding the family's home. I was talking
to a college student the other day who shared with me the story of how she was walking downtown in San Francisco, and a man came up to her
and just spit on her. Just the other day, after appearing on MSNBC, I got a two-word message from a person that read, ""retard chinaman.""
The fact is Asian Americans are not safe in their homes. They aren't safe walking down the street. They aren't safe on the subway. They aren't
safe at restaurants. They aren't safe anywhere. It's 2021, and one of the two major political parties in America is applauding the provocation of
hate crimes against the AAPI community.
The Republican Party has declared open season on Asian Americans. Our blood is on their hands.

The incident, which is the latest in a spate of hate crimes, has also caused unease among some US-based Singaporeans.
Singaporean Pearly Tan, who lives in the US with her young family, has seen racism up close. She describes her encounters over the years and the steps she has taken to protect herself and her family.COMMENTARY, March 24 - On Sunday (March 21) evening, I put on a beanie, headphones and raincoat to go for a walk.
It was supposed to help me relax after a day of working from home. Instead, I was constantly afraid that I would be attacked from the side or behind, or approached from blind spots.
Downtown Berkeley, with its many university students, used to bustle with life before the Covid-19 pandemic.
Yet it was isolated and quiet.
I adjusted my walking route to avoid the few people who were out and seemed unstable. They were shouting mostly to themselves.
But I met one of them again on my way home and she was holding a stick.
I had forgotten to take along my pepper spray and stun gun.
It is at times like this when I do not know if making eye contact with a potential threat would trigger an attack.
I am part of a mixed-race family in the US.
My husband is Blackand we have two ""Blasian"" children (those with African and Asian heritage), aged five and two.
When I first saw news of the recent shootings at spas in Georgia, which killed six women of Asian descent, I chose not to read further.
I was in the middle of my work day and did not want to feel the emotions I knew would surface.
I have felt them each time a Black person or child has been wrongfully murdered in the US, and wondered how else I could protect my husband and children.
With the continuous spate of violence against minorities in the US, our family needs to be deliberate about when we open ourselves to the fear and anger that come with reading about others like us losing their lives.
For the first time, with the recent shootings, I saw a murder victim with the same last name as mine.
I am concerned that this recent shooting, which the gunman claimed was sexually motivated, would only be the start of more violence against Asians.
The larger problem that has been brought to the fore, however, is the sexualisation of Asian women by white men.
When I first moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2012, I was frequently the subject of catcalls.
In San Francisco, a guy said ""slanted eyes and juicy thighs"" as I walked by.
Today, that permission to harass Asians in public spaces has pivoted only slightly to include a veiled anger that has built up over the years, due toAmerican leaders' regurgitation of the ""model minority"" myth that encourages other minorities to see us as the ""other"".
Former president Donald Trump's repeated rhetoric that Covid-19 came from the Chinese did not help.
Everyday racism
I am very much aliveto the racism that pervades the US.
Last year, I was at a farmers' market in Berkeley, where I picked up a sealed box of cherries and put them down.
A white man began yelling at me, loud enough for everyone in the area to hear how I was ""disgusting"" (with an expletive thrown in) and the reason for the pandemic.
I walked away, but he and his partner followed me to another store. I eventually left.
At least 20 people witnessed the incident, but no one said or did anything.
After that, I did not go to the farmers' market for months.
I did not even want to go grocery shopping, so my husband had to do it.
Our family has experienced other threats of racial violence.
It is hard to describe the myriad of feelings that coursed through me the day my children and I were spotted by a racist white man who threatened our family.
As he shouted vulgarities from across the street, I made sure my children walked close beside me and away from his vitriol. It was the best I could do.
This was pre-pandemicand the area was crowded but, again, no one intervened.
When he was distracted for a moment, I grabbed my kids and weaved us into a crowd and then whisked them down a side street.
Since last year, I have also been acutely aware of how seniors in the Asian community here have been violently attacked as they went about their daily activities.
Waiting to cross a street should not be a scary affair.
I am extremely thankful that my parents are in Singapore and not living through this in the US.
To be sure, I have had positive encounters, too.
For example, in my workplace, several people have reached out to offer support. Safe spaces have been created for me to share my authentic feelings and concerns.
From town halls and virtual meetings to chat groups for Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, some of my colleagues and friends truly care and I will not waste time running after those who do not.
Self-defence
With the increased violence against Asians, the least I can do is continue as we have.
Because of the pandemic, we have mostly kept a safe distancefrom friends and family, which also means that we do not spend much time in public where others gather.
But when I must go out, I am more likely to carry a self-defence tool and much more likely to intervene if I see someone being attacked.
Short of owning a gun over concerns about misfires, especially with our young children, we have taken many precautions to reduce our risks - from taking self-defence classes to having a steel bat by the entrances to our home.
I have come to accept that this is life in America.- TODAY

Fractured politics is fuelling racial hatred in the United States: Attacks against Asian-Americans only the latest example of how partisanship at the highest levels of government can quickly spiral out of control,None,Others,2021-03-23,"A wave of hate crimes against Asian-Americans follows xenophobia over the Covid-19 pandemic and the anti-Chinese rhetoric of former US president Donald Trump and other conservative leaders. It came to a head last week with the shooting of eight people in Atlanta massage parlours, including six Asian women, although the perpetrator denies a racist motive. Now a 76-year-old Chinese woman who fought back against a white assailant has done more to inspire public empathy with the plight of her community than official expressions of concern and support from as high as the White House.
Grandmother Xie Xiaozhen was standing at an intersection in San Francisco when a 39-year-old man ran up and hit her in the face. She picked up a wooden plank lying on the ground nearby and hit him in the face. A video clip of Xie, originally from Guangdong, looking shaken and crying out in Cantonese ""Why did you hit me?"" went viral as it was picked up by international and Chinese media. It showed Xie holding an ice bag to her bruised face while her assailant was put on a stretcher with blood dripping from his mouth.
The assault is an example of an outbreak of random attacks on older Asian-Americans in particular, leading to demonstrations in a number of cities after the shooting spree in Atlanta. Community activists attribute the discrimination and violence to political rhetoric about the pandemic because the epicentre of the initial outbreak was Wuhan, China.
President Joe Biden visited Atlanta to offer solace to Asian-Americans. He denounced the scourge of racism at times hidden ""in plain sight"" and called for a halt to related violence. The authorities have come under scrutiny after a sheriff's official said the suspect had had a bad day before the shooting and was ""at the end of his rope"", reflecting criticism that white offenders are often afforded empathy.
Biden may be saying the right things, but they should be directed mainly at supporters of the man he defeated in the last election, Trump. So far they have not been listening. Trump may not be in charge now, but it takes people like him to call out militant racist sentiment among his loyal following. In the case of resistance among his followers to Covid-19 vaccinations, Trump, to his credit, has urged them to have it, though Dr Anthony Fauci, his former medical adviser and now Biden's, has appealed to him to do more in this regard.
So long as race relations remain a visceral issue for many Trump voters among Republicans, and he mulls a political comeback, it is hard to imagine he can be persuaded to call out race hate unequivocally. Without a bipartisan consensus, it is to be hoped the forces of law and order are prepared to deal with the consequences without further inflaming feelings of prejudice and injustice.",2796
"Asian community leaders in Western Pennsylvania are reeling with emotion and striving to quell fears days after a gunman stormed three Asian-run spas in the Atlanta area, killing eight people [Derived Headline]","Lindstrom, N. ",Others,2021-03-18,"Asian community leaders in Western Pennsylvania are reeling with emotion and striving to quell fears days after a gunman stormed three Asian-run spas in the Atlanta area, killing eight people.
""We're anxious, we're heartbroken, we're raging,"" said Marian Lien, president of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Organization for Chinese Americans. ""We're still in disbelief.""
Tuesday's deadly attacks -- which were not described by police as racially motivated but claimed the lives of six Asian women -- were especially upsetting to Lien and other advocates who had been warning of a surge in anti-Asian hate for months.
Two weeks ago, a national report found at least a 150% spike in reported hate crimes against Asians in the past year, for more than 3,800 incidents since last March. The AAPI Stop Hate tracker found that Asian women were targets of hate incidents 2.3 times more than Asian men.
More than 40 organizations from the Pittsburgh region -- faith-based groups, labor unions, nonprofits, Black and Latino groups and others -- signed a March 3 letter condemning anti-Asian violence, asserting the problem is ""part of the same inequitable system that affects Black, Indigneous and Latino American communities.""
""We're angry beyond belief that it took the lives of at least six of our community (of Asian descent) and another two in the greater community to bring awareness to something that we've been trying to say has been going on for over a year,"" Lien said. ""We're tired of having to prove that these things are happening.""
Pittsburgh law enforcement officials say they have not observed a recent uptick in incidents targeting Asians.
""Police have not informed of us any specific incidents, increased attacks or threats against the Asian community in Pittsburgh,"" Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Cara Cruz said by email Thursday. ""The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police takes threats of violence, ethnic intimidation or hate crimes against any minority group extremely seriously and strongly encourages anyone who experiences this or witnesses suspicious behavior to report it to police immediately.""
But oftentimes incidents go unreported or don't get tracked, with reporting among individual police departments spotty and voluntary.
The FBI estimates at least two-thirds of all hate crimes don't make it into their databases.
Lien said other times incidents may not involve violence or reportable crimes but still signal worrisome trends.
Among examples: She's been told to ""go back to China with the virus"" while shopping for groceries. A vandal scrawled ""Nuke China!"" on a sign in Squirrel Hill. On Thursday, she accidentally bumped into a man while walking in Pittsburgh's Oakland neighborhood, and the man fired off a racial slur.
""We may not have deaths or homicides on our hands yet, but I can tell you that there have been within the community reports of those who've been physically attacked,"" Lien said. ""The types of racism that we faced prior to the pandemic were more subtle. It's an intensity now that is scary.""
Signs of solidarity
Efforts are in the works to demonstrate support for the region's Asian community.
On Saturday afternoon, a ""Stop Asian Hate"" rally is planned at the intersection of Forbes and Oakland avenues, promoted by the region's social justice advocates and organized by a group called Thrash the State.
In the city's Squirrel Hill neighborhood -- where 17% to 20% of residents are Asian, compared to closer to 6% of the population in the greater metro area -- the Jewish Community Center for Loving Kindness has been prepping anti-hate and love-your-neighbor signs of solidarity to hang in the windows of Asian-run businesses.
""In this last year, we have seen our neighbors and community members face increasing amounts of anti-Asian hate crimes and we will not allow hate in our community,"" the center's leaders said in a statement. ""While we may not be able to offer direct aid to the victims and their families, we can offer support to our Asian neighbors, who, as a group, have been experiencing growing anti-Asian bigotry and violence in the past several months.
""We can show our support in many ways such as shopping at Asian-owned businesses and reaching out to our neighbors and friends who may be frightened and traumatized to listen to them and comfort them.""
Rabbi Hazzan Jeffrey Myers of the Tree of Life synagogue -- whose congregation was among those attacked by a gunman who killed 11 people on Oct. 27, 2018 -- issued a statement in support of his Asian and Asian American neighbors.
""We know the pain and stinging loss produced by hate-fueled violence, and offer our friendship and support in this terrible moment,"" Myers said. ""We are firm in our resolve and commitment to building bridges of understanding so that we may work together to end all forms of racism, xenophobia and bigotry.""
Earlier this week, Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh announced partnering on a project to track online hate via the newly formed Collaboratory Against Hate Research and Action Center.
""Our Asian and Asian American communities are vital threads of the Pitt fabric, contributing greatly to our enrichening, multicultural experience and excellence,"" said Clyde Pickett, Pitt's vice chancellor for equity, diversity and inclusion. ""Our racial diversity is our strength, and it is crucial that everyone feel safe and supported here at Pitt.""
Lu-in Wang, vice provost for faculty affairs and a Pitt law professor who researches discrimination, said that when analyzing the data and individual incidents, ""It's important to understand that bias crimes are not always driven by a single, 'pure' motive like hate.""
""They are often crimes of opportunism,"" Wang said. ""That is, what motivates a perpetrator is the very thing that makes these crimes so frightening and harmful: the idea that the members of particular social groups are suitable or acceptable targets for violence and harassment.""
Lien said one of the subtler forms of discrimination involves being treated like the ""forever foreigner,"" no matter how many decades or generations people of Asian descent have lived in the region.
Advocates had started sounding the alarms of a surge of negativity toward Asian Americans at the start of the covid-19 pandemic. Prior to the statewide lockdown, some Asian-run restaurants reported suddenly losing as much as 40% to 50% of their business because of misplaced notions that Asian businesses posed a higher risk of the novel coronavirus.
Reports of anti-Asian discrimination to civil agencies have continued to climb in the region and statewide since the arrival of covid-19 last March.
Just last week, days before the attack in Atlanta, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission held a town hall on anti-Asian discrimination that involved policymakers, state police, community representatives and researchers who already expressed mounting concerns over escalating xenophobia.
""As state and national reports of discrimination, hate crimes, racial slurs and bias against the (Asian American Pacific Islander) community are rising exponentially, the PHRC has become increasingly concerned and alarmed for Pennsylvania's residents,"" said Chad Dion Lassiter, the state commission's executive director. ""We are taking this disturbing trend very seriously and have been actively meeting with colleagues, leaders and representatives of the AAPI community to address this issue head-on.""

Indian American hotel owners shot in Maryland over dispute,None,Others,2021-03-18,"New York, March 18 -- Indian Americanhotel owners were shot during an argument with a guest at their New Eastern Inn in Elkton, Maryland last week.
Usha and Dilip Patel, both 59, were shot in the lobby following an argument with a guest, possibly over payment, reports said.
Originally fromBharthana, Uttar Pradesh in India, Usha died and Dilip was wounded following the tragic incident, the Police said.
The guest Hakeem Evans, 26, of Newark, Delaware, had been staying at the hotel for a couple of days, said Lt. Lawrence Waldridge with the Elkton Police Department.
According to reports, it is the latest example in a trend of violence toward hotel owners and Asian Americans.
The incident was caught on surveillance video.
At one point, police say, Evans put a gun between a plexiglass partition separating him from thePatelsand fired. Usha was shot in the chest and Dilip was shot in the hip before the gun apparently jammed.
""Evans is then seen running back to his rented room and moments later, flees the area in a vehicle, which was occupied by another person who is not identified at this time,"" according to a EPD press release.
""Elkton police arrested Evans a few hours later without incident at the Royal Farms Convenience store.""
Evans has been charged with first degree murder, first degree assault, attempted murder and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, according to EPD. He is being held in the Cecil County Detention Center without bond.
Dilip was taken to Christiana Hospital after the shooting where he remains in stable condition, according to the EPD.
Both attacks represent an ongoing problem, said Cecil Staton, Asian American Hotel Owners Association (AAHOA) president and CEO, in a statement on the most recent shooting.
""America's hotel owners are shocked and outraged by this senseless act of violence against two small business owners doing their jobs,"" Staton said. ""Attacks against hoteliers continue to increase, and this is yet another horrendous episode of violence against Asian Americans that is plaguing our society. It must stop now.""
Staton said the violence is directly connected to the Covid-19 pandemic.
""The past year placed undue anxiety, pain, and uncertainty on our nation, yet hoteliers continue to welcome guests into their hotels and their communities,"" he said.
""This crime compounds the anxieties hotel owners face. Every hotelier knows that something like this could happen to them at any time. Service to others defines the spirit of hospitality, and that is what makes a loss such as this so tragic.""

Anti-Asian hate crimes have risen 150% nationwide: Study ,"Soellner, M.",Others,2021-03-09,"A new study revealed hate crimes against Asian Americans spiked almost 150% throughout 2020, a year ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic that is speculated to have fueled some of the violence after the virus was first discovered in China. 
An analysis released by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, looked into hate crimes in 16 of the country's biggest cities and how they compared from 2019 to 2020. 
OLIVIA MUNN SPEAKS OUT AGAINST VIOLENCE TOWARD ASIAN AMERICANS: OUR COMMUNITY IS 'NOT SAFE' 
In New York City, the study found crimes targeting Asian Americans went up 833%. Around 14.5% of the city is part of the Asian American community. Philadelphia and Cleveland both went up 200%, while Los Angeles went up by 114%. 
The first spike in anti-Asian hate crimes started in March and April of last year, when the pandemic began to send the country into lockdown. In March, the FBI warned of an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans in light of COVID-19. 
""The FBI assesses hate crime incidents against Asian Americans likely will surge across the United States, due to the spread of coronavirus disease … endangering Asian American communities,"" an FBI intelligence report said, according to ABC News. 
""The FBI makes this assessment based on the assumption that a portion of the U.S. public will associate COVID-19 with China and Asian American populations,” it continued. 
In recent weeks, a number of crimes targeting older Asian Americans have shed light on the issue, prompting local officials to ramp up their calls to report racist incidents. 
New York City launched the Asian Hate Crime Task Force to focus on the entire city with a special eye on the transit system after a number of incidents occurred on the subway.

""Every community suffered, but there's been a particular pain, a particular horrible challenge, faced by the Asian American community,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said. ""Because on top of all the suffering from the coronavirus itself, on top of losing loved ones losing businesses, people have had to confront horrible discrimination and hatred."" 
The coronavirus pandemic has infected more than 29 million people in the United States, with over 525,000 deaths attributed to the virus.

Cheyenne teen speaks out against anti-Asian stigma amid COVID-19,Wyoming Tribune-Eagle,Others,2021-03-21,"Pervasive racist rhetoric about the COVID-19 virus, which was first detected in China, has fueled a rise in anti-Asian sentiment and violence over the past year. And at least one Korean-American student at Cheyenne's East High School has endured bullying as a result. 
But one of his classmates, YuYu Yuan, is a champion orator who is using her voice to raise awareness about the harmful consequences of blaming ethnic or minority groups for the spread of diseases.
CHEYENNE – Davin Ro has made hundreds of unmemorable passes through the hallways of Cheyenne’s East High School.
But, Ro, a sophomore and second-generation Korean-American, hasn’t forgotten what happened on a walk to class last fall as COVID-19 cases surged in Laramie County.
He heard a group of students loudly “expressing their hate for all Asians for bringing the virus to ’their proud America.’” The comment upset Ro, who is part of the 1% of East students who identify as Asian, but he wanted to avoid “escalating the problem,” and ignored them.
Then, the students’ comments got more targeted.
“They looked at me and tried to point the blame at me,” he recalled in an interview with the Wyoming Tribune Eagle last week. “They told me to go back to my country and take my virus with me. (They said) I’m not wanted here because I killed and infected so many people.”
Ro, who was born in the United States, said being blamed for a pandemic he has no control over was at once baffling and hurtful. He did the political calculus, however, and decided “to brush it off.” It wasn’t worth it to report the bullies, he said, fearing possible backlash.
From Ro’s point of view, what happened last fall is one example of how Laramie County School District 1 “hasn’t changed at all” since the McCormick Junior High School episode of 2019, in which a student posted homophobic and racist fliers on campus. A subsequent investigation showed it wasn’t an isolated incident within the school, and likely the district, and that staff both inadequately responded to or aided in the bullying.
Since then, LCSD1 has publicized its efforts to correct this disturbing school culture.
But at least one student isn’t waiting on new policies to combat pervasive racist stigmas – like the kind that played a role in the bullying of Ro last fall, the massacre of Asian women near Atlanta, Georgia, last week, and the dramatic uptick in violence against Asian-Americans over the past year.
YuYu Yuan is an award-winning orator who helped East High School’s speech and debate team clench its fourth state championship in as many years last weekend. All year, she’s been delivering – and perfecting – a powerful speech titled ”Are you sick of me yet?”
{iframe title=”YouTube video player” src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/6t7I9iL7nNM” frameborder=”0” width=”560” height=”315”}{/iframe}
Her speech runs through the long history of scapegoating ethnic and minority groups for the spread of diseases, and explores how that rhetoric has led to widespread xenophobic reactions to the COVID-19 virus, which was first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.
For more than a year now, Yuan has listened to powerful people – including former President Donald Trump and Wyoming state Sen. Jim Anderson, R-Casper – publicly challenge the seriousness of the virus, some suggesting it’s part of a nefarious Chinese plot. She also started hearing more and more people use derogatory terms like “Kung Flu” and “Chinese Virus” to describe COVID-19, which has killed more than 541,000 Americans as of Saturday.
“I was really scared”
“Yes, this has fueled anti-Asian sentiment, but this isn’t new. People have used diseases before as a way to target minority groups,” said Yuan, who moved with her family from southeast China to the U.S. at the age of 4. She wrote her speech, which has already won five awards this school year, about disease stigma to raise awareness about the consequences of prejudiced thinking.
“I think it’s something everyone should know about, so that we’re more conscious of our actions, our words and how we’re phrasing things,” Yuan said. “What I wanted to translate to people is that this is a real thing that affects people everywhere, even though there might not be a lot of blatant anti-Asian sentiment in Cheyenne.”
Yuan said she feels “lucky” to have been spared the bullying Ro experienced through the pandemic, but it was never a given.
When Wyoming reported its first COVID-19 cases around this time last year, Yuan said she wasn’t too concerned, and was excited about getting a few extra days off from school.
But it soon became clear that neither the virus, nor the anti-Asian rhetoric it unleashed, were going anywhere.
And that’s when the fear set in.
A routine trip to Walmart – where she was one of the few wearing a face mask at the start of the pandemic – suddenly felt intense.
“I noticed people staring, and it felt very uncomfortable to be in that situation,” Yuan said. “In that moment, I was just scared that someone was going to say something racist or do something to me. That’s what I was really scared of when the pandemic first hit Cheyenne.”
Yuan, who plans to pursue a career in politics or advocacy, has participated in speech and debate since freshman year. Now a senior, speech and debate gave her an outlet to process her trepidation about anti-Asian violence and rhetoric this year.
Educating new generations
A standard history class in Wyoming doesn’t require teachers and students to discuss the context of heavy current events like the rise of anti-Asian sentiment. But for students who participate in speech and debate, no topic is off limits.
“One of the most important aspects of speech and debate is that it stretches our imaginations so that we can see that the way things are is not the way things have to be,” said Marcus Viney, East’s head speech and debate coach. “The hope is to encourage a more thoughtful and compassionate world.”
Educating more Wyomingites about the state’s history of anti-Asian violence and discrimination – which includes the Rock Springs Massacre of 1885 and the presence of the World War II-era Heart Mountain Japanese internment camp – is key to making life here more inclusive for everyone, said Aura Newlin, an assistant professor of sociology and anthropology at Northwest College in Powell.
“Most of my students are from Wyoming or Montana, and I’ve noticed there’s a split in what they know about this history,” she said. Newlin is a fourth-generation Wyomingite and fourth-generation Japanese American whose great-grandparents were imprisoned at Heart Mountain in the 1940s. Newlin, who recounted two relatively recent xenophobic encounters in an opinion column published in the Casper Star-Tribune last week, characterized the bigoted sentiments in reaction to COVID-19 as “disappointing and horrifying,” but not surprising.
She said she hopes places like the Heart Mountain Interpretive Center, which is set to open an exhibit on disease stigma next month, and a stronger emphasis on Asian American history in the classroom will slowly help to change that reality.
“The current generation of politicians wouldn’t have learned about any of this in school,” Newlin said. “It’s not an excuse for using racialized language or being ignorant today, but it gives me hope that future generations of leaders in Wyoming will have attended schools” that did talk about it.
”We haven’t learned from the past”
For now, students like Yuan, who is waiting on application decisions from Harvard and Stanford, are forging a path for change in Wyoming and beyond.
She’ll deliver her speech at the national speech and debate tournament later this year. “Diseases can kills us, but fear is what will end us,” reads one of the most poignant lines.
And after the murders of six Asian women in Atlanta last week, that message has become even more – if not painfully so – relevant.
“It makes me sick to my stomach,” Yuan said. “This has happened before, and it makes me upset that we haven’t learned from the past.”

'Waiting for this moment': Rally for Asian Americans in Fort Lee draws over 700,"Koloff, A. ",Others,2021-03-28,"FORT LEE — A rally on Saturday that drew more than 700 people was part of ""an awakening of activism"" among Asian Americans, one of its organizers said, sparked by a recent mass shooting in Atlanta that came amid a rise in hate crimes over the past year.
People packed into a borough park as organizers and community leaders spoke out against hate crimes that have targeted Asian Americans and read aloud the names of the people who were recently shot and killed in Atlanta. It was one of several rallies across North Jersey, including recent events in Leonia, Teaneck and Tenafly; and among many that were scheduled to be held across the country over the weekend.
The rally organizers, who were mostly young people, said they believe the rallies were a first step for an Asian community that has not often engaged in this kind of demonstration.
""I never saw activists who look like me,"" said Gabriella Son, 20, a rally organizer. ""We've been waiting for this moment. I don't think there's ever been a moment when Asian Americans had a movement.""
Son said she was inspired by an Asian American literature course that she has been taking in college, and by reading about Asian culture in the U.S. Many people, she said, view Asian Americans, even those born in the U.S., as foreigners — and have blamed them for the COVID-19 virus because it is believed to have begun in China.
""I've never been to Asia,"" she said.
One of the signs held up at the rally said racism is a virus.
Son and others at the rally said the Georgia shootings highlighted concerns about the sexualization of Asian women — six of whom were among the eight people killed when a gunman targeted several spas in the Atlanta area. Several people said former President Donald Trump tapped into stereotypes when he referred to COVID-19 as ""kung flu,"" among other things, even in the face of reports of Asian Americans being harassed.
Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, who was among the speakers at the rally, said police counted at least 750 people at the borough's Hudson Lights park. He urged people to report hate crimes to borough police and shouted out his cellphone number so that such crimes could be reported directly to him.
""You are police officers, our Planning Board, you are our council members,"" he said to Asian Americans in the crowd. ""You are the fabric of our community.""
He noted that Asian Americans make up a large part of the Fort Lee community — 42%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau — and said he was pleased Saturday's event was attended by a diverse crowd, with many non-Asians in the audience.
Michael Totera, 22, of River Edge said he attended because he wanted to support his Asian friends. ""I don't feel right sitting back and doing nothing,"" he said.
Organizers said they hope to make a permanent change when it comes to awareness of anti-Asian racism in America — in the same way that Black Lives Matter protests last summer sparked by the death of George Floyd changed the conversation about the way Black people are treated in America.
""We're trying to bring more awareness,"" said Sharon Kim, 15, a 10th-grade student at Fort Lee High School. ""We need to learn more about Asian history. There haven't been a lot of marches for Asians.""
There were protests decades ago, after a Chinese American man named Vincent Chin was killed in Detroit in 1982 by two men who thought he was of Japanese descent at a time when some people blamed Japanese car manufacturers for the decline of the American auto industry. The men initially got off with a fine, although one was found guilty in a federal civil rights trial. The conviction was later reversed.
This year, as hate crimes against Asian Americans have grown during the pandemic, an Anti-Defamation League survey found that 17% of Asian Americans said they had been harassed online, an increase of more than 50% from last year.
Bergen County Executive James Tedesco, who spoke during Saturday's rally, reminded the crowd that a Chinese restaurant in Wyckoff had been vandalized last June when someone spray-painted ""Covid-19"" on the windows. He told the crowd that ""our county's diversity is its greatest strength.""
Son, a rally organizer, said people across the nation have ""become more racially conscious"" over the past year and that Asian Americans are feeling threatened as perhaps never before. She said her parents, who came from South Korea when they were school children, don't remember such a large number of assaults being reported.
""We can no longer be silent,"" Son said. ""This is a direct attack on our people.""

Activist hit for race rant a rally backer,"Shahrigian, S. ",Others,2021-03-23,"A Brooklyn man who was taken off his local community board after he made a hateful anti-Asian rant is listed as a supporter of an upcoming rally for solidarity with Asian-Americans.
Assemblywoman Mathylde Frontus (D-Brooklyn) recently announced the event ""in partnership"" with locals including Ronald X. Stewart, whom the Daily News exposed for an anti-Asian Facebook tirade in March 2020 - around the same time the city began to see an increase in hate crimes amid the onset of coronavirus.
""These Chinese restaurants in our community make millions of dollars off us,"" he raved. ""They don't hire us; don't donate to any of our events and express racism against us.
""Yes I said all this now attack me!"" he taunted.
He was defending a Frontus staffer who had made xenophobic comments about the COVID outbreak, saying the assemblywoman shouldn't have to apologize for that staffer's conduct. Frontus later fired that staffer.
Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams declined to reappoint Stewart to Community Board 13 after the anti-Asian tirade surfaced. Stewart could not be reached for comment.
Frontus announced the ""stop AAPI hate"" rally, set for Thursday at the Wall of Remembrance at MCU Park in Coney Island, as the city reels from an ongoing spike in anti-Asian hate crimes. AAPI stands for Asian-American and Pacific Islander.
She defended her decision to include her longtime supporter Stewart among the list of partners for the event.
""I don't want to relive what happened in the past,"" Frontus told The News on Monday morning. ""He was wrong and he apologized for it. I'm not sure if there's something else that you want me to say.""
Later Monday, she said in an email that Stewart would not attend the rally, but was still ""listed [as] a supporter of the rally just like dozens of other community members.""
Stephanie Wong, president of the United Chinese Association of Brooklyn, slammed Frontus' decision to include Stewart in the upcoming rally. Wong said in spite of her requests to Frontus, she's never received evidence that Stewart apologized for his hateful statement. ""I don't think he has any legitimacy to do this before he sends an apology to our community publicly,"" Wong said.",2197
Asian Americans must support each other: OP-ED,"Abueva, J. E.",Others,2021-03-23,"I call it Asian Target Anxiety Syndrome — ATAS for short. It’s real and it’s rampant. The worry that, as an Asian person, you will be targeted for verbal or other attacks, makes one rethink daily routines. Even watching what to say and how to act in public as not to draw attention. It’s a new reason to stay at home. And I admit to experiencing acute symptoms.
What has been a spate of reported attacks on Asian Americans in recent months, from incidents of verbal harassment to injury and murder, has emerged as a full-blown crisis. While the origins of such bigotry may be tied to seeking a scapegoat for the pandemic in a highly charged xenophobic hothouse nationwide, America is now at a precipice, just as we were a year ago when COVID-19 cases skyrocketed. The chatter alone is my sign that ATAS cases are exploding exponentially. Last week’s horrific gunning down of eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at spas in the Atlanta area send a collective chill of fear and helplessness down the spine of Asian American communities.
Groups like Stop AAPI Hate have vehemently denounced the violence, as have allies from several quarters. President Joe Biden, in his speech March 11 on the one-year anniversary of the shutdown, condemned hate and discrimination targeted at Asian Americans, wherein reported hate crimes had been rising before the Atlanta shootings. Rallying in and around the community through awareness and education is an appropriate response. But Asian Americans also need to focus on admitting openly that we are scared and suffering, and to seek urgent care for ourselves as a truly united Pan-Asian front. That means emotional support and deep caring for one another regardless of socioeconomic status or country of origin.
This may not come as easily as one might think. In a white-dominated society, Asian Americans have long had to live up to its model minority myth (stereotype) of achieving socioeconomic success fueled by “good at math” academic achievement. But that narrative also erases our diversity and our working-class communities. It’s not just blood, sweat, and tears that have driven us, but the false promise of assimilation as well — trying to blend in, as not to be the nail that gets hammered down. This double-edged sword translates into an alienating pressure to be nonconfrontational, hiding our emotions even when we are at the receiving end of prejudice or bias. And hate crimes remind us that we never truly “blend in.”
The activism of a younger generation speaking out gives me hope. Even after 30 years, I myself cannot shake off — and for the first time am publicly sharing the sting of — being called a “gook” as I walked through the Staten Island Terminal. I realize many others have faced much worse, but a microaggression is still just that, an aggression.
Asian Americans are the fastest-growing racial and ethnic group in the U.S. There are over 20 million of us, comprised of over 20 distinct ancestries from across East, Southeast, and South Asia. We are oftentimes clustered into one monolithic entity, our diversity blunted. But we need to embrace that diversity, and reject the prejudices within our communities.
Having grown up across Asia, I witnessed firsthand the pejorative attitudes Asian peoples can have toward another, depending on where they come from, ethnic minority status within their country, and class. No one is immune. These stem from a long history of conflict and culture clashes that have travelled over the Pacific Ocean, or taken unique forms in the U.S. As a Filipino American, I have been guilty of expressing relief whenever an Asian who has committed a crime is identified as anyone but, so I don’t have to worry about more stereotypes attaching to Filipinos specifically.
But leaning into our internal divisions is not the path forward. A few weeks back, a colleague brought together Asian American marketing professionals from various sectors in an open forum to hear from one another. In this diverse group, some participants were in tears, overwhelmed by their own visibility among others who inherently understand the challenges they face. We need more such forums now and often.
This time, more than ever, calls for us all to set aside our differences and come together in open dialogue — to speak out against racist hate, and also to soothe our shared pain, to protect one another.

Fears of racist violence grow for state's Asian Americans,"Smith, K., & CHHITH, A.",Others,2021-03-18,"Tuesday's deadly shootings in the Atlanta area, where a white gunman killed eight people -- six of them women of Asian descent -- have heightened concerns across Minnesota about the increase in violence against Asian Americans, especially women, since the start of the pandemic.
In Austin, Minn., an Asian American family found the words ""China virus"" burned into their lawn. In Bloomington, a woman walking on a trail was attacked after racial slurs were hurled at her.
And in Shakopee, a couple were followed out of a store by a man who shoved the husband and yelled that they should ""take the coronavirus and leave.""
""Racism is not a one-time incident,"" said Bo Thao-Urabe, executive director of the Coalition of Asian American Leaders (CAAL), a St. Paul nonprofit. ""What we are hearing about was not something that was just going to go away. … We were worried that it would get more violent.""
Across the United States, Asian Americans have faced increasing hostility, racism and discrimination since former President Donald Trump dubbed the coronavirus the ""China virus."" The outbreak is believed to have started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.
Thao-Urabe said her organization and others have been sounding the alarm as they've seen bias increasingly escalate from verbal attacks to physical assaults.
""We were worried things like this could happen,"" she said of Tuesday's shooting. ""This is not new. … We were concerned not enough was being done.""
Wednesday at the Legislature, Rep. Tou Xiong, DFL-Maplewood, led a moment of silence for the victims of the Atlanta shootings and urged Minnesotans to denounce rising anti-Asian bigotry.
Xiong, who chairs the Minnesota Asian Pacific Caucus, called on government leaders to do more to fight disinformation and a tide of hate crimes.
""Silence amidst this growing surge [in hate] against fellow Asian Americans is unacceptable,"" Xiong said.
On Wednesday evening, metro-area Asian Americans said they're being more cautious.
Sela Hafoka, a recent graduate of White Bear Lake High School who identifies as Asian-Polynesian American, said she believes Trump's ""China virus"" statements unleashed some of the racism.
She said one of her classmates told another whom she thought was Asian to go back to China. ""There's more blatant racism towards Asian Americans than before,"" Hafoka said.
Her mother, Ruth Hafoka, agreed, saying she has seen an increase in anti-Asian rhetoric on social media. ""I feel like we're the invisible, forgotten community,"" she added.
Rebecca Thao said she received worried texts from her mother soon after the first reports of the Georgia attacks.
""My mom texted me and said to be careful and not to start trouble with people,"" she said. ""When I'm by myself, I'm more cautious. I stay aware.""
Last year, Minnesota launched a discrimination helpline -- 1-833-454-0148 -- after bias reports against Asian Americans grew during the pandemic. More than 300,000 Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders representing various ethnic groups from Hmong to Indian and Vietnamese call Minnesota home. All told, they make up more than 5% of the state's population.
Since April 2020, about 7% of the Human Rights Department's COVID-related calls have been reports alleging anti-Asian Pacific Islander bias and discrimination -- which means Minnesotans of Asian descent are being affected to an extent that is disproportionate to their share of the population.
In January, CAAL backed President Joe Biden's presidential memorandum condemning racism and xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
The memo directed the U.S. Department of Justice to engage with the community on hate crimes, hate incidents and harassment, and directed the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the COVID-19 health equity task force to issue guidance on cultural competency, language access and sensitivity in light of Trump's comments.
CAAL created the Asian Minnesotan Alliance for Justice last May, in response to rising anti-Asian racism and the global outcry over racial injustice following the death of George Floyd.
Next Wednesday, the alliance will host a public community event online to increase awareness of victims of hate crimes and share how the community can help combat anti-Asian racism.
""People should feel safe and welcome no matter where they live and work … this is really up to us,"" Thao-Urabe said. ""I really believe that Minnesotans can do more and we should do more. Asian Minnesotans, like other communities, are struggling.""
When Thao-Urabe logged onto Zoom to host a webinar last April educating the community on the history of xenophobia and anti-racism, she froze.
While more than 500 participants had joined the webinar, some were racist trolls who inserted obscene comments and pictures into the virtual chat before the nonprofit shut it down.
On social media, #StopAsianHate trended online Wednesday. Both the Minnesota GOP and DFL parties issued statements condemning the violence, as did the People of Color and Indigenous Caucus and many other organizations.
Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan addressed the shooting Wednesday during an advocacy day address to the Minnesota chapter of Moms Demand Action.
She said racism and misogyny must be included in the state's debate over gun violence reduction and firearm legislation. The Moms Demand Action group called for legislation to expand criminal background checks on firearms sales and to adopt an extreme-risk protection order -- or ""red flag"" law -- that would allow a judge to order the removal of firearms from someone deemed a threat to themselves or others.
The legislation, prioritized by Democrats, is unlikely to pass the Republican-led Senate. A bill was also introduced by legislators this month that would expand the reporting of bias crimes and resources.

Hate incidents up against Asian Americans: State faces obstacles while collecting data as cases go underreported,Hal Conte and,Others,2021-03-09,"It's been about a year since Ellen Hartman took a walk with her husband and two young daughters along the Susquehanna riverfront in
Harrisburg, trying to get some fresh air and a respite amid a brewing pandemic.
She found little peace. Hartman, the senior vice president of the Central PA Korean Association, said she was accosted during the walk
by four young men shouting at her.
""There were a group of four males who began taunting me, yelling, calling me the coronavirus, throwing their arms towards me,"" she
said.
Because she had her 3-year-old daughter with her, Hartman said she didn't want to react.
""You could tell these four males are very angry and in their tone profanities, and my 3 year old was waving at them. She thought, 'oh
look, they're saying hello to me,'"" she said.
Hartman didn't report the incident to the police or state officials. Instead, she reported it to the Community Responders Network, a
grassroots coalition that works to reduce bias incidents in central Pennsylvania.
Her account was the third report on a list of 33 for 2020. The first report describes an unknown man in a pickup truck driving past an
Asian American Dickinson College student and yelling, blaming her for the coronavirus.
That was last March, when there were less than 50 reported cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania. Since then, the virus and
discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have grown in the state.
While the Community Responders Network has tallied at least 33 incidents, Chad Lassiter, the executive director of the Pennsylvania
Human Relations Commission, is reluctant to quote a figure, but recognized there has been an increase.
""We've seen an uptick throughout the state. It's challenging to gather numbers. Often times, these incidents go unreported or
underreported,"" he said.
For example, Hartman did not report her case to the state Human Relations Commission.
The uptick in Pennsylvania is in line with what's happening nationally:
The New York Police Department reported a 1,900% increase in reported hate crimes against Asian Americans in 2020.
Almost daily reports from the Bay Area of California show an increase in violence against Asian Americans, particularly elderly Asian
Americans.
Stop AAPI Hate, a database that has tracked racial violence during the coronavirus, received more than 2,800 reports of anti-Asian
discrimination from March through the end of December.
A rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans
Discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders continue to be reported this year.
Shortly after taking office in January, President Joe Biden signed an executive order Jan. 26, condemning racism, xenophobia and
intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
The order also instructed the COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force to issue guidance and best practices for advancing cultural
competency, language access and sensitivity towards Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
Biden also asked the U.S. Attorney General's Office to expand the collection of data and public reporting regarding hate incidents
against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
On Feb. 22, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf's Advisory Commission on Asian Pacific American Affairs condemned recent attacks on Asian
Pacific Americans across the country and called for all Pennsylvanians to stand up against anti-Asian hate and racism in all forms.
""From Oakland, California to Brooklyn, New York, innocent Asian elders have been severely injured or killed in wanton acts of violence.
Here in Pennsylvania, witnesses have reported more insidious forms of hate, including threats of bodily harm to Asian American high
school students and the casual use of the term ""COVID"" to name Asian-influenced food,"" a statement from the governor's office said.
But discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is not a new problem. It's an injustice that has been pervasive for
decades.
Reporting and documenting
Hartman said she has experienced racist hate crimes since childhood. Growing up outside Philadelphia, her family's house was tarred
with swastikas, a brick was thrown through her sister's window, and an attempt was even made to blow up her father's car.
But the perpetrators never faced justice, she said.Now that hate crimes and racism against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders are getting more attention, Hartman and other Asian-
Americans in Central Pennsylvania point to some recent generators of bigotry.That includes disinformation surrounding the coronavirus and the words of former President Donald Trump, who called COVID-19 ""the
China virus"" and ""kung flu"" during his 2020 campaign stops in Pennsylvania and throughout his nationally televised speeches.
Hartman said the actions of Trump created an environment where scapegoating is permitted, accusing the former president of ""reducing
us to the virus, dehumanizing us, and using phrases like 'the China virus' and the 'kung flu.'
""There is that stereotype, you know, the ""kung flu,"" said Joseph Romanoff, who is biracial and teaches Zumba classes at the New York
Fitness Club in Lebanon and whose mother came to the U.S. from the Philippines.
""But (this has) been going on for a long time. It's not in our heads.""
The difference, he said, is that now, ""racist attacks are being recorded and documented on social media.""
State Rep. Patty Kim, D-Dauphin County, has served the 103rd district since 2013 and is a former Harrisburg city councilwoman. She
said she has been concerned that many hateful incidents against Asian-Americans were going unreported.
""Growing up, I've had kids calling me names and pointing out I'm different. I thought that was the way of life,"" Kim said. ""People feel
very bad and embarrassed, and just want it to go away.""
""I want to encourage people of any race when you hear these kinds of comments and actions they should be reported and documented
to the Human Relations Commission and PA Attorney General,"" she said.
Kim said she's glad more people are taking notice of discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
""We need a culture shift. We don't need to tolerate this,"" she said.
Rural racism
Although a lot of the recent coverage has concentrated on cities such as San Francisco and New York, in more rural areas, this
dynamic can often be worse.
""Moving from Philadelphia to Central PA, I've experienced more microaggressions, more bias, more hate,"" Hartman said, recalling
being asked to leave a party where a Confederate flag was being displayed and being shouted at with racist epithets while drinking a
milkshake at the Pennsylvania Farm Show.
As a leader at the Central PA Korean Association, Hartman said organizations like hers could help connect people that may have never
met an Asian-American person before.
""There are individuals who have gone their entire life not having a close friend or a colleague who's Asian, and all they're hearing is
about Asian-Americans being viruses, or the carriers of disease, or invaders, or taking jobs away,"" she said.
""In smaller, rural towns that are predominantly one race, one culture, maybe you don't have other cultures coming in....I think
there's so many opportunities in this globally networked world to break from that.""
The bigotry can take on both overt and less obvious characters, particularly surrounding the coronavirus.
""You see people walk away from us in the grocery store,"" Kim said. ""It's hard to prove, it's subtle, but I believe it's happening....I've
experienced that a couple times but don't know what they were thinking of.""
Kim said that larger cities with more diversity were able to pick up on patterns of racism more quickly.
Hartman said she was the only teacher of color when teaching at high schools in Central Pennsylvania and experienced
microaggressions.
Romanoff said his mother had also been subject to racial bigotry from students at Central Pennsylvania schools when she was a
teacher, with students telling her to ""go back to China"" and mimicking slanted eyes.
His mother came as a chemist, but there is a false belief that Asian immigrants are taking jobs, he said.
""A lot of Filipinos feel like they have to dumb down their resumes just to get hired,"" he added.
Romanoff said he was harassed as a kid by people saying he would be deported if an election was won by Ross Perot, a former
business executive who mounted two third-party presidential bids on anti-free trade and nativist themes in the 1990s.
""It makes me sick,"" Romanoff said. ""America is supposed to be a country of freedom. But we have to be honest with ourselves.""

"CANADIANS MUST ‘STAND UP' IN FIGHT AGAINST ANTI-ASIAN HATE CRIMES, ADVOCATE SAYS",None,Others,2021-03-20,"Amy Go says she was saddened by the shootings in Atlanta that left six Asian-American women dead, but as an Asian-Canadian woman, she wasn't surprised.
Ms. Go, the president of the Chinese Canadian National Council for Social Justice, said many Asian-Canadian women have experienced hatred or violence in their daily life.
""There's so much pain and grief,"" she said about her initial reaction to the attack. ""At the same time, as Asian-Canadian women, none of us were surprised. There was no sense of shock. It was as if we knew this was coming ... it just happened to be in Atlanta.""
The killings follow a wave of recent attacks against Asian Americans and Canadians since the novel coronavirus arrived in North America.
The national council has tracked 931 anti-Asian racist incidents during COVID-19, and Ms. Go said the numbers should highlight myths about how Canadians view themselves.
""This myth about Canada that we are multicultural, more kind, we're gentler than Americans, to me that's just a myth. As racialized Canadians, particularly racialized women, we know that the reality is quite different,"" she said.
Federal Trade Minister Mary Ng, who was born in Hong Kong before moving to Canada when she was 7, said she's been the victim of discrimination.
""Every time I speak out about the need for us to keep working together as Canadians to prevent more intolerance and incidents of anti-Asian hate or discrimination, I will get a whole lot of other responses that are not becoming of Canadians,"" she said in an interview.
She said the news of Tuesday's attack left her feeling ""horrified"" and she emphasized the need for Canadians to offer support to the Asian-Canadian community.
""I think the request is that Asian Canadians need all Canadians to stand alongside us, to speak out and to be vocal and to stand against anti-Asian racism and to certainly stand up for us in this fight,"" Ms. Ng said.
Police in major cities across Canada have recorded increases in hate crimes in the past year, although not all could identify the specific targets of the alleged crimes.
Toronto police say they have seen an increase in the number of hate-motivated occurrences, comparing 2019 with 2020 - including incidents against Asian people - but could not provide data.
Ottawa police reported an increase of 56.9 per cent in the number of hate-crime reports between 2019 and 2020, and noted Asian Canadians have seen the largest increase in hate incidents directed toward them.
Henry Yu, an associate professor in the University of British Columbia's history department, said Asians have historically been blamed for a range of societal problems in Canada.

Area residents of Asian descent decry stereotypes,"Wilson, M. ",Others,2021-03-24,"Lily Hubbard remembers it like yesterday, the day two years ago when quiet fell over her 10th-grade class.
""A substitute teacher asked me if I was an exchange student,"" she said.
Her silent Henderson County High School classmates knew. Adopted as a baby from China in 2003, Lily grew up alongside them, shared the same childhood experiences, the same milestones, the same teenage hopes and dreams.
What they don't share, however, are the experiences faced by Asians in the United States on a daily basis. The awkward silence precipitated by the substitute teacher's question was a reminder.
By the time she got home from school that day, Lily recalled, she was stewing over the incident.
""It just reiterates I don't belong here. It's like a punch to the face,"" she said.
Now 18 and a high school senior, Lily is outspoken and passionate about her cultural heritage and respecting others' differences.
Recent violence and hate incidents directed toward Asians nationwide, including last week's Atlanta shootings that killed eight people, including six women, have intensified the fear felt in a community already facing derogatory rhetoric and hate speech.
Members of the Evansville area's Asian community say they are concerned about the rise in hate incidents and violence but those the Courier & Press spoke with said they haven't experienced such blatant racism here.
What they do experience, at times, is a general lack of cultural understanding and an environment in which Asian stereotypes are perpetuated.
""Most of my experiences have been lame jokes, stereotypes, derogatory words. A lot of times they are about me and sometimes Asians in general,"" Lily said. ""I try in my calmest way, I just tell them, 'That's not right, it's really offensive, can you stop.'""
The best solution, she said, is to speak up.
""Make people accountable,"" she said.
That's how Beth and Joey Hubbard say they raised their daughter.
""We wanted to raise her to know that people will not always be kind. She always knows we have her back,"" Beth Hubbard said. ""When things have happened we have asked her if she wanted us to say something or if she wanted to do something herself. We've tried to let her develop self-confidence because we have always felt that as long as she could learn to use her voice to stick up for herself that she will be all right.""
Bohan Ye, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Southern Indiana, grew up in China and came to the United States to teach. She has lived in Evansville since July 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic was raging.
She believes misinformation about the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has helped perpetuate some of the current climate of anger directed toward the Asian community.
She said she was taken aback when one of her students, while discussing an assignment in class, said the coronavirus was created in China – even though its origins are still being investigated.
""My students are 18-19 years old. I thought, it's this kind of environment that makes them think and believe this way. It's a problem of society,"" she said.
Jenbien Tsai has live in Evansville since 1987, working as a civil engineer for the Indiana Department of Transportation after receiving his master's degree from the University of Louisville. He said that during his time here the local Chinese community has grown and diversified but the national climate has become less open.
""I can see the U.S. today is not the U.S. it was in the 1980s or even the 1990s. It's not as tolerant, not as welcoming to new arrivals,"" Tsai said. ""Part of it, maybe, is economic reasons. Some think new immigrants are here to steal their jobs. Politicians fan the fire.""
Tsai worries people in the local Asian community could become easy targets because of the cultural tendency to remain quiet and keep to themselves.
""Asian people normally don't want to raise hell when there is mistreatment. They just keep it to themselves,"" he said.
Wini Peng-Atkins recalls what it was like being an Asian in the small-town environment of Oakland City, Indiana. She moved there in 2005 to get her master's degree and then teach at Oakland City University. She taught business at the University of Evansville from 2015 until she was laid off in December 2020.
""When I first came in 2005 I was practically the only Chinese girl walking around in Oakland City,"" she said. ""People were not mean, they were just curious.""
She lives in Fort Branch, Indiana, with her husband and four sons. While she doesn't feel like she has experienced overt discrimination or hostility, Peng-Atkins said she worries for her sons in the current climate.
""Some Asians can't express themselves – some people who are from older generations, especially. We are taught to blend in and not be involved. Ever since school we are taught not to stick out. They are scared of politics,"" she said. ""It's hard for Americans to understand that.""

My low-level anxiety about being Asian in America has transformed into fear OP-ED,"Sharon, K. S.",Others,2021-03-08,"My parents live on the outskirts of Atlanta, and I am worried about them.
Since the start of the pandemic, there has been a significant uptick in hate crimes against Asians in America. In
the past few weeks, we've seen horrifying reports of Asian Americans being harassed and punched, an elderly
man thrown to the ground and killed in San Francisco, another slashed in the face and left to bleed inside a New
York City subway car, as well as countless videos of enraged people shouting at Asian Americans to go back to
their countries and even spitting in their faces.
The recent turn of events is shocking but not surprising. For many Asian Americans, anti-Asian sentiments are
borne in silence and isolation. I grew up mostly being embarrassed about my Korean heritage. In the U.S., we
Koreans have to prove that we are American, even if we were born and raised here, by pushing ourselves to
excel at school and work. As children, some of us refused to learn to speak Korean. By doing so, we shed much
of our ethnic identities.
I was always acutely aware of how I should try to fit in. When I was 4 years old, we moved to Vancouver,
Canada, where we lived in a predominantly white neighborhood. When I started elementary school in the late
1970s, many people had never heard of Korea. Another Asian girl in my class by the name of Ming Ming would
sit at the corner of one of the long lunch tables with her thermos of noodles. The other children would wince at
the smell. I did not fare better. Next to her, I would open up my doshirak, a Korean lunch box packed with fried rice, meat and vegetables and a pair of chopsticks that fit neatly inside. Mimicking the other children, I would
scrunch up my nose at my own lunchbox and pretend that its contents were equally offensive to me.When I got home, I cornered my mother. Why couldn't she just pack me a normal lunch like peanut-butter-and-
jelly sandwiches?""How is that even healthy?"" my mother countered. ""There are no vegetables in there!"" But my mother obliged,
and to my relief, I was sent to school with a Western-styled sandwich.
One of my mother's favorite words in Korean is cham-ah, meaning to endure. It is what she and her family had
to do when they escaped North Korea during the winter of 1950. Traveling on foot from Pyongyang to Seoul,
they crossed icy rivers and ran for cover from bombings and artillery fire before riding on the roof of a U.S.
military cargo train from Seoul to Daegu.
My parents arrived in Los Angeles in the 1970s and worked as janitors at the Shubert Theater, saving money to
buy their first grocery store in a Spanish-speaking neighborhood. Unable to secure a permanent visa for our
family, we moved to Canada, where they cleaned fish at a local market and bought a hardware store. When my
mom got her medical technologist certification, she found a job in New York and we moved back to the States.
Through all of their struggles to make ends meet, they instilled in us the concept of enduring. If someone
mistreated us, we were told not to make a fuss. Cham-ah. When my schoolteacher told my parents that my
Korean name was too difficult to pronounce, they consulted our church minister, who provided us with
Americanized names. Giving up our Korean names was a small price to pay to fit in. Cham-ah.
Even today, I will rarely speak out when someone throws out a racial slur. I think to myself, is it really worth it?
It could be so much worse. Cham-ah.
All my life I felt like being Asian in America was a shortcoming I had to make up for by working hard and not
sticking out too much. But recently, this low-grade anxiety has morphed into actual fear. Fear for my aging
parents, relatives and their friends.
I am hoping the coming herd immunity against the coronavirus might bring with it a new era of racial tolerance.
That vanquishing COVID-19 might also mean diminishing these racial attacks, particularly on our elders whom
we have been raised to respect and honor. But we can't wait for that to happen. It is time to speak up about
anti-Asian hate crimes.

Anti-Asian American hate crimes reported to police rose 149 percent between 2019 and 2020,"AMY SHERMAN --, P.",Others,2021-03-21,"Hate crimes against asian americans rise
As pandemic shutdowns and fear flooded the United States last spring, it brought with it a wave of hate crimes and incidents targeting Asian Americans.
Some were prosecuted as hate crimes, such as a woman in the Bronx who was hit on the head with an umbrella as her assailants used anti-Asian comments. Other incidents may not have resulted in official charges, such as the hurling of racist slurs.
Researchers say they have seen a trend of increasing hate crimes and hateful incidents targeting Asian Americans during the pandemic, documented by community members and journalists over the past year. A mass shooting at Atlanta-area spas on March 16 resulted in eight deaths, the majority of the victims Asian American women. The AP reported that South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said that four of the victims who died were women of Korean descent.
Law enforcement has not yet concluded if the gunman, Robert Aaron Long, will be charged with a hate crime, although legal experts have said that’s possible. Long, a 21-year-old white man, faces eight counts of murder.
Following the Georgia attacks, many politicians and journalists cited two key organizations that had compiled data documenting either hate crimes reported to police or a more broad category of hateful incidents.
The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University released findings in early March that showed hate crimes against Asian Americans spiked 149 percent between 2019 and 2020, even though hate crimes overall declined.
A separate group, Stop AAPI Hate, catalogued nearly 3,800 hateful incidents — which is not limited to crimes — during the first year of the pandemic. (AAPI stands for Asian American and Pacific Islander.) Most of those hateful incidents targeted women.
These numbers are the best available data as of now to show the trend of an increase in anti-Asian hate during the pandemic. But even these numbers are likely a small fraction of actual incidents, including crimes.
“There are barriers to reporting,” said Jeannine Bell, an Indiana University law professor and expert on hate crimes. “Individual victims have to feel as if they are comfortable enough to report, and most likely they don’t.”
Data on hate crimes
The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism is a longtime respected source of expertise on hate crimes. Researchers used public records from local and state police agencies to gather hate crime reports in 2019 and compare them with 2020.
They focused on anti-Asian hate crimes reported to police in 16 of the largest U.S. cities.
The center found anti-Asian hate crimes rose from 49 crimes in 2019 to 122 in 2020, an increase of 149 percent. Researchers faulted negative stereotyping of Asians during the early rise of COVID-19 cases last spring for the first spike.
The spike in hate crimes against Asian Americans was even more glaring because overall hate crimes dropped 7 percent overall, amid pandemic-driven closures of businesses, schools and public gatherings.
The report doesn’t mention former President Donald Trump. However, it does show that Google searches found spikes for racist terms such as “China virus” and “Kung Flu” spiked throughout 2020. Trump used those terms multiple times that year — including “China virus” as recently as a March 16 interview on Fox News, although there was nothing in his interview to indicate that he knew about the shootings that took place that evening in Georgia.
“Presidential statements have correlated both to increases and decreases in hate crime,” said Brian Levin, director of the center which wrote the report. “It is notable that on March 23, (2020), when President Trump refrained from ethnic terms relating to the virus for a day and spoke of tolerance, there were no anti-Asian hate crimes in NYC in what otherwise was a historically bad month for hate crime.”
On that day, Trump said that the virus was not the fault of Chinese Americans and tweeted: “It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world.”
After becoming president in January, Joe Biden signed a memo condemning the “inflammatory and xenophobic rhetoric” against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. He called on the attorney general to explore opportunities to combat hate crimes.
The FBI’s hate crime data shows that anti-Asian hate crimes declined in the late 1990s and started to climb in recent years. In 2019, there were 7,314 hate crime incidents overall, according to the FBI, including 158 that were against people of Asian descent. The FBI will release 2020 hate crime figures later this year.
Stop AAPI Hate
In response to an escalation of bigotry during the pandemic, community groups and the Asian American Studies Department of San Francisco State formed Stop AAPI Hate. The group invites Asian Americans who have experienced hate to report the incidents.
This group logged 3,795 incidents from March 19, 2020, to Feb. 28, 2021. That number represents “only a fraction of the number of hate incidents that actually occur, but it does show how vulnerable Asian Americans are to discrimination, and the types of discrimination they face,” the group wrote.
Verbal harassment and shunning — the deliberate avoidance of Asian Americans — made up the two largest proportions of the total incidents reported. Physical assaults comprised 11 percent of the incidents. Chinese Americans were the largest ethnic group (42.2 percent) that report experiencing hate.
The report detailed racist insults and accusations of bringing the virus to the United States directed at Asian Americans while they were shopping, using public transportation or online. One parent reported that the owner of a gymnastics business refused to enroll the daughter because of her name.
Stop AAPI Hate focuses on hate incidents more broadly than just crimes in order to analyze widespread manifestations of racism, said Russell Jeung, a leader of Stop AAPI Hate and professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University.
“We started tracking for coughing/spitting incidents because we saw such a clear trend in our respondents’ reports,” Jeung said.
Hate crimes are undercounted
Hate crimes against Asian Americans are “massively underreported,” Levin said.
Asian Americans may be reluctant to contact law enforcement for a variety of reasons that can include language or cultural barriers, distrust of police, or fear of repercussions for their immigration status if they aren’t citizens.
It can also be difficult to prove an attacker’s racial bias, said Jeung.
There have been efforts to increase the reporting of hate crimes in recent years. In Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp signed a law in June that mandated the collection and reporting of hate crimes by law enforcement. The law followed the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man who was jogging and shot by a former police officer.
The bill removed Georgia from the few states with no hate crime law on the books.
U.S. Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y. and Sen. Mazie K. Hirono, D-Hawaii, introduced a bill in March, days before the Georgia shooting, that would designate a Justice Department employee to expedite review of COVID-19 hate crimes.
In the Georgia mass shooting case, the relevance of a hate crime charge wouldn’t change the expected amount of time the gunman will spend in prison. But in general, a hate crime charge serves the important purpose of sending a message to the broader community.
“There is a broader concern about the impact it is having on people who are vulnerable, isolated and traumatized beyond the individual victims,” said Steven Freeman, vice president of civil rights at the Anti-Defamation League, an organization that tracks anti-Semitic hate crimes and has called for stronger state laws.
Law enforcement may not charge an incident as a hate crime if there isn’t clearly identifiable evidence that race was the motivation of the attacker. But for the community that feels victimized, the hate crime charge is important.
“It’s an acknowledgement to the community that someone did something because of bias,” Bell said.

The Atlanta Shootings Fit Into a Long Legacy of Anti-Asian Violence in America,SyndiGate Media Inc,Others,2021-03-19,"It was heartbreaking and horrifying—but to many, it wasn’t a surprise.The news that eight people, six of them Asian-American women, were killed at businesses in the Atlanta area on March 16 came after a year of intense anti-Asian racism in the U.S. On the platforms where news arrives first, and quickly attaches to feelings, emotions were already raw.“This mass shooter was targeting Asian women and their businesses. This isn’t an isolated incident. There have been 500+ hate crimes targeted at Asian people this year alone,” social media specialist Mark Kim wrote on Twitter. “This Atlanta tragedy lies at an intersection of race, gender, class and the legacy of America’s history of colonization and violence in Asia,” journalist Elise Hu said on the site. “I don’t have the words. I’m just despondent. Protect Asian women, solidarity with sex workers, #StopAsianHate.”And as posts went viral, with comments affirming their calls for change, the news kept coming. “Atlanta shooting suspect told investigators that killings of Asian women weren’t racially motivated, police say,” said a Washington Post news alert. A quote from a Daily Beast story described the alleged shooter–who was charged on March 17 with eight counts of murder–as the son of a pastor who was “very innocent seeming.” Meanwhile the victims remained nameless. Later in the day, four were identified: Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Xiaojie Yan, 49; and Daoyou Feng, 44. Additionally, Elcias R. Hernandez-Ortiz, 30, was injured in the attack. (Officials from the Atlanta police department are not naming the other victims until their families are notified.) By the time their names were made public, the suspect would already be accounted for by a member of the Cherokee County sheriff’s office who, in a video that was widely circulated, said: “Yesterday was a really bad day for him and this is what he did.”In the dissonance was confirmation of what many Asian Americans already knew: the violence that has long targeted their community is rarely seen for what it is. Since the start of the pandemic last spring, Asian Americans have faced racist violence at a much higher rate than in previous years. Stop AAPI Hate, a reporting database created at the beginning of the pandemic as a response to the increase in racial violence, received 3,795 reports of anti-Asian discrimination between March 19, 2020, and Feb. 28, 2021; women reported hate incidents at 2.3 times the rate of men.After his capture, the police noted that the shooter said he was seeking to address a “sexual addiction” and “was not racially motivated.” But for Asian women, racism and misogyny are deeply intertwined. A 2018 report from the American Psychological Association outlined the ways in which Asian-American women are exoticized and objectified in media and popular culture, depicted as “faceless, quiet and invisible, or as sexual objects.” The survey said these stereotypes “contribute to experiences of marginalization, invisibility and oppression” for Asian-American women. On March 16, America saw that reality manifest in the most brutal way.From the time the first wave of Chinese immigrants arrived as laborers in the U.S. in the 1850s, Asian Americans have always been subject to racist violence. As a source of cheap labor to build railroads, Asian immigrants came to be seen as threats to white jobs and scapegoated as dirty and disease-ridden. The “yellow peril” ultimately led to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first time the U.S. had ever barred a specific ethnic group from the country.The brutality runs through more than two centuries of U.S. history, from the incarceration camps of World War II, when over 100,000 Japanese Americans were rounded up and imprisoned because of xenophobic fears, to the 1982 murder of Vincent Chin, who died after being beaten by white men in a racially motivated attack in Detroit.Yet while racial violence has been an undeniable part of the history of Asian Americans in the U.S., the pervasive “model minority” myth has helped to obscure it. That false idea, constructed during the civil rights era to stymie racial-justice movements, suggests that Asian Americans are more successful than other ethnic minorities because of hard work, education and inherently law-abiding natures. Racial-justice educator Bianca Mabute-Louie emphasizes the connection between this damaging stereotype and the violence we’ve seen on the news–videos featuring Asian-American elders shoved to the ground. “This contributes to erasing the very real interpersonal violence that we see happening in these videos, and that Asian Americans experience from the day-to-day, things that don’t get reported and the things that don’t get filmed,” she says.Because the myth suggests upward mobility, it creates a fallacy that Asian Americans don’t experience struggle or racial discrimination. In reality, the community is America’s most economically divided: a 2018 study by the Pew Research Center found that Asian Americans experience the largest income-inequality gap as an ethnic and racial group in the U.S.The current surge in anti-Asian hate crimes was exacerbated by the xenophobic rhetoric of former President Donald Trump, who has continued to refer to COVID-19 as “the China virus,” blaming the country for the pandemic. Trump’s choice of words followed a long American history of using diseases to justify anti-Asian xenophobia–one that has helped to shape perception of Asian Americans as “perpetual foreigners.” “There’s a clear correlation between President Trump’s incendiary comments, his insistence on using the term Chinese virus, and the subsequent hate speech spread on social media and the hate violence directed toward us,” says Russell Jeung, a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate and a professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University.Anti-Asian racism also surged during the pandemic in Britain and Australia, with incidents of discrimination and xenophobia reported last summer by Human Rights Watch in Italy, Russia and Brazil. The news from Atlanta landed hard in Asian communities already feeling extraordinarily vulnerable. “We’re all feeling a collective trauma at the moment,” says Mai-Anh Peterson, co-founder of besea.n (Britain’s East and South East Asian Network). “We know that this isn’t just a problem for North America.”President Joe Biden has sought to undo the damage wrought by his predecessor. Shortly after taking office in January, he signed an Executive Order denouncing anti-Asian discrimination. During a March 11 speech on the anniversary of the COVID-19 pandemic, he said that hate crimes against Asian Americans are “un-American” and that they “must stop.” Five days later, the gunman started shooting.The President was not alone. One day before the shootings, Dr. Michelle Au, a state senator of East Asian descent in Georgia, spoke out on the imminent danger faced by the Asian community during the pandemic. “Asian Americans are part of our country’s plurality,” she said. “Recognize that we need help, we need protection, and we need people in power to stand up for us against hate.”What form that protection takes has been part of a heated debate among Asian Americans, particularly in the wake of a national reckoning over systemic racism and police brutality after the killing of George Floyd in May. During a recent surge in physical violence ahead of Lunar New Year, actors Daniel Dae Kim and Daniel Wu shared on Twitter a video of a 91-year-old man being pushed down in Oakland, Calif., Chinatown. They offered a $25,000 reward to anyone who could provide information about the attacker, who had also pushed down a 60-year-old man as well as a 55-year-old woman, who was left unconscious from the attack.Kim’s tweet brought up mixed feelings within the AAPI community: his attempt to raise awareness tapped into a longtime grievance of many Asian Americans–that violence against them has often been downplayed or ignored. At the same time, the offer of a reward–particularly in a situation where the alleged attacker was a Black man–underscored the difficulty of tackling anti-Asian violence without relying on law-enforcement institutions that have historically targeted Black and brown communities. (The Oakland police charged 28-year-old Yahya Muslim with assault, battery and elder abuse.) “This looks a lot like a bounty on a Black person funded by Asian-American celebrities,” wrote writer and consultant Kim Tran. “I have major, major doubts.”Rather than turning to additional policing, community leaders have stressed the importance of grassroots organizing at this time, as well as the need for cross-community solidarity. “We know that this is an issue that affects all our communities, and we have to break the cycle of violence,” says Jeung, the Stop AAPI Hate co-founder.Additional policing doesn’t pose a threat just to Black and brown communities; people of Asian descent have also suffered disproportionately at the hands of law enforcement. In the aftermath of the March 16 killings, many were reminded of the 2017 death of Yang Song, a massage-parlor worker who fell to her death while trying to escape a police raid in Flushing, Queens: “Don’t tell me increased police presence will save us,” tweeted writer Mia Sato. For activists, stories like Song’s are a reminder of the need to build solidarity across racial, economic and social lines. “Asians with power and visibility should be appalled that white men are targeting our most vulnerable groups–poor, immigrant women,” writer and activist Roslyn Talusan said on Twitter. “Protecting and advocating for Asian sex workers should be the founding pillars of any movement for racial justice in Asian communities.”Details of the Atlanta crimes are still being gathered. But at ground level, the impact was immediate.”We’re closed today because everybody is afraid,” Grace Wang, manager of a local Atlanta spa, says. “All employees are worried to come to work, and customers too and we decided to close until we find out what happened.”There are no quick solutions to racial violence. What Biden calls “un-American” is, after all, deeply rooted in American history. Ending anti-Asian racism in the U.S. means confronting centuries of discrimination, violence and oppression, and recognizing how it manifests in the present day. As Au noted in her statements this week, “This is a new chapter in a very old story.” In order to write a new story, we have to acknowledge the ugly past that brought us here.

Hoosiers protest anti-Asian violence: Monument Circle demonstration one of several Saturday across US,"Contreras, N. E.",Others,2021-03-28,"Last summer, Ling Liu, of Indianapolis, marched in solidarity with her Black Hoosier neighbors to demand justice, an end to racism and violence.
On Saturday, she demanded the same for Asian American Hoosiers as anti-Asian hate crimes and violence have surged in the U.S. over the past year.
Earlier this month, eight people were killed in a shooting in Atlanta, six of the victims were Asian women. Violence also has been fueled by racist rhetoric about the coronavirus pandemic.
Liu joined about a hundred people who gathered at Monument Circle Saturday to rally against anti-Asian violence and demand an end to bigotry, xenophobia and racism.
""We are Americans, we are mothers, we are friends, we live here,"" Liu said. ""We love our community. This affects all of us, and we don't want any violence against anyone.""
The rally was hosted by the Indianapolis Chinese Community Center Inc., the Asian American Alliance Inc., and other Asian American and Pacific Islander organizations in Indianapolis such as the America China Society of Indiana, the Korean American Association of Indiana, the Burmese American Community Institute, and the Asian American Association at Indiana University. Members of the Indiana Chapter of ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism) were also in attendance.
Similar demonstrations were held the same day in 60 other cities across the United States, including Atlanta, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.
Quanbo Xiong, who is the Indianapolis Chinese Community Center Inc. president, said Asian American Hoosiers are scared and hurt.
""But if we don't do anything (the violence) will happen to us someday,"" Xiong said. ""We have to act and raise our voice, raise awareness on tolerance, on Asian history.""
According to a report by Stop AAPI Hate, more than 3,800 hate crimes against Asian American and Pacific Islander communities had been reported in the United States since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.
Anti-Asian incidents document in Indiana communities
There's no data yet available about the total of anti-Asian harassment incidents in Indiana, but some incidents have been documented in Plymouth, Chesterton, Martinsville and Mooresville.
The Anti-Defamation League tracked increases in white supremacist hate propaganda activity. In 2020, 57 such incidents were reported in Indiana, which is a 24% increase from 2019.
Deputy Mayor Thomas, Congressman Carson attend event
Judith Thomas, Indianapolis deputy mayor of neighborhood engagement, and U.S. Rep. André Carson, a Democrat who represents Indianapolis, were among the speakers at the event.
Thomas told the crowd Saturday that the city of Indianapolis hears and sees the Asian American communities and their concerns.
""The city is behind you,"" she said. ""We know diversity is one of our greatest assets and we need to celebrate that. This also means we need to listen to those who are suffering and figure out what we can do next.""
Carson said in order to fight hatred brewing in the country, elected officials must fight racism together.
""Politicians, we have to come together and put aside our differences,"" he said. ""We need more allies to tell America that we will not stand for bigotry, xenophobia, or anything that seeks to oppress this community.""
According to Census data, Asian Hoosiers make up nearly 4% of Marion County's population and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Hoosiers make up less than 1%.
The population has grown in some Indianapolis suburbs and surrounding counties.
Asian Hoosiers make up 6% of Hamilton County's population, 7% of Monroe County's and 4% of Johnson County's population. Statewide, Asian Hoosiers make up nearly 3% of the population. And according to the Migration Policy Institute, 34% of immigrants living in Indiana in 2019 were Asian.

Protesting hate crimes: LI rallies support Asian American communities,"Salamanca, J., & Asbury, J.",Others,2021-03-28,"For Howard Fei, Saturday's rally in Hauppauge to protest violence against Asian Americans was a way for him to show that he could not stay silent on the recent attacks against people of Asian ancestry in Atlanta, New York and the West Coast.
""The United States is a strong country because it welcomes people of all backgrounds from everywhere to live here. As a country, we should be united together, and we should not be separated by this kind of diversity,"" said Fei, 35, of Stony Brook, a U.S. Army veteran who carried a sign that read ""We are not silent on racism.""
""Stop the Hate"" was the message that Fei and hundreds of people chanted at the Saturday rally outside Suffolk County's H. Lee Dennison Building in Hauppauge, where local, state and federal elected officials joined representatives from law enforcement and civil rights activists to speak out against the spike in hate crimes nationwide targeting Asian Americans that has sparked similar rallies across the country.
In New Hyde Park on Saturday about two dozen protesters marched to stop Asian hate.
In Hauppauge, Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone, whose office co-sponsored the rally outside the Dennison Building along with the Suffolk County Asian American Advisory Board, said the rally was a clear message that ""hatred and intolerance was unacceptable"" in Suffolk or anywhere else.
""Too many of our brothers and sisters, our fellow Americans in the Asian American and the Pacific Islander community, have been subject to verbal assaults and physical violence. We are here to say this is unacceptable. We will never tolerate acts of hate like this here in Suffolk County. And if you dare to commit a hate crime here, you will be prosecuted here to the fullest extent of the law, no doubt about that,"" Bellone said.
Several speakers at the rally heavily criticized Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-Shirley), who was in attendance, for not supporting a resolution introduced by Rep. Grace Meng (D-Queens) in the U.S. House condemning anti-Asian hate related to the COVID-19 pandemic and for his support of former President Donald Trump, whose labeling of the COVID-19 virus as ""the China virus"" was seen as fanning the flames for violence against Asian Americans this past year.
""We need everybody who says they support us to actually support us. No more platitudes,"" State Sen. John C. Liu (D-Flushing) said.
Tracey Edwards, the Long Island regional director of the NAACP, didn't mention Zeldin by name, but she said people must stand together ""against everyone who is going to attend a rally, but then vote for hate.""
""We need all of our elected officials, local elected officials, state elected officials, national elected officials,"" at which point Edwards turned to look behind her at Zeldin, ""to vote for justice, to vote against hate. We have to come together to stand for all of us. It cannot be selective,"" Edwards said.
Zeldin, speaking at the rally, said he stood with the Asian American community, pointing out that his wife, Diana Zeldin, was of Asian ancestry.
""There's a time for government and there's a time for politics, and right now, each and every one of you are here, I hope, for all of the right reasons, to condemn the violence targeting Asians, the anti-Asian sentiment, and I thank you,"" Zeldin said.
Speaking to Newsday reporters after the rally, Zeldin defended his vote on that resolution, saying the resolution was pushed as a ""pro-Trump, anti-Trump resolution.""
""I think this conversation shouldn't be about that, but that's my personal opinion,"" Zeldin said.
Tsai Wei Sun, 45, of Huntington Station, said she hopes that the rallies will inspire people to speak out when they see violence or acts of hate against Asian Americans being committed.
""I want people to be nice to be kind to one another. If we see people being discriminated against, we should stand up and say something,"" Sun said.
In New Hyde Park, protesters marched down Jericho Turnpike chanting, ""This is what community looks like"" and ""Stop Asian Hate.""
Andrea Valentino, 43, of Massapequa Park, came to the rally with her mother and her 7-year-old daughter, holding signs like, ""I am not a virus. Hatred is the virus.""
""I felt very alone when I moved to Long Island. I see this turnout and how it affects all people,"" Valentino said. ""We need to have a voice. We've been silent for too long. Unfortunately it's taken a tragedy to bring us out together.""
A diverse group, joined with protesters who have previously organized Black Lives Matter rallies, called for unity in the community and ending racism and discrimination against Asian communities and all races.
The rally was organized by Long Island Peaceful Protests and leader Terrel Tuosto.
""In wake of a rash of hate crimes against our Asian brothers and sisters, we must stand up and fight against Asian hate. If you let this slide, it's like saying it's OK to happen,"" Tuosto said. ""Everyone deserves to have human rights that do not exist in this country. These attacks are for no reason other than wearing skin and looking different than you look.""

ASIAN STUDENTS MORE LIKELY TO STAY HOME: 37% OF STUDENTS IN GRADES 4K-5 WHO IDENTIFIED AS ASIAN PLANNED TO RETURN,"Girard, S.",Others,2021-03-31,"While the demographics of 4K-5 students opting to return for in-person instruction in the Madison Metropolitan School District are relatively level, there is a noticeable outlier: Asian students.
Just 37% of students in grades 4K-5 who identified as Asian planned to return for in-person instruction when the district reopened earlier this month, compared to about 60% or more for most demographic groups, though Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander students were also at just 44%.
It's part of a nationwide trend that Peng Her, the Hmong Institute's CEO and an outreach specialist at the UW-Madison Institute for Research on Poverty, was not surprised to see play out in Madison. Her cited three factors he believes contribute to the lower percentage returning: multigenerational households, an increase in hate crimes against Asians and Asian Americans and the ""model minority myth"" that leads many to believe Asian families and students are doing well.
""Those three factors really as a parent make you think about, as schools are reopening, how safe is your child going to be physically going to school?"" said Her, who has two children in middle school. ""Secondly, how safe are they with coronavirus and potentially bringing it back to their family?""
The Washington Post reported that in New York City, Asian American children make up under 12% of students back in classrooms, though they are 18% of the overall student body, with similar disparities in other districts around the country. Federal data released Wednesday showed that as of January, 68% of Asian fourth graders were learning fully virtually - above any other demographic, and more than double the 27% of white fourth-graders.
Asian students make up 8.4% of MMSD's overall enrollment, according to the Department of Public Instruction.
Her, state Rep. Francesca Hong and Lake View Elementary School Principal Nkaujnou Vang-Vue all noted in interviews that the ""Asian"" demographic includes a variety of cultures that differ from each other.
""I think people tend to lump Asian Americans in together,"" Her said. ""You have some high-achieving Asian Americans who have been in this country for generations, then you have the recent refugees.""
A lack of nuance can make it harder to identify the challenges people in the community face.
Vang-Vue said she works closely with her school's Hmong families, as she speaks Hmong and has built up a familiarity with them over the years. For the families she's worked with, she said, there is still fear about the virus as the pandemic continues.
""I don't even think I got two words into the conversation and they're like, 'Nope, we're not sending them,'"" Vang-Vue said. ""The fear is real.""
She suggested that fear, mixed with ""a lot lost in the translation"" from English to Hmong when sharing safety precautions, contribute to the lower return rate.
Hong kept her son in virtual learning for the initial return partly to protect her and her partner's parents until they get vaccinated. She said the district will have to connect to the variety of populations it serves to help students and families recover from the pandemic.
""I know the administration is trying to get more resources for mental health resources for kids, and I applaud them for that,"" she said. ""I would hope they would also look at ... liaisons to specific communities.""
School challenges
The ""model minority myth"" perpetuates the idea that all Asians and Asian Americans are high-achieving.
Hong, whose parents immigrated to Madison from South Korea in 1987, called the myth ""incredibly divisive"" and said it minimizes the conversations about how to help specific communities within the overall demographic. She said it can also hurt other minority groups as people use the myth as a justification to cut aid programs.
""It perpetuates a scarcity mindset for minority communities, especially Asian communities,"" Hong said.
Her said it took nearly a decade to get MMSD to disaggregate Hmong data from broader Asian data. Once they did, it was clear Hmong students were struggling to keep reading and math at grade level, Her said.
Knowledge of how various groups of students are struggling can be key to understanding ""how we can help each community, because each community has different needs and challenges,"" Her said.
At Lake View, Vang-Vue said, staffers on her social services team are assigned to connect with specific communities. They reach out through emails, phone calls, text messages and ""any way that we can to connect with them to help them troubleshoot and problem-solve around any challenges.""
She noted that they have delivered food to families and worked to help overcome other barriers throughout the last year, and they're working to make learning - virtual or in-person - the best it can be for all of their students.
""When we think about equity and access... (we make) sure that how we communicate home is done in a way that is culturally responsive to the families and ... accurate and true and consistent,"" Vang-Vue said. ""I truly believe that no matter what language you speak or what culture you're from, you need to have all of the information so you can make an informed decision.""
Her said the district needs to do a better job for its Asian families going forward.
""Hmong parents, Asian American parents, we're here long enough, we're standing on our own two feet now,"" Her said. ""We're going to say pretty soon, 'This school system is not working for our kids.' What I see is these parents are going to say, 'Either you've got to make changes or we're going to make changes for you.'""
Outspokenness grows following Atlanta shooting
The Cap Times spoke with Her, Hong and Vang-Vue before the shooting last week in Atlanta in which a 21-year-old white man killed eight people, six of them Asian women.
Prior to that incident, Her noted a lack of support from community leaders and public bodies over the past year as Asians faced discrimination, and racist incidents were fueled by incendiary rhetoric like former President Donald Trump calling the coronavirus the ""Chinese virus.""
""These hate crimes will take place, and elected officials and other folks aren't really taking it as severe enough that it warrants some type of resolution or action,"" Her said.
Hong said racism against Asians ""continues to manifest in a lot of communities."" Though it became ""less blatant"" in her life as she grew up into high school, she said it's important for families to continue anti-discrimination conversations, and schools need to ""prioritize anti-racist curriculum.""
""It's incredibly important that community leaders, elected officials, take a strong stance against anti-Asian hate,"" Hong said.

Vigil protests violence against Asians,"Connolly, D.",Others,2021-03-23,"The 31-year-old man named Stone Jiahao Yu carried his nine-month-old son in a harness strapped to his chest as he and his wife joined a big crowd Sunday evening at a vigil at Shelby Farms. Why did he come? ""My hurt. My hurt,"" he said.
He said he had just written a lengthy Facebook post about his experiences facing racism as a Chinese immigrant — in his first days at a university in Saint Louis years ago, his assigned partner in a chemistry class, who was white, refused to work with him and joined another group, he said, leaving him to spend the semester working on his own. ""I feel so hurt,"" said Yu, who's now working in a dental lab and finishing a graduate degree.
He said he faced other incidents of prejudice throughout the years. Then came the shocking killings this month in Georgia, which prompted him to change his Facebook profile to say ""Stand Against Racism - #StopAsianHate."" So he attended the vigil — something he says he wouldn't usually do.
""I'm very conservative with a lot of moral and ethical issues. Usually I don't support people to do any protesting, especially during the pandemic. But this issue really brought my hurt here.""
Many other people apparently felt the same urge to do something: the gathering drew hundreds of people and several high-level elected officials, including Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris and Sheriff Floyd Bonner.
Several organizations put the event together quickly, including the Greater Memphis United Chinese Association and the Korean Association of Memphis.
The effort also had support from a wide range of other groups including Black Lives Matter, Latino Memphis, as well as Muslim and Catholic organizations.
From the podium on a hill above Patriot Lake, speakers expressed both personal pain as well as hope in the power of the American culture, unity and love.
Annie Zhao, a 16-year-old student at White Station High School who recently won the Miss Teen Tennessee USA competition, wore a pageant crown, gown and sash, and spoke of the pain of anti-Asian violence. ""Why do we have to be scared to buy groceries? To go to school? To go to work? Or even just to be in our own skin?""
But she said the gathering was a hopeful sign toward healing, and she finished with a quote from Martin Luther King Jr. ""Hate cannot drive out hate. Only love can do that.""
Georgia shootings prompted
nationwide reaction
On Tuesday a gunman carried out shootings at three different massage parlors in Georgia. One business was in Acworth, which is northwest of Atlanta. The two other businesses were in Atlanta. A total of eight people died.
Six of those killed were women of Asian descent. A white man and a white woman were also killed. A Hispanic man was shot and survived.
A 21-year-old white man named Robert Aaron Long has been arrested.
A police spokesman said the suspect told investigators he had a sex addiction and the crime was related to that, not to anti-Asian racism — however, the police department spokesman who related that statement to the public was criticized for too quickly dismissing the possibility of racial bias as a motive.
The same spokesman, Capt. Jay Baker, also come under criticism for earlier Facebook posts in which he promoted T-shirts that called COVID-19 an ""imported virus from CHY-NA."" He was later removed from the case.
The Georgia shootings highlighted a rise in harassment and violent incidents against Asians in the United States.
Experts have said the violence follows rhetoric from former president Donald Trump and others that blames China for the COVID-19 pandemic.
""When President Trump began and insisted on using the term 'China virus,' we saw that hate speech really led to hate violence,"" Russell Jeung, chair of the Asian American studies department at San Francisco State University, told USA TODAY. ""That sort of political rhetoric and that sort of anti-Asian climate has continued to this day.""
The FBI's crime data for 2020 and 2021 is not yet available. Jeung's organization Stop AAPI Hate released a report that described 2,583 incidents of anti-Asian actions in the United States between March 19, 2020 and Aug. 5, 2020.
Most of the incidents were verbal harassment or shunning of Asians, though 9% involved physical assaults, the report said.
Among the leaders who have condemned violence and harassment against Asians are President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. They met with Georgia state legislators and Asian American and Pacific Islander advocates.
""The conversation we had today with the AAPI leaders, and that we're hearing all across the country is that hate and violence often hide in plain sight,"" Biden said Friday after the meeting. ""It's often met with silence ... but that has to change. Because our silence is complicity. We cannot be complicit.""
This land is your land
The Memphis event closed with singer Sean Pan leading the crowd in a rousing rendition of ""This Land is Your Land.""
The song brought 74-year-old Khunbok Ahn to his feet, dancing. Afterward, he grabbed the microphone and said he's former president of the Korean association here. ""This is not a Korean matter!"" he shouted. ""This is not an Asian matter! This is all races' matter! . . . We are one race, one people under God!""
As people began to walk back to their cars under the setting sun, Bonner, the Sheriff, spoke of next steps. He said he's not currently aware of anti-Asian violence in Memphis, but said he's meeting with local Asian-American leaders on Monday to learn more and build relationships.

"Atlanta spree raises fears in area Asians Valley has escaped serious racial incidents, but community is wary HATE CRIMES","Wojcik, S. M.",Others,2021-03-21,"When Sam Chen was growing up, his immigrant parents from Taiwan were clear about how he should handle any anti-Asian bias he might confront at school or in the community.
Keep your head down and work hard.
""Their mindset was that we were guests in this country,"" Chen said. ""We were to swallow injustices because we have an opportunity to live in a free country.""
Chen, an Allentown-based political analyst, professor and TV host, said he wonders how this attitude has helped make Asian Americans an easier target for those acting out their racism and hate.
""I tell my Asian colleagues and community members that it is incumbent on us to speak,"" Chen said. ""The first step to activism is awareness. We cannot expect our white friends, our Black friends and our Latino friends to have experienced the same things we've experienced.""
Anti-Asian crimes and incidents have spiked across the country over the last year as some leaders, including then-President Donald Trump, used inflammatory language to describe the coronavirus, which started in China. Stop AAPI Hate, a nonprofit social organization tracking incidents of discrimination, hate and xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the U.S., reported 3,795 incidents from March 2020 to February of this year. Incidents ranged from shunning to vandalism to physical violence.
California and New York led the nation with incidents, with 1,691 and 517 respectively, but Pennsylvania ranked fifth with 
97 reported incidents. According to U.S. Census data, the Lehigh Valley's Asian population stands at a little over 3%. Within that population are dozens of different ethnicities, many with their own languages and customs.
But though headlines across the country have kept them tense and vigilant, Asian American business owners and community leaders in the Lehigh Valley say they've felt fortunate to escape the wave of anti-Asian incidents and crimes.
But this doesn't mean these things don't happen, according to Mohan Seshadri, co-executive director for Pennsylvania's Asian Pacific Islander Political Alliance. Historically, incidents like these are woefully underreported, he said, with issues like language barriers creating enormous hurdles.
Some of the most harrowing incidents of anti-Asian crime have happened this year. Recent headlines include a New York City stabbing and a brutal robbery and beating in Oakland, California.
But the most horrifying incident so far is the March 16 shooting spree at Atlanta-area spas where eight people, six of Asian descent, were killed. Police have been criticized for reporting that alleged shooter Robert Long's claim that he lacked a racial motivation could absolve him of hate crimes.
Racism directed at Asian people is nothing new in America, Seshadri said, but the rhetoric around COVID-19 created a convenient new scapegoat.
""The pandemic created this emotional response, and then to point those folks who are fired up at Asians, it was just going to lead to violence,"" he said. ""This was a very simple equation that I don't think anyone should have been surprised about.""
Bryan Lu, of Bethlehem, is the son of Rakkii Ramen chef and founder Marco Lu, and he helps his father run the family's expanding Japanese noodle house business. Last March, when Lu heard Trump beginning to refer to COVID-19 as ""the Chinese virus"" and ""kung flu,"" he didn't think much of it.
""I didn't think people would take it literally,"" he said.
But it became clear that many did. Fortunately, Lu said, he spent most of the time reading about incidents elsewhere rather than seeing them play out in his own community.
""We're just thankful it didn't happen here,"" he said.
Lobynn Cha, owner of Little Miss Korea in the Allentown Fairground Farmers Market, said she and her family arrived in the U.S. when she was 9 and were quick to immerse themselves into the culture. She suspects her fluent English saves her from potential harassment, and though she's felt safe in the Valley, the recent attacks have her feeling less secure.
""I'm more vigilant these days for sure,"" Cha said. ""I wish people would see that we're all humans. We all came here from somewhere or another and we're all scared of COVID together.""
For some, a sense of exasperation at years of turning the other cheek has set in. Jay Ho grew up in the Lehigh Valley and has taken over the family business, Ho Ho Incorporated, which includes Hunan Springs restaurant in Lower Macungie Township. He now spends most days at his new South Philadelphia restaurant Mei Mei, where he finds the camaraderie of other Asian restaurateurs refreshing.
""I know my parents didn't want any kind of altercation, but now it feels like we're easy targets,"" said Ho. ""There is a generational change with that mentality. We live here. We're as entitled to be here as anyone else.""
Ho said Philly's support network of Asian neighborhoods is a far cry from the feeling of isolation he was accustomed to in the Lehigh Valley, where Asian Americans are scattered throughout the region.
Mark Cho, senior pastor at the Korean Church of the Lehigh Valley in Whitehall Township, tries to combat that sense of isolation among his congregation, encouraging them to reach out to one another.
""I preach and remind them, you are not alone,"" Cho said. ""We are in this together.""
Cho said he encourages his parishioners to report incidents of anti-Asian bias, violence or vandalism to him if they do not feel comfortable turning to police. He's been relieved so far to see that it's not been a local problem, but Atlanta's violence has him bracing in a new way.
He hopes that people outside of the Asian community can understand how unsettling these incidents have been for so many.
""If your neighbor fears for their safety, that is not a good community,"" Cho said.
The solution to that, Chen believes, is the community rallying behind its Asian neighbors. A ""chorus of non-Asian voices"" calling out bad behavior or supporting someone who's been a victim could create the kind of atmosphere that stifles such racism.
Seshadri also believes that grassroots change rather than additional policing is the way forward. Education about the history of anti-Asian hate and discrimination can create a foundation, but action in the form of community support and investment will be the key, he said. The need for better housing and health care for the most vulnerable populations of Asian Americans and immigrant communities are essential issues that make fewer headlines than hate crimes, he said.
""We're Asian from sunup to sundown, and there are so many other pieces, besides hate crimes, that need to be dealt with,"" Seshadri said. ""But more than anything else we cannot let this be just a flash in the pan, otherwise more things like what happened in Atlanta, are going to keep happening again.""

Taking action; Organizer of walk describes experiencing racism towards Edmonton's Asian community,"Labine, J. ",Others,2021-03-28,"Serena Mah has experienced firsthand how racism towards Edmonton's Asian community has worsened since the start of the COVID-19pandemic.
The former broadcast journalist turned communications specialist said last year someone spat on her then 12-year-old son while at a skateboard park and called him a derogatoryname. During a storytelling workshop, she shared that story and began to chokeup.
""I literally was standing up there with my heart in my throat,"" Mahsaid. ""Being in front of people isn't new to me but being in front of people almost in tears about something so personal is new and it hitme. It was really hitting close tohome.""
The issue of racism in North America was once again brought to the forefront following a mass shooting at an Atlanta spa on March 16 that left six Asian American womendead.
The Asian community isn't the only one being targeted byviolence. Recently, several Black and Muslim women have been attacked in Edmonton, with one of the first reported inDecember.
In an act of solidarity, antihate and anti-racism walks were held Saturday across communities including one in Edmonton, which went from Wong's Benevolent Association on 96 Street to ChurchillSquare. Hundreds marched holding signs saying 'Stop Hate', 'We All Deserve to be Safe'and 'Hate is a Virus.' Speakers shared stories about being harassed daily because of the colour of theirskin.
Most people who attended wore masks and organizers reminded participants to maintain six feet of physical distance in order to follow public healthorders.
Mah said many incidents gounder-reported.
""There's mistrust of the authorities,"" Mahsaid. ""There's also this myth... of the modelminority. It's the stereotype that's used against Asians saying they're hard workers, put your head down and don't maketrouble. It sounds like a good stereotype but it'snot. It's used against Asian communities alot.""
Since the start of the pandemic, 1,150 cases of racist attacks were reported across Canada, according to a March 23 survey by the Chinese Canadian National Council TorontoChapter.
While the majority of these cases took place in Ontario and British Columbia, 11 per cent of all reported incidents involved violence or unwanted physical contact, the surveysaid. About 10 per cent of cases involved someone being coughed at or spaton.
Mah said what needs to happen now is for political leaders to step up and take action.
""When you have past administrations at the highest level calling it 'Kung Flu'and being extremely racist that creates a hateful environment,"" shesaid. ""We need our leaders tolead. We need our leaders to speak up and we need our leaders to create an environment that is safe foreveryone.""

Asian man is attacked on Lower E. Side,"Thomas, T.",Others,2021-03-04,"A 56-year-old Asian man was pummeled by a stranger during an unprovoked attack on the Lower East Side,
officials said Wednesday.
The Tuesday night beatdown was the latest in a series of random attacks on Asian-Americans across the city.
The victim, Teoh Ming, of Brooklyn, was approaching the East Broadway subway station near Rutgers St. when
his attacker stormed up and punched him about 8:50 p.m., knocking him to the ground.
Ming, a Malaysian immigrant of Chinese descent, said he's lived in the city for more than 20 years, and he still
likes New York City.
""This is something I can't understand. I don't know what happened. I was going down the steps and he was
coming up,"" he said.
""He hit me three times,"" he said, pointing to his black left eye and his cut lip.
""And the rest, I don't remember anything after that. I fell down and I don't know what happened next.""
The battered victim did not know the man or have any interaction with him before he was attacked, police said.
Ming said he was on his way home from his construction job in Chinatown when he was attacked. He doesn't know if the violence was a hate crime, he said.
""I'm an Asian man in Chinatown and he attacked me. I don't know why he wanted to punch me. He didn't say
anything,"" he said.
The suspect was described as Black and in his 30s and was wearing a gray coat. He ran off and had not been
caught.
The NYPD hate crimes unit was investigating the attack, police said.
The assault comes during a wave of anti-Asian violence advocates say is fueled by racism and ignorance about
the COVID-19 pandemic.

included an incident at the square near Manhattan Federal Court last Thursday where a stranger stabbed a 36-

"Fear, Cultural Mores Keep Many Asian Americans Silent Following Atlanta Murders","Harris, H. R. ",Others,2021-03-30,"Nation Confronts Recent Rise in Attacks Against Asian Americans and Pacific IslandersFor some Americans, the shocking attacks and murders over a week ago by a white man in Atlanta that took the lives of eight people, six of them Asian women, provide further credence for more stringent gun control laws in the U.S. despite objections from those who point to the Second Amendment.But even before the March 16 shootings at three massage parlors in the Atlanta area, many who identify as Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders [AAPI] had already become aware of and concerned about an increase in ""hate crimes"" in which they or others from their community had been victims.Some assert that the rise in attacks, whether physical or verbal, began to escalate after former President Trump took office. Not only did Trump refer to COVID-19 as the ""Chinese virus"" or the ""Wuhan flu"" and support anti-Asian hashtags but the Biden Administration says his ""damaging rhetoric"" both fueled anti-Asian discrimination and ""elevated threats"" to the community.Meanwhile, retail corridors around the D.C. region have been promised greater police protection and surveillance in efforts by law enforcement to keep those who own or frequent the local restaurants, hair and beauty outlets and nail salons free from attacks. Many of these businesses are owned or operated by members of the AAPI community.At the House of China, a Chinese restaurant in Riverdale, Md., when one female clerk was asked to share her views about the recent shootings in Atlanta, she ignored this reporter and continued to take food orders. However, she did briefly say, ""I don't speak English.""But another person at the restaurant, unwilling to share their name, said that in recent months, he's experienced frequent harassment by local police leading him to wonder, ""What should I do?""But rather than lay the blame at Trump's feet, consider the data compiled by national coalitions like Stop AAPI Hate, an organization which addresses anti-Asian discrimination among its goals as cited in a report March 23 in The Washington Post.According to the organization, 3,795 self-reported incidents were filed by AAPIs between March 19, 2020 and Feb. 28, 2021 in the U.S. The incidents, which ranged from name-calling and verbal assaults to physical altercations like being punched, kicked or spit upon, have inevitably been underreported, experts say. Those familiar with the AAPI community point to cultural mores which influence their members to often remain silent rather than speaking out about such violations.""Unfortunately, the reality is Asian Americans are now scared to go outside,"" said John Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, a D.C.-based nonprofit. ""You have community members who are literally thinking about whether they should appear in public at all.""But one local politician said he refuses to be silent including Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan who met with local Asian business owners, along with his wife, Yumi, an immigrant from Korea, in Howard County on Monday, March 22.The Hogans, along with Howard County Executive Calvin Ball, toured Asian-owned businesses that are part of ""Korean Way"" - a state-designated five-mile stretch along Route 40 that serves as home for about 166 Korean businesses.One day earlier, Hogan said on CNN that he has witnessed the effects of discrimination against Asian Americans escalate during the coronavirus pandemic. He referred to the recent murders in Atlanta as ""outrageous"" and ""unacceptable.""In the District, Ben de Guzman, Director of the Mayor's Office on Asian and Pacific Islander Affairs, issued a statement strongly condemning the March 16 shootings ""and the senseless murder of eight people, including six Asian-American women.""And in social media posts immediately after the attacks and then later during a press briefing, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser reaffirmed the city's commitment to opposing violence against the AAPI community throughout the District.""Our office is connecting with District residents, business owners, city agencies, law enforcement, organizations, our government, and our colleagues around the country towards a common cause,"" she said. ""We know that the attacks against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are a national phenomenon. Here in the nation's capital, we are committed to addressing anti-Asian violence, racism and xenophobia.""My wife, my three daughters and my grandkids are all Asian, and they - they have felt some discrimination personally,"" he said. ""We feel it personally with my daughter, who is sometimes afraid to come to visit us, with people who had best friends that were being harassed at the grocery store, or being called names and people yelling about the China virus, even though they're from Korea and born in America.""WI Editor D. Kevin McNeir contributed to this report.

Leaders condemn hatred toward Asian Americans,"Garfield, A.",Others,2021-03-28,"WAUSAU – After last week's Georgia shooting, which took the lives of eight people — including six women of Asian descent — and stirred considerable outrage and fear in the Asian American community, local leaders are condemning racism closer to home.
Wausau Mayor Katie Rosenberg and Marathon County Board member Yee Leng Xiong released a statement Wednesday condemning race-based hatred and asking residents to ""stand firmly and unflinchingly against all forms of hatred.""
""Harassment, bullying and trolling have no home here in Wausau and Marathon County,"" Rosenberg said in the statement. ""I'm especially concerned about the social media conversation I am seeing that seems to devalue Asian women's lives. Every person in our community deserves to be treated with dignity.""
Xiong, who also serves on the Weston Village Board, said he's heard a handful of stories of bigotry, racism and xenophobia toward the Asian American community through his work in local government and the Hmong American Center.
""This is nothing new. It's been going on since last year when the pandemic began,"" Xiong said.
There have been 3,800 reported hate incidents committed against people who identify as Asian American and/or Pacific Islander (sometimes abbreviated as AAPI) across the United States since the COVID-19 pandemic began last March, according to the statement. Xiong said that's almost a 150% increase from previous years.
The number came from research reporting forum Stop AAPI Hate released March 16. Women made up a far higher share of the reports at 68%, compared to men, who made up 29% of respondents. The nonprofit does not report incidents to police.
And while that number is for the entire country, both Rosenberg and Xiong expressed concern about local incidents.
""Am I concerned about that happening in Marathon County? Definitely,"" Xiong said. ""I'm worried about something extreme happening if we don't condemn this behavior.""
The statement detailed anecdotes shared with Xiong, in which Asian American residents of the county were verbally assaulted with racial slurs and told they don't belong in the community. Even though xenophobia and racism were around before the pandemic, Xiong said he has seen ""sheer aggressiveness and sheer directness"" in the past year.
As a result, many members of the Hmong and Asian communities fear for their safety — not just of verbal lashings but retaliation and physical attacks, too, Xiong said. Asian residents are afraid to go shopping or walk to the public garden at night, he said. They walk in groups in public spaces and move quickly at gas stations.
""The fear is very real,"" Xiong said.
Rosenberg said she's concerned anytime someone in the community feels unsafe or unwelcome, which prompted her to put out the statement. She said it's only a starting point, though. She and Xiong are still figuring out what the follow-up looks like.
""There are people who are scared,"" Rosenberg said. ""It's important that everyone here takes a deep breath and stands against that. I think we can get through this.""
The two will work with the City Council and County Board to recommend policies that protect residents and ensure marginalized populations are specifically safeguarded from race-based attacks. In the meantime, they encourage residents to speak up and call out any racist comments or incidents.
Xiong said it makes all the difference to know others are not being bystanders and ""have the AAPI community's back."" Both Xiong and Rosenberg ask local residents and leaders to follow recommendations from AAPI Coalition of Wisconsin by:
Publicly condemning racist language and the racist association between the coronavirus and the Asian community.
Urging media to cover anti-Asian violence to help bring awareness.
Encouraging the reporting of hate incidents, as many go unreported and hinder the ability to appropriately track, allocate resources and address the root cause.
However, their statement has already caused complaints among residents who don't believe discrimination or racism exists in the community. It's a struggle Xiong knows well; it's the same battle he's fighting with the county's ""A Community For All"" resolution.
The resolution, drafted by the Diversity Affairs Commission, seeks to acknowledge racial disparities and discrimination in the community. The measure is a starting point for change and doesn't take any action but has gone through several revisions because of pushback from people who say racism doesn't exist in the county and label it as divisive.
""For people to say it doesn't exist, they are extremely wrong,"" Xiong said. ""I hope those individuals will reach out and listen to (our) concerns and fears and what the (Asian American community) has to say.""
Rosenberg said a good step forward is to open a dialogue about these incidents, potentially through listening sessions. She said it can't just be once, it has to be continual.
""We need to make opportunities for people to be heard and share their stories and make it easier for people to participate in the process,"" Rosenberg said. ""We need to figure out how we listen better.""

"Hundreds, including officials, community leaders rally to show support for Asian Americans",None,Others,2021-03-18,"New York, March 18 -- Local officials and community leaders led by Nassau County Legislator JoshuaLafazan(I-Woodbury) attended a ""Stand Up to Hate"" rally with hundreds of people to condemn increases in bias incidents and violence against Asian-Americans in the age of COVID-19 last weekend.
Lafazan'soffice coordinated the event, held on the front steps of the Theodore Roosevelt Executive and Legislative Building on Sunday, with Gordon Zhang, president of the Long Island Chinese American Association, and FarrahMozawalla, executive director of Nassau County's Office of Asian American Affairs.
""It's on all of us to speak out in a loud, unified, and categorical voice to demand an end to this violence,""Lafazansaid during the rally. ""We know that we cannot drive out hatred with more hate. As Dr. King taught us many years ago, only love can do that. Which is why when you look at this crowd - and you see Muslims, Christians, Buddhists and Jews standing together - when you see people of all different races and backgrounds standing together, when you see people of all different ages standing together, there can be no mistaking that love and unity is the answer.""
""We stand with our brothers and sisters. As Asian-Americans, we are all in this together,""Mozawallasaid. ""No one should be made to feel unsafe, uncomfortable or feel like they do not belong. It is important for us to reiterate that Nassau County is diverse and inclusive.""
The rally was attended by elected leaders, including Nassau County Executive Laura Curran, New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, U.S. Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-Glen Cove), multiple members of the New York Senate and Assembly, North Hempstead Town Clerk Wayne Wink and Nassau County Legislator Ellen W. Birnbaum (D-Great Neck).
Community leaders like Tracey Edwards, Long Island regional director of the NAACP; Dr. Isma Chaudhry, spokesperson and past president of the Islamic Center of Long Island; Eric Post, Long Island regional director of the American Jewish Committee; Andrea Bolender, chair of the board of the Holocaust Memorial and Tolerance Center of Nassau County; and Dr. Asiah Mason, CEO of the Mill Neck Family of Organizations, which provided American Sign Language interpreters for the event; also spoke.
""The steady stream of hateful rhetoric linking Asian-Americans with COVID-19 and the ensuing number of anti-Asian hate crimes is abhorrent,"" Suozzi said. ""It is incumbent upon all of us to do everything in our power to call out and reject xenophobia and racism each and every time it rears its ugly head. We must always ensure that hate will never win.""
""The recent wave of hate crimes across the country, particularly against the Asian-American community, must stop,"" DiNapoli said. ""We must speak out against any form of hate and discrimination directed toward our fellow Americans and New Yorkers. Our neighbors must know we have their backs, and we won't tolerate any violence or threats of violence or intimidation against anyone.""

America's anti-Chinese bigotry has a very old stench,"Hsu, H. L.",Others,2021-03-06,"Since the early months of COVID-19, people assumed to be Chinese have been stared at, yelled at, coughed on,
spit on, sprayed with Febreze, beaten, splashed with acid, pushed, stabbed, and murdered — for wearing
masks, for not wearing masks, for coughing, for sneezing, and sometimes for simply occupying public space. I
have thought twice about spending time in public on days when allergies to cats, pollen, or wildfire smoke might
make me susceptible to the hazards of ""coughing while Asian."" The anti-Asian violence was spurred on by
widespread rhetoric projecting blame for the COVID-19 pandemic onto China and people of Asian descent. But
the stigmatization of Chinese immigrants as a threat to public health and safety has a long history in the United
States. It emerges from an entrenched mode of racism that targets not only Chinese bodies, but Chinese air.
What do I mean by ""Chinese air""?
Answering that requires returning to the epidemic of violence that swept the West after Chinese immigrants
began settling in the U.S. in the 19th century. White Americans refused to live in proximity with Chinese
settlements — literally, they refused to breathe the same air. The consequences were deadly. A mob massacred
19 Chinese men in Los Angeles in 1871, and anti-Chinese race riots erupted in cities such as San Francisco,
Vancouver, and Seattle. Living on the periphery was no protection. As urban travelers in the West rode railroads
built by Chinese migrants to take in the pure air of nature resorts, more than 100 violent purges forced Chinese
immigrants out of rural settlements and into overcrowded, poorly ventilated accommodations in urban
Chinatowns.
At the time, many scientists didn't understand that microbes spread disease. Instead, they believed that illness was transmitted through poisonous air or miasma and endorsed changes to urban planning and sanitation in
their efforts to sustain public health. Anti-Chinese agitators quickly adapted miasma theory as a tool in their
campaign.
Even after germ theory gained acceptance in the 1880s, they stigmatized Chinese air and smells, associating
overcrowded spaces, laboring bodies, opium smoke, culinary odors, and incense in several urban Chinatowns
with disease.
As the historian Nayan Shah has documented, 19th-century San Francisco public health officials regularly
blamed Chinatown for the city's recurring outbreaks of diseases including smallpox, tuberculosis, cholera, and
bubonic plague.
In response to the 1868 smallpox epidemic and working-class agitation against the Chinese, the city's Board of
Supervisors passed the Cubic Air Ordinance in 1870, requiring that dwellings contain at least 500 ""cubic feet of
air"" per adult resident.
This law was enforced exclusively against Chinese people, and critics noted that the city detained Chinese
immigrants in jails that were much more overcrowded than their homes. The Cubic Air Ordinance thus targeted
Chinese people not only as foreign bodies, but as deviant assemblages of bodies and air.
Sanitation became a common pretext for disciplining and displacing Chinese residents. In 1903, the physician
Woods Hutchinson praised San Francisco's health officials for adopting aggressive cleaning methods: ""The seven
and thirty separate smells of Chinatown have all been drowned in one grand olfactory delirium of chloride of
lime and carbolic acid. Never was Chinatown so free from vermin.""
Nevertheless, Hutchinson went on to declare that Chinatown ""can never be cleaned except by fire."" He may
have had in mind a fire that burned down 4,000 homes in Honolulu's Chinatown, permanently displacing many
residents — a conflagration that started when Honolulu's Board of Health burned down buildings to control an
outbreak of bubonic plague.
Hutchinson's fantasy for San Francisco nearly came true in 1906. In the wake of the city's devastating
earthquake and fire, officials proposed relocating its Chinese community from the burned-out but centrally
located Chinatown to far-flung Hunter's Point. This plan, which was eventually stopped after intervention from
China's consul-general, presumed that the Chinese community would not be out of place amid the latter
neighborhood's slaughterhouses and industrial fumes.
On a smaller scale, American nuisance charges have also posited Chinese air as an offense to public well-being.
In the 1880s, complaints about the smell of drying squid shut down a thriving Chinese community of squid
fishermen in Monterey, California. More recently, similar protests have been lodged against Asian restaurants
and food manufacturers, including the Sriracha sauce factory in Irwindale, California.
In a 1999 case in Pennsylvania, grease smells from Wok's Chinese Restaurant were deemed ""noxious"" even
though, the defendant noted, they were comparable to the smell of burning wood from a nearby pizza
restaurant.
The notion of Chinese miasmas has had support from respected academics. In the 1890 essay ""Mongolianism in
America,"" the historian and ethnologist Hubert Howe Bancroft (for whom UC Berkeley's Bancroft Library is
named) wrote that he found it difficult to breathe when he walked through the crowded alleys of San Francisco's
Chinatown. ""Faces swarm at every door, inhaling poison, exhaling worse,"" he claimed. Bancroft never considered
that he might be experiencing anxiety, triggered by his own discomfort with something unfamiliar.
Instead, he speculated ""whether a Chinaman's lungs are not formed on a different principle from ours ... He
certainly seems to thrive in stench where others would suffocate."" Attributing Chinatown's poor air quality to
cultural and biological differences, so-called experts like Bancroft drew attention away from the forces of mob
violence, poverty, social marginalization, and housing inequity that had pushed Chinese immigrants into
substandard living conditions.
Because culture plays a powerful role in shaping olfactory responses, I have been studying how American
narratives spread — and sometimes challenge — these ideas about Chinese air. Stories about Chinese stench
date back to the first decades of Chinese immigration. In the 1860s, Mark Twain wrote about a San Francisco
detective who could smell a chicken feather from a crime scene and ""tell which block in Sacramento street the
Chinaman lives in who committed it.""
The Yellow Peril has a smell in Frank Norris's novel Moran of the Lady Letty, in which a white woman is held
captive by a crew of reeking Chinese pirates. In Sax Rohmer's The Insidious Fu Manchu, published in 1913,
the first Asiatic supervillain attacks detectives with a mysterious poison gas, which leaves ""no clew-remaining
— except the smell."" By the time Raymond Chandler wrote that a character ""had a sort of dry musty smell,
like a fairly clean Chinaman,"" ""Chinese"" had become a metaphor for stench.
Edith Maude Eaton, a mixed-race Canadian writer of the late 19th and early 20th centuries who has been
called the mother of Asian American literature, fought this pattern of olfactory stereotyping in her stories
about domestic life in several urban Chinatowns. Writing under the pen-name Sui Sin Far (""Chinese water
flower"") and titling her book Mrs. Spring Fragrance, she associated Chinese immigrants with pleasant smells.
When they could afford to, Eaton suggested, Chinese immigrants preferred a cool and fragrant atmosphere:
""After the heat and dust and unsavoriness of the highways and byways of Chinatown, the young reporter who
had been sent to find a story, had stepped across the threshold of a cool, deep room, fragrant with the odor
of dried lilies and sandalwood, and found Pan.""
Where the natural aromas of lilies and sandalwood indicate the careful housekeeping of the Chinese family,
the smell of the streets was the result of the city's failure — or refusal — to fulfill its responsibility of cleaning
Chinatown's streets.
The contemporary artist Anicka Yi took a more direct approach to olfactory racism in her 2017 Guggenheim
Museum exhibition, Life is Cheap. The first installation consisted of three gas canisters emitting a blend of
odors sourced from both a colony of ants and from Manhattan's Chinatown and Koreatown.
The main gallery featured two dioramas Yi created by using visually captivating bacterial cultures sourced
from the same neighborhoods, and the same colony of ants inhabiting an enlarged circuit board. The piece is
a meditation on Asian stereotypes and Western dependence on inexpensive Asian imports.
Not unlike Fu Manchu's gas attack, the scents Yi works with — which she describes as vegetal, floral, citrusy,
and meaty — insidiously penetrate the bodies of visitors. But the museum setting recasts the smells of Asian
neighborhoods as an unusual olfactory experience, something to be sought after rather than avoided. Yi hints
that inhaling the scents of Chinatown, Koreatown, and ants might predispose her audience to perceive their
connections with the beautiful forms presented in her living dioramas.
Life is Cheap asks how smells usually thought of as foreign are already part of us, whether as bacteria
inhabiting our bodies or as fumes emitted in the course of producing our computers and phones. After all,
China's industry and urban development are intimately connected with the U.S. addiction to cheap
technology.
And, like the perceived unsavoriness of Chinatown streets, the conditions that promote COVID-19 are part of
something much bigger than a wet market in Wuhan. Chinese air is not made in China, it is an exhalation of
the global economy.

'I AM NOT A FOREIGNER HERE': CITY,"Kim, Y.",Others,2021-03-24,"Hundreds of people marched and chanted through downtown Madison on Thursday, condemning racism against Asians two days after a shooting in Georgia that left eight people, including six Asian women, dead.
The rally, organized by local activists and the University of Wisconsin-Madison's BIPOC Coalition, started outside Madison City Hall. Brenda Yang, a Hmong woman who works at Madison East High School and the Hmong Institute, welcomed the audience, encouraging young students to resist the ""model minority"" Asian myth and come together across ethnic lines.
""Through my work I've been invited to the room. I've been invited to the table,"" said Yang, who has lived in Madison for over 20 years. ""But I've never felt like my voice was heard, seen or important. I always felt like token representation.""
On March 16, a 21-year-old white man shot employees and customers at three Asian-owned massage businesses in Cherokee County and Atlanta, two of which he reportedly frequented as a customer for sex. He has been charged with eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault and is currently being held at the Cherokee County jail in Georgia.
Yang criticized the response by law enforcement officials, who have yet to label the crimes as racially motivated. They have named the Cherokee County victims, two white and two Asian: Delaina Ashley Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Tan and Daoyou Feng.
Korean news outlets and South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs have reported that the four women killed in Atlanta were Korean. Soon Chung Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim and Yong Ae Yue were identified Friday by the Fulton County Medical Examiner's office, according to news reports.
""Racism is not something new to Asians. We have felt its sting since the inception of this country,"" Yang said. ""So words like, 'It was not a racial attack,' only continue to undermine our existence and (perpetuate) the narrative that we are perpetual foreigners. I tell you: I am not a foreigner here.""
UW-Madison administrators said in a statement that they are ""disheartened by the tragic loss of lives.""
""Such hatred and fear connect to a long and terrible history of anti-Asian violence in this country that is unknown to most Americans,"" the statement said. ""We mourn for the victims of last night's attack and call on our campus community to stand in solidarity with our Asian and APIDA (Asian, Pacific Islander and Desi American) communities.""
The crowd marched through the streets downtown. As protest leaders chanted, ""When Asian rights are under attack, what do we do?"" attendees responded, ""Stand up, fight back!""
They gathered at the Capitol building, where Madison Rep. Francesca Hong said the shooting was an act of racial terrorism. Hong, the state's first Asian American representative, encouraged people to hold politicians to high standards and called for the decriminalization of sex work.
""We seem to meet here all too often. We seem to come here whenever there is tragedy and we are forever connected by grief,"" said Hong, who represents the 76th district. ""Call out your elected officials. Make them make a statement and make sure it's about more than just a statement, because it's not just about solidarity; it's about finding solutions.""
President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris Friday visited with community leaders and lawmakers in the Asian American and Pacific Islander community in Atlanta. On Thursday Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives held a hearing on anti-Asian discrimination, which had been scheduled prior to the attack.
Tarah Spangler, a BIPOC Coalition organizer, spent much of March 17 in tears, but she said helping plan the rally made her feel like she was doing something for the broader AAPI community beyond her student group.
""It's not often that our voices are uplifted, that you have to hear what we have to say,"" said Tarah Stangler, a BIPOC Coalition organizer who is of mixed Korean descent. ""Hell, we've been screaming about what was going to happen if we allowed the xenophobic and racist rhetoric of the previous administration to continue, and it felt like no one was listening.""
According to data released earlier this month, nearly 3,800 anti-Asian hate incidents were reported to the Stop AAPI Hate reporting center since the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in the United States, with women reporting 2.3 times more incidents than men. Though the increases are startling, Yang said that they are only the ""tip of the iceberg"" and only represent reported incidents.
""The data does not reflect the nuances and complexities of deep cultural undertones connected to the shame and silence Asian women have felt for centuries,"" Yang said.
A study by California State University's Center of Hate and Extremism found that hate crimes against Asian Americans in the country's largest cities jumped by nearly 150% from 2019 to 2020, even as they dropped overall.
Claire Maki, a Chinese American, said that not only the aftermath of the shooting, but the entirety of the pandemic, has felt like an emotional roller coaster.
The days after the shootings were full of anger and rage at Maki's Asian-interest sorority house, which she said represents a wide range of Asian ethnicities and backgrounds. Though she is an adoptee, many of her sorority sisters are the children of immigrants, who may feel particularly affected by the Georgia shootings.
""They came and worked so hard over here only to experience that same hate that they were trying to get away from,"" she said.
""I came from a predominantly white community, so I was never taught that being Asian was anything special,"" Maki said. ""Seeing a lot of people who look like me, who I can identify with, who I can share my similar stories with, is very empowering and makes all of us feel less alone.""
Maki also called on UW-Madison to more vocally hold discussions and offer resources related to anti-Asian discrimination. The burden is too often on people of color, such as the BIPOC Coalition, to host rallies and gatherings, Maki said.
Activists are preparing a statement to call for stronger city and university responses, Stangler said.
""When you say there's a history, people want to know about that history,"" she said in regard to the UW's response. ""But since you didn't talk about it or provide any resources to learn about it, now that falls on the backs of the AAPI community to do that education. And we shouldn't be responsible for that. This should be on the people who are trying to support us.""

Why I fight like hell: Confronting racist mac and cheese in Phila. is just one part of my continual fight against anti-Asian discrimination.,"Ishii, A.",Others,2021-03-01,"I was fighting racist mac and cheese in Philadelphia last week.
Vichar Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thai man, was shoved to his death in Oakland, Calif., on Jan. 28 after recently receiving his first dose of
the COVID-19 vaccine. Christian Hall, a Chinese adoptee, was shot to death in December by Pennsylvania State Police in the Poconos, his
hands up in supplication. These are just two examples from dozens of reports of violence and hate against Asians in America documented
since last March.
Amid all this, I had to fight racist mac and cheese.
Yes, the mac is real. A Roxborough restaurant called housemade mac topped with “Chinese chili garlic sauce” its “COVID Mac,” as CBS
reported last week. Days later, the Mayor’s Commission on Asian Pacific American Affairs, of which I am the treasurer, released a joint
statement with the full suite of the mayor’s commissions and the Office of Immigrant Affairs to disavow racist attacks on Asian Americans,
including but not limited to the menu item. Meanwhile, its creators have since tried to delete it from memory, which is the most telling thing
about it.
In the lede of a Feb. 22 Washington Post article, the attacks on Asian Americans are described as “high profile.” High profile is not the phrase
we use in my family to describe being spat at, hearing slurs yelled at us. Those aren’t the words we use when a Chinese grandmother is
beaten up on the street. High profile isn’t how we describe being deported because we pray to the wrong God or pay too little to be here.
High profile isn’t how we describe being jailed because we don’t speak English, being evicted because we don’t have citizenship. When those
things happen, we don’t call the story high profile. We use words like tragic, hate-filled, frightening. High-profile attacks is a phrase that
happens when we Asian Americans are treated as data, as ingredients. It reduces us to shocking news items that prompt brief hand-wringing
before most coverage moves on. We don’t begin to understand how we are victims of hate by counting how many witnesses we had.
The news this month isn’t that Americans hate Asians. That is not news to us. The news is that others need the news to remind them that
Asians in America deserve to be treated as complete humans. The news is that anti-Asian prejudice runs so deep I have to spend time
fighting racist — yes, racist — mac and cheese that equates an Asian condiment with COVID-19.
I see many Americans are reiterating the history of the exclusion act, internment order, the travel bans, to remind some abstract “us” that
some abstract “America” criminalized participation in the human experiment for Asian immigrants and their descendants. The secret is that
the “us” and the “America” are the same: a popular majority voted for the presidents who signed these orders. Yet, even after so many “high
profile” incidents of hate, America still hasn’t learned its lesson.
Our so-called “minority group” runs full throttle to prove our humanity today. We want everyone else to see all of us. It is a lot of ground to
cover, so let me acknowledge our collective fatigue. We are fighting for our dignity with the same depletion of energy as everyone else. We,
too, are inundated by crowdfunded health-care services and funerals. We, too, are collapsing under the breathless ferocity of working around
the clock. We, too, are making the best of keeping everybody fed, housed, loved, while the world falls apart.
But on top of that, as an Asian American leader in Philadelphia, last week I was fighting mac and cheese.
I take up what may sound like a “silly” fight because this is the complex reality of how we as Asians have to prove our humanity; because the
only rule of engagement that matters now is to fight like hell for every single thing in communities that continue to be devalued. Historically
othered populations like ours have to define microaggressions, while also navigating justice for the murders of our elders.
My hope is not to be perceived as arch or ironic in addressing a fast-food item, or worse, to be perceived as apathetic because I am not
demanding redress for more serious crimes. To speak humbly is dangerous for Asian Americans because the perception of our passivity, of us
as “quiet,” is the greatest lie we’ve ever belied. So let me be clear. The problem is not that we are silent. The problem is that we are not

become high-profile victims when we take our last breaths.",4588
"Consider me an American, not an 'other'",None,Others,2021-03-20,"The Atlanta-area shootings where eight people were killed, including six women of Asian descent, hit close to home for me. At least four victims were of Korean origin. While I was born in this country and I'm proud to be an American, I am half Korean and half Japanese.
It is unclear whether the shooting victims were targeted because of their race. Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said Wednesday that the suspect, Robert Aaron Long, 21, of Woodstock, Georgia, claimed that his actions weren't racially motivated and that he had a sexual addiction.
I find it unsettling, nevertheless, because it comes at a time when anti-Asian sentiment and violence are on the rise in our country. Some blame people who look like me of being responsible for the so-called China virus, more accurately known as the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
In the early months of the pandemic last year, one woman on Facebook, commenting on an article I wrote as business editor of The Daytona Beach News-Journal, told me that I was a nothing who should go back to China.
And I am not the only one.
I recently interviewed a Daytona Beach, Florida, area family that runs a Korean restaurant. They told me they were being similarly harassed on nearly a daily basis, both by people showing up in person to place orders and then refusing to pay for them, as well as those calling them on the phone during their busy dinner rush.
SaeHee Martin, who owns the Chop Chop Korean Restaurant in South Daytona, told me on Wednesday that she was frightened to learn about the Atlanta-area spa shootings: ""I'm afraid. I don't know what some crazy people are going to do.""
When I read the national news reports about anti-Asian hate crimes, most seem to be happening in large cities that have a bigger percentage of Asian Americans. In King County, Washington, for example, where I was born and raised, those of Asian heritage account for nearly 20% of the population, according to the latest Census Bureau statistics.
Here in Volusia County, where Daytona Beach is located, Asians account for 2% of the population.
The Atlanta-area attacks show that anti-Asian hate crimes, if in fact that's what motivated the shooter, can also happen in communities where there are fewer Asians.
In Cherokee County, Georgia, where the first of the three spa shootings occurred, Asians account for 2.1% of the population.
Even some people I consider friends persist in referring to COVID-19 as the China virus. When I confront them about it, I am told, that's where it started. True, but to blame all Asians, or even all Chinese, for the pandemic is flat out wrong. It suggests that we are all alike, as if we were the Borg from ""Star Trek.""
Growing up in a mostly white neighborhood in Seattle, I was constantly told Asians are good in math (not true, for me) and not so good in English or when it came to matters involving creativity and innovation.
For the record, I double majored in English Lit and Journalism with a minor in art. Conversely, I am not skilled in kung fu or any of the martial arts, and I am not particularly adept at using chopsticks, although I try.
Alike, we Asian Americans are not.
And as far as what country I pledge my allegiance to, I am as proud as any of you to be an American.
I have an uncle who fought in World War II in, not against, the United States Army as a member of the highly decorated 442nd infantry unit made up of Japanese Americans. He fought the Germans while one of his brothers was interned in a relocation camp for those of Japanese descent in California.
My wife and I have three sons, all of whom have served in the U.S. military, including one still in the Air Force.
Stop viewing us as ""others."" We are Americans, and we are human beings who don't deserve to be vilified or, as in the apparent case of the Atlanta spa shooter, objectified.
Much less targeted.

Indian American hotel owners shot in Maryland,None,Others,2021-03-14,"New York, March 14 -- Indian Americanhotel owners were shot during an argument with a guest at their New
Eastern Inn in Elkton, Maryland, in the US last week.
Usha and Dilip Patel, both 59, were shot last Friday (5) in the lobby following an argument with a guest,
possibly over payment, reports said.
Originally fromBharthana, Uttar Pradesh in India, Usha died and Dilip was wounded following the tragic incident,
Police said.
The guest Hakeem Evans, 26, of Newark, Delaware, had been staying at the hotel for a couple of days, said Lt.
Lawrence Waldridge with the Elkton Police Department.
According to reports, it is the latest example in a trend of violence toward hotel owners and Asian Americans.
The incident was caught on surveillance video.
At one point, police say, Evans put a gun between a plexiglass partition separating him from thePatelsand fired.
Usha was shot in the chest and Dilip was shot in the hip before the gun apparently jammed.
""Evans is then seen running back to his rented room and moments later, flees the area in a vehicle, which was
occupied by another person who is not identified at this time,"" according to a EPD press release.
""Elkton police arrested Evans a few hours later without incident at the Royal Farms Convenience store.""
Evans has been charged with first degree murder, first degree assault, attempted murder and use of a firearm in
the commission of a felony, according to EPD. He is being held in the Cecil County Detention Center without
bond.
Dilip was taken to Christiana Hospital after the shooting where he remains in stable condition, according to the
EPD.
Both attacks represent an ongoing problem, said Cecil Staton, Asian American Hotel Owners Association
(AAHOA) president and CEO, in a statement on the most recent shooting.
""America's hotel owners are shocked and outraged by this senseless act of violence against two small business
owners doing their jobs,"" Staton said. ""Attacks against hoteliers continue to increase, and this is yet another
horrendous episode of violence against Asian Americans that is plaguing our society. It must stop now.""
Staton said the violence is directly connected to the Covid-19 pandemic.
""The past year placed undue anxiety, pain, and uncertainty on our nation, yet hoteliers continue to welcome
guests into their hotels and their communities,"" he said.
""This crime compounds the anxieties hotel owners face. Every hotelier knows that something like this could
happen to them at any time. Service to others defines the spirit of hospitality, and that is what makes a loss
such as this so tragic.""",2590
Asian Americans in Wisconsin say many ignored discrimination,"Mathew, B. ",Others,2021-03-30,"GREEN BAY - When Pa Lee Moua heard about the tragic shooting spree in the Atlanta area March 16, she quickly began texting and calling friends and family who work in the service industry at bars, retail stores and nail salons in the Fox Valley and her sister in Oshkosh to make sure they were OK.
While she saw news of the shootings unfold hundreds of miles away, she wanted to make sure friends and family were safe in their own communities.
Eight people, six of whom were Asian women, were killed March 16 in shootings at two spas and a massage business in the Atlanta area.
The victims were identified as Soon Chung Park, 74; Hyun Jung Grant, 51; Suncha Kim, 69; Yong Ae Yue, 63; Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Daoyou Feng, 44; and Xiaojie Tan, 49.
Moua, the diversity, equity and inclusion officer for the Appleton Area School District, also sent emails to Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) staff in the district to check in with them and their students to make sure they knew they had an open space to process and grieve following the shootings.
""That's really a key pillar right now. We are hopeful that a lot of people are just checking in with each other,"" she said.
The shootings follow a wave of violence against Asian Americans in the country that jumped with the start of the pandemic, stirred by the racist and xenophobic language used by former President Donald Trump and others to tie the coronavirus to its origin in Wuhan, China.
Many Asian Americans in Wisconsin are still mourning the losses in Atlanta — and speaking out to make sure their voices and concerns about their safety are being heard.
'People overlooked that': Discrimination toward Asian Americans during the pandemic in Wisconsin
Stop AAPI Hate, an advocacy group, reported nearly 3,800 incidents of harassment, discrimination and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from March 2020 to February 2021 nationwide, compared with around 100 incidents in previous years. Women reported hate incidents more than twice as often as men.
Advocates and residents around the country already had been speaking up about the rise in violence after reports of a series of attacks this year against Asian seniors and the killing of 84-year-old Vicha Ratanapakdee in San Francisco.
For Pam Her of Appleton, owner of 4Chi Business Solutions, the deaths drove home a fear she had been protecting her family and AAPI neighbors against since the early days of the pandemic.
Her, like many other Hmong residents in the region, had to find ways to protect herself as the number of reports of discrimination and violence grew during the pandemic. Her's family began traveling only during the day and keeping an eye on family members whenever they stepped outside.
""We did all our shopping, all the things that we need to do during the day and not go shopping at night — shopping in pairs, taking care of our families, our grandparents, our elderly parents, our elderly uncles and aunts, making sure they don't go to a store by themselves,"" Her said. ""If our grandparents or our mothers or fathers are going outside, even beyond our home, just to the garden next to our home, we watch them. We make sure that we are able to see them, that there's a window to protect them.""
Tara Yang has noticed differences in Green Bay, too. She saw a drop in customers at her family's store, Main Oriental Market, when the first cases arrived in the county in March.
Through summer months, business slowed down at their store, and some customers tried to avoid the store.
""We kind of understood and felt that people didn't want to come to the shop as much anymore just because of the fact that we're an Asian store,"" Yang said.
In April, the market's service vans were vandalized with a racist message related to COVID-19, Yang said.
But she noticed racism in other subtle ways, too, like when someone would go out of their way to avoid being around her when she was shopping at another grocery store or when she went to the bank to help her parents apply for a business loan.
The ""model minority myth,"" a stereotype that says all Asian Americans are successful and problem-free, has often hidden racism toward Asian Americans, Her said.
""As the model minority, we have been very invisible and ... even in spaces where we are the leader of those spaces, our voices a lot of times blend in with everything else. We really don't stand out,"" Her said. ""I think that with everything that is happening, the invisibility of the Asian community is coming to the surface now.""
When Her heard about the shootings in Atlanta, one of her biggest fears came true.
""We did not think about our Asian businesses and safety protocols for them because they are a sitting target,"" she said.
Many advocates, including Yang, said it shouldn't have needed to come to this crisis point in Atlanta because people around the country were sounding the alarm much earlier.
""It's sad that we had to wait until people died to take action. Since the start of the pandemic, we've been voicing, 'Hey someone just verbally attacked us. Someone tried to spit on us.' But people overlooked that. That's exactly why we're at where we're at right now, because those little crimes were overlooked,"" Yang said.
It raises a question Her has had to ask over and over: ""Why can't we be seen as Americans and be valued as Asian Americans? Why must we always be stereotyped as a foreigner?""
Sheng L. Riechers, a senior communications specialist for the city of Appleton, noted that there is a broad range of people who identify as Asian Americans, from countries in extremely diverse regions of east Asia, southeast Asia and south Asia.
""As a Hmong American woman and as a Hmong Asian, I just wish that people took the time to learn more about Hmong people and our culture and our history and the reason why we're here in the U.S.,"" Riechers said. ""And just reminding them that the Hmong people, specifically, fought with U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War and that's why we're here. We're here as refugees of the Vietnam War.""
Addressing hate in the long term
Moua said local Hmong leaders have been working with Appleton and Fox Valley leaders to make sure people are checking in on Asian businesses in the area and communicating more with Hmong community leaders.
Green Bay Police Cmdr. Kevin Warych said the police department will start holding community meetings with Asian American residents in Green Bay.
Warych said the police department hasn't received any reports of hate incidents in the city, but Yang noted she has heard about incidents that went unreported.
People rallied at ""Stop Asian hate"" marches and vigils held in Madison and Milwaukee as well as other states against racism, misogyny and xenophobia in the days after the shootings, seeking justice for the victims. Moua said the events are a way to vocalize the struggles so many Asian Americans face.
""Our culture and our community is a very silent community going back to trauma and keeping everything bottled in. We have to change that. We have to use our voice,"" she said.
But everyone can speak out on issues affecting Asian Americans and other marginalized groups, said Thai Xiong, the director of STEM and health and human performance at the Appleton school district and co-chair of N.E.W. Hmong Professionals.
""We are supporting each other because if other communities are willing to stand out with us, then we should be willing to stand up with them as well,"" he said.
Mai J. Lo Lee, diversity director at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay's Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs Office, noted people might make a social media post or correct a stranger's hateful or rude comment on the internet, but the hard part is holding conversations daily about hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
""I've been encouraging allies who identify as non-Asian to really reflect on the deficit that they themselves have as an individual and to be there for organization,"" Lee said.
One way to build support and understanding would be to ensure that young students are taught accurate histories of immigrants and other marginalized groups, Xiong said.
Lee suggested thinking about your excuses for lack of awareness. Take for example: ""Oh, I don't know about historical anti-Asian policies because my school never taught me,"" he said. Historical policies include immigration quotas enacted in 1924 that barred many Asians from immigrating to the U.S.
""Let's look at your current school district,"" Lee said. ""Let's look at curriculum and say, 'Let's not repeat that mistake.' So how can I educate my child, my niece, my nephew, myself on that? You're recognizing, 'I'm holding myself accountable about not knowing about anti-hate history because my school never taught me.' Well then, hold your school accountable. Hold your colleges accountable. This is where alumni voice is very important.""
That same line of thinking can be applied to other parts of your life, Lee said. If you don't know know that many Asian American people in your workplace, question your workplace's hiring practices and policies. If you don't know have that many Asian American neighbors, ask yourself why that is? Is it that there are not many grocery stores and other businesses by and for Asian Americans in your community? How supportive is your community to minority-owned small businesses?
""Something I always challenge my friends and immediate family on: It's almost easier to correct a stranger, but how are you correcting family? How are you correcting colleagues? Your supervisor? The people you train? Because that's really where the work comes in, is that day-to-day,"" Lee said.

'Possible hate crime' against Willamette student: University president condemns harassment of Asian people,"Barreda, V.",Others,2021-03-03,"Authorities are investigating a possible hate crime after a Willamette University student reported being pushed and kicked by two men in
downtown Salem while they allegedly made derogatory comments about her race.
The 21-year-old woman reported she was attacked at about noon Sunday on the corner of Capitol and Chemeketa streets while walking
to Safeway, according to Lt. Treven Upkes, a spokesperson with the Salem Police Department.
On Monday, Willamette University Vice President of Student Affairs and Dean of Students Dr. Lisa Landreman sent an email to the school
community about the incident. ""Today we were horrified to learn about a racially-motivated hate crime involving physical violence and
harassment, targeted at a Willamette student.""
University officials have not identified the student involved. But in the letter, Landreman commented on the rise in violence against Asian
American and Pacific Islander individuals since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""It's important to acknowledge these crimes and for all members of our community to resist ill-informed, biased perspectives about
Asian people and to denounce this violence,"" she said.
The woman was approached by two men and pushed ""while derogatory comments were yelled at the student about their race,""
Landreman wrote.
The student fell to the ground and one of the suspects allegedly kicked her. She suffered minor injuries, officials said.
The student reported the incident to the Salem Police Department and Willamette University Campus Safety.
The first man is described as 5 feet 6 inches tall with a big build, long curly blond hair and facial hair. He was wearing a gray v-neck shirt
and black snow hat.
The second man is described as 5 feet 11 inches tall with a thin build and thin brown hair. He was wearing a button-down shirt and a
snow hat.
The two men could face second-degree bias crime and harassment charges, Upkes said. Police have not made any arrests.
Some politicians, including former President Donald Trump, blamed China for the COVID-19 pandemic, said Russell Jeung, who created a
tool that tracks hate incidents against Asian American Pacific Islander communities called the Stop AAPI Hate tracker.
Since the tracker was started nearly a year ago, more than 2,583 incidents have been reported nationwide. Of those, 30 were in Oregon.
""When President Trump began and insisted on using the term 'China virus,' we saw that hate speech really led to hate violence,"" said
Jeung, chair of the Asian American studies department at San Francisco State University. ""That sort of political rhetoric and that sort of
anti-Asian climate has continued to this day.""
Anyone with more information about the incident is asked to contact the Salem Police Department at 503-588-6123.

Local Asian Americans feel national tensions,"Spata, Christopher",Others,2021-03-25,"Three days after a senseless rampage killed eight people in Georgia, eight staffers from Sparks, a student-run
magazine at the University of South Florida, met virtually to try to make sense of it.
They did not discuss the upcoming issue of their magazine giving voice to the Asian American community that
was the night before. They met to process feelings about the slayings, which included six women of Asian descent,
and happened just as new reports described a rise in anti-Asian hate.
They needed to talk it out with other people who, they knew, would simply get it.
They dont see us as humans, they see us as temptations, said editor in chief
Amy Nguyen, 20, speaking about the so-called sexual addiction that may have motivated the killer. The
temptations were Asian women simply existing.
She remembered times when non-Asian men had asked her if she had any specifically Asian friends they could
date.
These people are the ones who are silent now, she said. You liked Asian women and appreciated us then, but now
youre silent. The group agreed that change would require Asians and non-Asians speaking up.
It highlights how were seen as objects, Dencie Devora, 21, said. She spoke of Japanese characters on T-shirts and
tattoos, and how everyone seems to love Chinese food. Theres appreciation for the culture, but no respect.
Amy Pham, 18, noted how close several of the victims were to her mothers age, and how long it took to get that
information.
There just wasnt much emphasis on them, she said.
Prakash Vasanthakumar, 19, called the shooting domestic terrorism.
They discussed racist jokes theyd let slide at their high schools, their gratitude for finding each other, and
assumptions people made. Someone at USF had recently asked Nguyen, who grew up in Pasco County, if she was
an international student.
That happened to me today! Pham said, laughing.
Clearly it wasnt their Asian-ness that united the diverse group, which included students of Vietnamese, Indian and
Filipino descent. It was the rest of the worlds reaction to it.
Hate crimes vs. racist incidents
The Tampa Bay area has not seen the violence against Asians, especially women and the elderly, that has shaken
communities in larger cities like Los Angeles and New York. But locals are highly aware of it.
Its so scary, said Winnie Tang, the vice president of the Asian American Federation of Florida. Its getting worse.
The hurt keeps getting deeper.
We have friends and family in all those cities, said Man Le, founder of the Tampa chapter of the National
Association of Asian American Professionals and an administrator for the Tampa Hillsborough Expressway
Authority. If it affects someone in Atlanta, it affects someone here.
The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University released a study this month showing
reported hate crimes against Asian Americans rose 149 percent between 2019 and 2020. That was as hate crimes
overall declined.
Another group called Stop AAPI Hate AAPI stands for Asian American and Pacific Islander tallied 3,800 hateful incidents nationwide during the first year of the pandemic.
In a national survey by the Hate Crime Research and Policy Institute at Florida State University, over 30 percent of
Asian respondents indicated they changed their behavior to avoid the possibility of harassment by avoiding
specific locations, being more aware of their surroundings, paying attention to how they speak, being careful about
their appearance and mentally preparing for insults before they come.
You dont have to be a direct victim of a hate crime to be affected by whats going on right now, said Brendan Lantz,
director of the FSU institute. The impact, particularly on mental health, extends so much further beyond being a
victim.
Law enforcement agencies in the Tampa Bay area have not reported an uptick in hate crimes against Asian
Americans. In Florida, its called evidencing prejudice, an add-on charge that increases penalties for crimes
committed against minority groups.
Nationally, a little less than half of Asian respondents to the FSU survey indicated they knew someone personally
who had been a victim of a hate crime.
The most common type of discrimination faced was verbal insults. Those incidents often go untracked since there
isnt a crime to report, and Stop AAPI Hate does not have statistics for Tampa Bay specifically. But some locals
have stories about the past year.
A man stepped out of the shadows and blocked the sidewalk in front of two Asian American women walking near
St. Petersburgs downtown waterfront in February. Video shows him shouting a racial slur at the women, over and
over, even after theyd crossed the street in fear.
Im 32, and this is the first time Id experienced anything like that before in my life, said Amy, a Pinellas County
native who requested her last name be withheld, out of fear she could be harassed online. St. Pete is pretty open,
liberal and friendly. ... When that happened, it felt like it was spreading here.
A Chinese American real estate agent in Tampa said her car was keyed. An Asian American networking group
discussed over Zoom how people now made an effort to not stand near them in the supermarket, even if it meant
waiting in a longer line.
A Greek restaurant on St. Petersburgs Central Avenue apologized publicly after a misogynistic and racist incident
where outdoor diners threw food at a group of Filipino American women in September.
While the pandemic kept him physically distant from the community, Steve Yang, assistant principal at Tampa Bay
Chinese School, saw Tampa friends post videos of racist street harassment. Then his wife, Angela Ren, came
home and said a stranger at Costco in Brandon told her to go back to China.
Its really upsetting. Weve been in the U.S. 30 years, said Yang, 58, whose children were born and raised in Florida.
One starts college in the fall; the other is finishing medical school.
Around the same time the USF students from Sparks honored the victims of the Georgia shootings by reading their
names aloud, Yang and his wife were attending an online vigil over Zoom with thousands of others from around
the country. Yang said that while socially his family connects more with other Chinese Americans, who share a
language and culture, times like this call for solidarity among Asian Americans, as well as non-Asian minorities,
and hopefully, he said, white allies.
He and his wife attended their first Black Lives Matter event last year.
I like what Martin Luther King said, that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, Yang said.
Lantz believes fear is behind the uptick in hate nationwide, stoked in part by the uncertainty of the pandemic and
by political leaders using racist language such as China Virus and Kung Flu.
When a person is more fearful, Lantz said, they tend to identify targets for their fear.
Asian American community?
The fastest-growing ethnic group in Florida is Asian Americans.
People of Asian descent are an estimated 4.4, 3.6 and 2.8 percent of the population in Hillsborough, Pinellas and
Pasco counties, respectively, and many suspect those numbers will be higher when the U.S. Census is released in
April.
But Tampa Bays Asian American community is better described as communities, comprised of more than a dozen
ethnicities. The largest groups across Pinellas, Pasco and Hillsborough are Indians, followed by Vietnamese,
Filipino, Chinese and Koreans.
The geography of Tampa Bays Asian community is less defined and more diffuse than in many large cities, but
there are pockets. The Tampa Korean United Methodist Church in Wesley Chapel grew its congregation into the
hundreds in recent years, and there are multiple Korean-language newspapers available in Tampa Bay.
Lealman and Pinellas Park have the highest percentage of residents of Vietnamese ancestry in the state.
The Lealman Asian Neighborhood Family Center offers services in English, Vietnamese, Hmong, Laotian and
Spanish, and we have a friend who will come in and do Chinese if we need Chinese, said executive director Donna
McGill. Pretty much any services that they dont know how to access, we help them. ... Sometimes they just need to
use the phone, or a computer.
The center offers help with job applications, citizenship and an after-school literacy program for children. Three
people who came through the center became U.S. citizens in a recent week, McGill said.
In the past, our Asian families had not utilized our food pantry, McGill said, but the pandemic changed that. ... If
you owned a restaurant, or a nail salon, as many of our families do, its been hard.
Shes now working on making the center a vaccination site, and partnering with the nearby Holy Martyrs of Vietnam
Parish Catholic church, where for the past two years Mass has been primarily given in Vietnamese.
Loc Nguyen, a board member at the Lealman family center, arrived in Pinellas County over 40 years ago as a
refugee after the Vietnam War. There was a small handful of Vietnamese, he said, but now I think we have over
10,000 in Pinellas.
Nguyen, 66, recently helped organize the installation of a permanent monument honoring Vietnamese and
Americans lost in the war, which now sits at Little Saigon Plaza, a collection of Vietnamese and Korean businesses
off U.S. 19 in Clearwater.
Several dozen Filipino Americans gathered at Tampas Philippine Enrichment Complex on Sunday to dance in the
short film My APA Vision. The director, S. Roy Saringo, is a member of the new Florida nonprofit Asian Pacific
American Scene, Inc., formed to help cultivate Asian American Artists.
If you see a Filipino in Tampa Bay, you probably know them or will see them again, said Arnell Biglete, speaking of
Tampas relatively smaller Filipino community.
He experienced racism when he lived in bigger cities, like Los Angeles, Biglete said, but not in Tampa Bay. Today,
he believes, theres enough exposure to different cultures.
But Brandy Jones-Breth, who grew up in Tampa Bay and whos half Black and half Filipino, worried about her family
after the rise in hate.
The first thing I thought about was my mother, said Jones-Breth, 42.
The disconnect between popular culture recently, and whats happening in the news now, feels head spinning, said
Debbie Crockett, director of the Asian Pacific American Bar Associations Tampa Bay chapter.
Its really cool to be Korean right now, K-pop, K-dramas, everyone wants to eat kimchi and learn Korean and watch
Parasite, she said. Its amazing, and it makes me proud. ... Then youre bombarded with news about our elders being
pushed and shoved in the street. Its weird to me.
A significant number of Asians are leaving large cities over safety concerns and seeking Florida sunshine, said
Realtor Sunny Duann, who works with many such clients in Tampa. The most popular area for Chinese American
home buyers right now, she said, is New Tampa.
I appreciate so far no such crimes have happened here, she said, but with a growing population comes concerns
over growing attention and exposure.
Enrollment at Tampa Bay Chinese School, which teaches language and culture to younger generations of Chinese
Americans, and anyone else who wants to learn, has skyrocketed in the past decade, said Yang, the assistant
principal.
If there is a trait that some Asian American groups have shared historically, Yang said, its a tendency to quietly
focus on their own affairs and avoid making waves.
Its changing now, he said, because everyone is learning that silence is not going to work. If you dont raise your
voice to recognize racism, nothing changes.

"For Asian-Americans, Atlanta Spa Shootings Heighten Worries; Crimes targeting Asian Americans have increased in some cities since beginning of Covid-19 pandemic ","Bauerlein, Valerie",Others,2021-03-19,"In the two days since a gunman killed eight people in the Atlanta area, including six women of Asian descent, groups have gathered in New York City, Seattle and Southern California, with more marches planned for this weekend. Social media has lit up. 
Their common theme: The incident is mobilizing Asian-Americans who have seen their communities victimized by hate crimes over the past year, even if police haven't determined whether the shooting belongs in that category. At vigils, on Twitter and in workplaces, the slayings seemed to resonate with millions of people in a way that many said was reminiscent of George Floyd, a Black man whose death in Minneapolis police custody sparked a summer of unrest and conversations about race in the U.S. 
President Biden ordered flags at federal buildings to be flown at half-staff in honor of the victims and plans to meet with Asian-American leaders in Atlanta on Friday. Many employers were quick to declare their support for racial equity and for Asian-Americans in particular. 
Investigators with the sheriff's office of Cherokee County, site of the spa where the first four people were fatally shot, said Wednesday they had yet to find evidence that the violence was racially motivated. They said 21-year-old suspect Robert Aaron Long told investigators he targeted spas because he blamed them ""for providing an outlet for his addiction to sex."" 
But Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Charles Hampton Jr. said Thursday that his department was considering all possibilities, including whether the fatal shootings at two Atlanta spas were hate crimes. ""We had four Asian females that were killed,"" Mr. Hampton said, referring to the deaths in his jurisdiction. ""Nothing is off the table."" Regardless of whether they are found to be hate crimes, many say the emotional impact has been the same. ""No matter what they claim the motive may have to have been, we know the attacks were on a community that has been targeted in the past,"" said Aisha Yaqoob Mahmood, executive director of the Atlanta-based Asian American Advocacy Fund, a nonprofit. ""No matter how you put it, people will be scared."" 
Several thousand people signed online petitions calling for the firing of Cherokee Sheriff's Office Capt. Jay Baker for saying that Mr. Long was having a ""bad day"" and was at the end of his rope with his sex addiction when he acted. 
""It wasn't a bad day,"" tweeted Georgia state Rep. Bee Nguyen, an Atlanta Democrat. ""It was a brutal and violent crime in which racism, misogyny, gender-based violence and lax gun laws intersect."" Mr. Long bought a 9- millimeter gun hours before the shooting, according to an attorney for the gun store where the purchase was made. 
Capt. Baker didn't respond to requests for comment. Sheriff Frank Reynolds said Capt. Baker's remarks weren't intended to show disrespect for victims or sympathy for Mr. Long. ""We regret any heartache Capt. Baker's words may have caused,"" Sheriff Reynolds said. 
In testimony to the U.S. House Judiciary Committee on Thursday, Rep. Doris Matsui, a Democrat from California, described the killings as ""a horrific reminder of the fear and pain"" many Asian-Americans have felt as violence against them surged since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, which first emerged in China. Anti-Asian hate crimes in Los Angeles, Boston, Seattle and more than a dozen other cities increased 149% in 2020, according to an analysis of preliminary police data by the Center for the Study of Hate &Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. 
A Pew Research Center survey of 9,654 U.S. adults last June found that roughly 31% of Asian adults said they had been the subject of slurs or jokes because of race or ethnicity since the pandemic's beginning, compared with 21% of Black adults, 15% of Hispanic adults and 8% of white adults. 
After the Atlanta spa shootings, law-enforcement officers in New York, Seattle and Atlanta said they were closely monitoring Asian-American communities as a precaution. 
A string of assaults this year in Oakland, Calif.'s Chinatown led authorities to create a special response unit. Professional basketball player Jeremy Lin recently posted on social media that a racial slur was used against him and urged different racial and ethnic groups to overcome division. 
""Look for the Asian people that are scared to walk around in their neighborhood and ask how you can help them,"" he recently posted on Facebook. 
The New York Police Department last fall formed an Asian Hate Crime Task Force, its first-ever task force dedicated to investigating crimes targeting a single race. Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo said it can be very difficult to prove a violent assault or attack was a hate crime because prosecutors must prove the motive. ""It's not hard to prove that they did it, it's hard to prove why they did it,"" he said in an interview Thursday. There is more reluctance for these victims to report the crimes due to cultural standards of not wanting to make trouble, or fear of retaliation, Deputy Inspector Loo said. To encourage people to come forward, ""we do outreach with the community leaders, we put out announcements in local Chinese newspapers, we do videos,"" he said. Some in the Asian-American community say they are thinking about how to practically change racial stereotypes and perceptions and not be mere bystanders. 
""If there's not enough outpouring of anger, this doesn't get the attention and justice it deserves,"" said Helen Li, a 34 year-old program manager at a technology firm in New York City. 
Ms. Li said she has become more vocal with friends and on social media and plans to attend a march on Sunday at Union Square. 
""We are really hoping to take this as a watershed moment where our lawmakers and the broader community will see it for what it is,"" said Azka Mahmood, communications and outreach director for the Georgia chapter of the nonprofit Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR. 
Mr. Long, the suspect in the shootings, is charged with eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault, officials said. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is still assisting local law enforcement. ""If, in the course of the local investigations, information comes to light of a potential federal violation, the FBI is prepared to investigate,"" said Kevin Rowson, a spokesman for the FBI's Atlanta field office. 
The victims at the first spa targeted were Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Xiaojie Tan, 49; and Daoyou Feng, 44. Elcias R. Hernandez-Ortiz, 30, was injured. 
Atlanta police haven't released the names of four victims in the city's two spa shootings because they haven't been able to reach next of kin, Deputy Chief Hampton said. The police were working with Korean diplomatic officials to do so, as several of the women were of Korean descent, he said. 
Calls to two of the spas weren't returned, and the phone number for one was disconnected. ",6947
'Sex addition' may be motive for Atlanta killer: Officials,"Arul, L.",Others,2021-03-17,"New York, March 17 (IANS) The man who killed eight people in shootings at Atlanta massage parlours may have
been impelled by ""sex addiction"", officials said on Wednesday although six of the victims were of Asian descent.
A 21-year-old White man, Robert Aaron Long, is in custody and he has admitted to carrying out the Tuesday
evening shooting at three locations, officials said.
The killings of people of Asian descent came as the country was being swept by a wave of violence against
them.
But Sheriff's Office Captain Jay Baker said at a news conference on Wednesday that two of the victims were
White and that Long ""does claim that it was not racially motivated"".
Sheriff Frank Reynolds said Long ""made indicators that he has some issues, potentially sexual addiction, and
may have frequented some of these places in the past"".
Baker added that Long told them he considered the spas ""as an outlet for him"" to do ""something he shouldn't be
doing"" and that he wanted ""to take out that temptation"".
Seven of those killed were women and the South Korean Foreign Ministry said that four of them were of Korean
descent.
At least one person was also injured in the attack.
Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said: ""Whether it's senseless violence that we've seen play out in our
streets, or more targeted violence like we saw yesterday, a crime against any community is a crime against us
all.""
Fears persisted in the Asian community that they were targeted because of the spate of violence against them.
Vice President Kamala Harris said: ""Knowing the increasing level of hate crime against our Asian American
brothers and sisters, we also want to speak out in solidarity with them and acknowledge that none of us should
ever be silent in the face of any form of hate.""
An organisation, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the US, has said that 3,800 cases of violence and
harassment have taken place in the past year.
Democrats and Asian activists have blamed former President Donald Trump for the violence because of repeated
assertions calling Covid-19 the ""Kungflu"" and an ""Asian virus"", leading some people to blame Asians in the US
for the pandemic.
Officials said that after images of Long were circulated, his family identified him and alerted them enabling them
to track him using his mobile phone.
He was captured without incident about 240 km away. Officials said that he was on his way Floriday and may
have been planning to attack a ""porn"" business.",2465
"From Bad to Worse For Asian Americans: Locals tell of racist encounters, see escalation in Ga. attacks.","McCarthy, E.",Others,2021-03-19,"Stephen Kulp was walking on a Center City street this summer, adjusting his face mask to ensure it covered his nose and mouth, when he was attacked for existing.
“Chinese virus, go back to where you came from!” the man shouted, his voice full of hate.
Near busy Broad and Locust Streets, the stranger then broke away from his group of friends, following Kulp.
“He was throwing extremely racist slurs at me,” Kulp said. “It’s hard to even recount because it was so intense and aggressive.”
The man’s friends eventually pulled him away, cutting off the attack. Kulp ducked into the lobby of an apartment building to collect himself.
It was the second time since last March, when the coronavirus pandemic began, that the 32-year-old had been verbally assaulted while walking by himself in Philadelphia.
The coronavirus “is something that is fueling an anger, fueling a bias, fueling a prejudice that they might already have,” Kulp said. “But I’m sure it has created a whole new population of folks with prejudice and bias toward Asian Americans, Asians in general.”
Across the country, the anger has escalated to violence, spurred by both the pandemic and racist views. On Tuesday evening, shootings at three Asian-owned spas in the Atlanta area left eight dead, including six women of Asian descent. Police on Wednesday afternoon identified some of the victims: Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Xiaojie Tan, 49; and Daoyou Feng, 44; and Paul Andre Michels, 54.Authorities have been criticized for denying that race was a motive in the killings and saying the victims were targeted only for their gender even though Asian women have long been hypersexualized.
“Even though the news is saying they don’t know if it’s ‘hate-related,’ there’s no doubt there’s a connection to the Asian community,” said Alix Webb, executive director of Asian Americans United, a Philadelphia-based advocacy group. “We can’t imagine this isn’t in part a result of what has appeared over the last four years around white supremacy and race-based targeting by the [former] president of the United States.”
Philadelphia Councilmember Helen Gym called the shootings “the latest escalation in the nation’s history of systemic racism and violence against Asian immigrants, fostered by a culture of white supremacy and misogyny that has long devalued the lives of immigrants, Black women, and women of color.”
On Wednesday night, Gym spoke at a vigil for the victims of the Atlanta shootings that was attended by more than 100 people.
In recent months, there have been brutal attacks captured on video in which Asian Americans are beaten, stabbed, or shoved in public, sometimes fatally. Such attacks have claimed the lives of Vicha Ratanapakdee, 84, in San Francisco, and Pak Ho, 75, in Oakland.
In Philadelphia, reports to the city of anti-Asian American hate tripled between 2019 and 2020. People in its Asian communities are shaken and traumatized, constantly on edge, worried they or a loved one could be the next person assaulted or killed while walking on the street or riding the subway or doing their job. Some of the city’s 120,000 Asian residents, particularly those of East and Southeast Asian descent, say they are avoiding taking public transportation, walking alone, or going out at night.
“I think the fear of bias existed at the beginning of the pandemic,” said John Chin, executive director of the Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation, “but these recent episodes have really struck a nerve because watching the videos, they’re so violent.”
As others begin to feel hopeful, excited about increasing vaccinations and loosening restrictions, some in the region’s Asian American communities say they worry about what it will be like for them to return to restaurants, bars, and other public spaces, to be surrounded by even more people who may harbor hatred and feel emboldened to act on it.
“Just like many Americans, we look forward to the opening-up,” said Qunbin Xiong, principal of the Main Line Chinese Culture Center. “But for the Asian American community, the opening-up has become a factor of anxiety, because we don’t know what’s waiting for us.”
Over the last year, nearly 3,800 anti-Asian hate incidents have been reported nationwide, 97 of them in Pennsylvania and 59 in New Jersey, according to research from Stop AAPI Hate, which launched in March 2020 “in response to the alarming escalation in xenophobia and bigotry resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.” In the first two months of 2021 alone, the organization logged 503 incidents nationwide.
Nearly 70% of the national reports were verbal harassment or name-calling, according to Stop AAPI Hate, and many of the assaults are brazen, with 35% happening at a business and 25% occurring on a public street or sidewalk. Of the people who reported being attacked, nearly 70% were women.
In 2020, Philadelphia received 28 reports of acts of hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, a city spokesperson said, compared with eight reported acts in 2019. In the first months of 2021, the city said it has received two reports.
But these numbers tell only part of the story. Stop AAPI Hate says reports represent “only a fraction of the number of hate incidents that actually occur,” and even Kulp, who chairs the Philadelphia LGBTQ Bar Association, did not know bias incidents were reportable when he was harassed.
It is harder to quantify the pervasive anxiety, fear, and trauma that are triggered by the constant barrage of images of Asian violence and by the sounds of hateful rhetoric, which has intensified since former President Donald Trump used racist terms to describe the pandemic.
Statistics also don’t account for the United States’ history of state-sanctioned anti-Asian discrimination, such as the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, which barred Chinese immigrants for decades, and the internment of more than 100,000 Japanese Americans during World War II.Resurfaced trauma
As he reads reports of increased anti-Asian racism from his Berwyn home, A. Hirotoshi Nishikawa, 82, remembers what it was like to be forced into an internment camp as a child. He recalls being a 5- or 6-year-old in the Poston, Ariz., camp’s un-airconditioned barracks, with no running water, on a 115-degree day as he itched all over from chicken pox.
He remembers the metal badges children back home in California wore that identified them as Chinese, not Japanese, “so that people, mainly whites, wouldn’t hassle them,” Nishikawa said. Ironically, he added, it was when he left the camps, where there were few white people, that he realized the extent of the public’s antipathy toward Asian Americans.
“The incarceration experience was somewhat unique,” he said, noting he believes today there are more “reasonable,” antiracist people in government and in society at large. “As we are seeing now in terms of anti-Asian activities, hostilities, people take it on themselves to do bad things, just because they have a mind-set.”
Rob Buscher, the president of the Philadelphia chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League, said this year has been re-traumatizing for Japanese Americans, some of whom still remember being forced to go to mass incarceration camps because the government viewed them as threats to national security during World War II. Others have heard their relatives tell these stories.
“For this community of Japanese Americans, people who have had this experience, they never get over their childhood trauma,” he said. “A moment like this is resurfacing all of that.”
The surge of high-profile violence has exacerbated anxiety about the coronavirus, some Asian Americans say, and worsened their sense of isolation.
Even before the pandemic, Asian Americans faced barriers to mental-health services as they felt pressure to live up to the “model minority” myth, the stereotype that they can beat racism by studying and working harder than other racial groups, said Esther Castillo, the project manager of Chinese Immigrant Families Wellness Initiative under the Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation.
“There essentially is no space for people to talk about these kinds of experiences,” Castillo said. “When you have trauma, you have to address it. So you have to talk about it, you have to express it. And now people just bottle up all these feelings.”
When Castillo, a sociologist, recently reached out to people in Philadelphia’s Asian communities, she found many were struggling alone. The phone calls “devastated” her, she said, so much so that she had to stop for her own mental health. Some people told her they found themselves increasingly paranoid, with one couple sleeping during the day after teenagers rang their doorbell at night.
She can empathize with the fear. Last spring, Castillo said she and her husband were walking their dog in South Philadelphia when a man yelled to them, “Oh, you should take off your mask, because you guys brought the virus here!”‘Unseen in public spaces’
The rise in racism and violence has also worsened longstanding anxiety among Asian Americans about being viewed as a “perpetual foreigner,” who is scapegoated for everything from wars to disease.
Many Asian Americans now “want to be unseen in public spaces,” Buscher said.
Xiong not only stopped taking the train from Delaware County to his job at Penn Medicine, but he also avoids passersby on walks from his car to the office.
“I try not to make eye contact with people,” he said. “I literally do not want to expose my Asian face to them.”
Seeing the news reports about increased violence, “it really chips away at your feeling of safety,” said Djung Tran, a Bucks County lawyer who is on the board of the Asian Pacific American Bar Association of Pennsylvania. “If you encounter this on a regular basis, you’re constantly on alert.”
Asian Americans across the region say they don’t see this anxiety going away anytime soon. Some say they worry about what will happen when society turns its attention to other issues and stops paying attention.
“It is never going to end,” Xiong said. “I predicted a year ago when Trump started doing this. He’s the seed of the hatred. Unfortunately you cannot just cut the plant. … The soil is there.”
In the face of this, however, Castillo said she has been heartened to see the organizing efforts of the Asian American communities’ younger generations.
After the Black Lives Matter movement last summer, they “realized the importance of doing antiracist work within our attempt to show ourselves in the most authentic way, in a way that deviates from the stereotypical model-minority myth, that we are suffering that we are hurting, and we have been hurting,” she said. “It’s just that we never showed ourselves.”

Asian-American women call for action,"Contreras, N. E.",Others,2021-03-20,"""People tend to think that we're fine, that Asians are fine because we tend to stay quiet because we don't speak up as often as others, but we are not OK. We have lived in fear for so long. We love the United States, this is our home but now we don't feel safe.""
Sunny Shuai
Chinese immigrant and longtime Indiana resident
Days before a shooting in Atlanta that left eight people dead, six of them Asian women, Asian-American and Pacific Islander women sounded the alarm in Indiana.
""This is something people need to recognize,"" Ariana Cavallini said.
""These hate incidents, this white supremacy is hurting us. It's happening across the country and it's happening locally to Asian Americans.""
A suspect was arrested and charged with murder and assault after shootings at three Atlanta-area spas on Tuesday.
Local law enforcement stated the suspect has said his alleged actions were not motivated by race, but anti-Asian harassment and hate crimes have surged to more than 3,000 nation-wide in the past year.
The incidents are tied to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and many were violent.
These events have ignited some Asian Hoosiers, many of whom have long felt invisible and not heard, to speak out and advocate on behalf of others in their community about the discrimination and racism Asians are facing and have been facing for years.
And they want Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb to act.
""It's unfortunate that it had to take death and murder,"" Cavallini said, ""for people to start listening to us.""
The 24-year-old Filipino American Hoosier is a member of the Indiana Chapter of the National Asian Pacific Islander Women's Forum (NAPAWF), a group based in Indianapolis and Bloomington founded last year to meet the needs of Asian American and Pacific Islander women, girls, and the community.
The group, which also locally and nation-wide works to make an impact on public policy to drive systemic change, gathered nearly 2,000 signatures in a petition from Asian Hoosiers, community leaders and allies asking Holcomb to establish an Asian American and Pacific Islander statewide advisory committee that can help address issues such as racism, discrimination, language access, health care resources and legal help, among others.
The petition, which was delivered to the governor on March 11, also asks Holcomb to implement programs and resources to support the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities in Indiana without escalating law enforcement and to condemn these hate crimes publicly.
As of Thursday, the group had not gotten a response from the governor's office on the petition or guidance about how to move forward with an advisory committee.
On Wednesday, during a weekly COVID-19 press conference Holcomb spoke on anti-Asian hate crimes after a journalist asked him what he thought about the incident in Atlanta and the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes but he didn't address the petition.
""There is no place for it,"" he said.
""Not just in Indiana, but in the country.""
Anti-Asian hate crimes
In an emailed statement to IndyStar, Holcomb referenced Indiana's hate crimes bill, which he signed in 2019. The bill allows judges to consider bias when handing down criminal sentences based on a victim's real or perceived traits. That includes skin color, creed, disability, national origin, race, religion and sexual orientation.
The bill excludes gender, gender identity and age.
""Anyone that seeks to terrorize or cause fear needs to be held accountable for that. Racism is counter to Hoosier values. It's not what we stand for,"" he said in the statement.
""There is no higher priority than the safety and security of Hoosiers.""
Nationwide Asian women are targets of anti-Asian racism more often than men. According to a report by Stop AAPI Hate, women made up 68% of the reports, compared to men, who made up 29%.
Although there's no data yet available about the total of anti-Asian harassment incidents in Indiana, according to NAPAWF, some incidents have been documented in Plymouth, Chesterton, Martinsville and Mooresville.
The Anti-Defamation League tracked increases in white supremacist hate propaganda activity. In 2020, 57 such incidents were reported in Indiana, which is a 24% increase from 46 incidents in 2019.
'We are not OK'
Sunny Shuai, 44, said Asian Hoosiers have been scared to go out in public since the pandemic started due to the rise in discrimination.
Shuai immigrated from China and has been calling Indiana home for more than two decades.
""People tend to think that we're fine, that Asians are fine because we tend to stay quiet because we don't speak up as often as others, but we are not OK,"" she said. ""We have lived in fear for so long. We love the United States, this is our home but now we don't feel safe.""
Some Asian Hoosiers believe more outreach from elected officials and law enforcement is needed to build trust and prevent more fear from spreading in the community
Liz Prevot, 35, of Greenwood said Asian Hoosiers deserve to feel protected.
""As we watch these hate crimes go up, not only an advisory council is needed but we should be able to get to know our police officers and to understand what our rights are,"" Prevot said. ""We should be able to trust our police officers and we need to be working with them.""
According to Census data, Asian Hoosiers make up nearly 4% of Marion County's population and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Hoosiers make up less than 1%.
The population has grown in some Indianapolis suburbs and surrounding counties.
Asian Hoosiers make up 6% of Hamilton County's population, 7% of Monroe County's and 4% of Johnson County's population.
Statewide, Asian Hoosiers make up nearly 3% of the population. And according to the Migration Policy Institute, 34% of immigrants living in Indiana in 2019 were Asian.
Gurinder Hohl, who is the CEO of the Immigrant Welcome Center in Indianapolis, said there's a lack of awareness in the community about the injustice Asian Americans have faced through the years.
""The systemic racism that exists in our country needs to be addressed,"" Hohl said.
""We need to acknowledge that, and we need to keep telling the stories of these injustices the Asian communities are facing.""
Acknowledging the contributions of immigrants and Asian American and Pacific Islander Hoosiers could be a step forward, she said.
""We need to have conversations in the community,"" Hohl said, ""and create a space where they feel welcome and that's where elected officials can play a big role.""
Anyone who needs help and would like to get involved with the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum Indiana Chapter can email Indiana.Chapter.Leaders@napawf.org.
To report a hate crime, call The Indiana Civil Rights Commission at 317-232-2600, Toll Free 1-800-628-2909; via email at drichmond@crc.in.gov or call the Indiana State Police at 317-232-8983.

Hate crimes against Filipino/Asian Americans; FVR at 93,None,Others,2021-03-27,"The mounting violence and racism against Asian Americans, including Filipinos, in various parts of the US are deeply troubling.
Reports said that from March 2020 to February 2021, some 3,800 incidents of physical assault, verbal harassment, and other forms of discrimination against the Asian American community, mostly against women, have been reported.
In early February this year, a Filipino American Noel Quintana was slashed on his face with a box cutter in a New York City subway. Another Filipino American, 74-year-old Juanito Falcon, was punched in the face in Phoenix, Arizona who later died of his injuries. A Filipina American medical worker was also attacked in a train station in San Jose, California, as the assailant reportedly hurled expletives about her Asian ethnicity.
Our Philippine Embassy in Washington led by our friend Ambassador Jose Manuel Romualdez had earlier reminded our fellow Filipinos in the US to be extremely cautious following the vicious incidents. The embassy also called on US authorities to ensure the protection of Asian Americans, including Filipinos, in the midst of hate crimes which have been reportedly increasing rapidly since the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic last year.
President Joe Biden himself condemned the soaring hate crimes against Asian Americans, following the mass shooting last week in the state of Georgia which killed six women of Asian descent.
Biden urged the US Congress to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to combat the physical assault, verbal attack, and discrimination on account of race and ethnicity.
The US is home to more than four million Filipino Americans, with the largest community in California, Hawaii, and New York. In California, the Filipinos comprise the biggest population of Asian Americans.
According to Pew Research Center, a Washington-based nonpartisan think tank, the ""Asian Americans are the fastest-growing segment of eligible voters out of the major racial and ethnic groups in the United States."" The research group said the Asian American community has 11 million voters, ""making up nearly five percent of the nation's eligible voters.""
The Asian American community can harness their growing political influence to help shape national policies and advance common causes.

Former President Fidel V. Ramos celebrated his 93rd birthday last March 18.
A hero of the EDSA People Power Revolution, FVR served our country with great distinction, as a military officer who eventually became Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, Secretary of Defense, and President of the Philippines.
Even after serving as President, he continued to serve our country, our Asian region, and the international community, advancing the causes of peace, security, democracy and development, among others.
He and this columnist, together with the late Senator and Foreign Affairs Secretary Raul Manglapus, father of Christian Democracy in Asia, founded the Lakas-NUCD-UMDP (National Union of Christian Democrats-United Muslim Democrats of the Philippines), now Lakas-CMD (Christian Muslim Democrats), which became then former Defense Secretary Ramos' political vehicle which catapulted him to Malacanang in 1992.
We were also privileged to have been elected twice as Speaker of the House of Representatives, from 1992 to 1995, and from 1995 to 1998, during the Ramos presidency.
The Ramos and De Venecia families' ties go back many decades. Before the outbreak of World War II, our respective fathers, who were lawyers, both worked in the law office of Don Teofilo Sison, who became governor of Pangasinan, senator, and secretary of defense during the Philippine Commonwealth.
Narciso Ramos eventually became a congressman and foreign affairs secretary, while my father, Jose de Venecia Sr. served as provincial fiscal then the only Judge-at-Large in the entire Bicol region, then promoted as Judge of the Court of First Instance (CFI) in Nueva Vizcaya.
Many years later, in the mid-1960s, FVR and we crossed paths again in then South Vietnam. We were Presidential Assistant and assigned as Minister and Economic and Press Counselor at the Philippine Embassy in Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City), and Ramos, an Army Major, with the Philippine Civic Action Group (Philcag).
The Philcag had no combat duties, only civic action and engineering work, building roads, bridges, markets and hospitals but shielded by its own Security Battalion, and largely deployed in Tay Ninh province on the Cambodian frontier.
It was also in Vietnam where we met Captains Jose Almonte, who became National Security Adviser under Ramos; Renato de Villa, later Defense chief; psywar expert and civic action leader Jose Magno; Thelmo Cunanan, one of the rare Filipino West Pointers, who became a General, and later, a highly-regarded Ambassador to Cambodia, married to noted columnist Belinda Olivares-Cunanan; and Lieutenants Lisandro Abadia and Arturo Enrile, who later became heads of the Armed Forces, and many distinguished others.
We remember that whenever we visited the Philcag headquarters in Tay Ninh, near the Cambodian border, FVR would always remind us to put on our fatigues and a helmet, as the Vietcong snipers could spot us from several hundred meters away.
President Ramos and we are now in our senior years. We are most grateful to our fellow Pangasinenses and the Filipino people for giving us the opportunity to serve our beloved county, indeed a great honor and privilege and which we shall always cherish up to our age today at 84.
We also always tell our wife Gina, son Congressman Christopher and other children in the US and at home to thank the Lord every day for the gift of life.

Businesses defending themselves against rise in anti-Asian violence; Many Asian Americans feel authorities are not taking threats seriously,"Jan, T. ",Others,2021-03-26,"To San Antonio restaurateur Mike Nguyen, the threat was clear. Alongside the racist graffiti covering the windows of his ramen shop - ""Kung flu,"" ""Commie,"" ""Ramen noodle flu"" - were these words, spray-painted in red: ""Hope u die.""
Shock and hurt turned to rage, then fear. After Nguyen reported the vandalism to local law enforcement and the FBI, police agreed to step up drive-by patrols. But he and his employees would be left largely on their own.
Since the March 14 incident, the threats to Nguyen's life and business have escalated. Last week, someone wrote ""hope it burns down"" on the Instagram account for his restaurant, Noodle Tree. An anonymous man phoned the restaurant, reciting Nguyen's home address with a warning: ""We're coming for you.""
""The threats are getting more violent, more extreme,"" said Nguyen, 33.
Asian American entrepreneurs across the country are combating a sharp rise in racist threats and attacks on their businesses that many feel authorities are not taking seriously, even after last week's shooting rampage targeting three Asian spas in Atlanta left eight people dead.
Amid heightened fears, business owners have begun hiring their own security, buying guns and cutting their hours of operation as well as advertising, among other costly safety measures that limit their profits - and profile - at a time when businesses are already struggling, according to Asian American chambers of commerce and other business organizations.
Asian-owned restaurants, salons and shops rapidly lost business at the start of the pandemic because of racial stigma, fuelled by U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated references to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" and ""Kung flu."" Now, community leaders warn that the racism targeting these businesses could hamper the country's economic recovery from the coronavirus-induced recession.
""What happened in Atlanta is a very extreme example of the threat to human life, and folks have got to understand that as we try to emerge from COVID-19 and try to conduct business, there are other threats to contend with,"" said Lamar Heystek, president of the San Francisco-based Asian Inc., a non-profit that works with the U.S. Department of Commerce to develop economic opportunity for Asian Americans and other minorities. ""It doesn't take an economist to see how that could really dampen business activity and an economic recovery in which Asian American Pacific Islander-owned businesses take part.""
Asian Americans owned more than 10 per cent of all U.S. businesses in 2018. These firms earned $863 billion in receipts and employed 5.1 million people, Census Bureau data shows.
""How is that contribution muted by hate, discrimination and violence?"" Heystek said. ""We need to appreciate the systemic effect of these incidents that range from graffiti all the way up to death.""
It's not only businesses in urban centres like Chinatowns in San Francisco and New York that have become targets of racial harassment. So have Asian-owned businesses in suburban strip malls and rural America, Heystek said.
Businesses have been vandalized, robbed and attacked online in racist Yelp reviews. Employees, regardless of their ethnicity, have been blamed for the spread of the coronavirus.
At Nguyen's two-year-old ramen restaurant, graffiti scrawled on a patio table admonished him to ""Go back 2 China."" He is of Vietnamese and French descent.
The racist abuse began after he criticized Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's decision in early March to rescind a statewide mask mandate that was in place to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
With the perpetrators still at large, Nguyen, who is undergoing cancer treatment, said he's never feared more for his life. The threats come daily now, making him so ""paranoid"" that he does not allow people to get within 10 feet.
He had delayed fully reopening indoor dining because of the lack of police presence - and now must budget $5,700 a month on private security for the four days a week his restaurant is open. He temporarily skipped town. And he reluctantly bought a gun.
""I am personally against guns, but we had to get one just to protect ourselves now,"" Nguyen said. ""I can understand why a lot of Asian Americans don't want to report these things because of retaliation and lack of protection. Will it take for me to get seriously hurt or die for someone to take these threats seriously?"" The San Antonio Police Department issued a written statement saying that ""officers continue to provide drive-bys to the business. We have additionally contacted others in the area to report any suspicious activity and we will respond accordingly. This case remains actively under investigation and anyone with information is urged to contact police.""
Among the most vulnerable are retail businesses, restaurants and salons whose storefronts open to public sidewalks. Many store owners have kept their doors wide-open to improve ventilation during the pandemic. Not only have they recently begun shutting their doors, they're locking them and removing cultural signage and decor that could make them easy targets for people looking to terrorize Asian businesses, according to business owners and community leaders.

""I remember at the beginning of the pandemic, I was with my grandma in a Walgreens in San Francisco and this haphazard, haggard man runs in screaming profanities about Asian people and how they were bringing the virus in and how it was super dangerous. I don't think I've ever felt fear like that in my entire life.
""This was in San Francisco – supposed to be the liberal bubble within California, which is the most liberal state, in the most liberal country in the world. This was supposed to be the safest place and I felt physically in danger. I grabbed my grandma and we ran out. I was so scared. That moment was definitely a reset because I realised how close to home it hit. That anybody can be affected just because of the way they look or their culture and heritage."" Two-time Youth Olympic Games gold medallist Gu opted to compete under the Chinese flag two years ago. She has since won the country's first gold medals at the X-Games in January and two golds and a bronze at the Snowboard and Freeski World Championships in Aspen last weekend.
Born to an American father and Chinese mother, she now finds herself bridging a familiar cultural gap that has transcended the sports world. Gu called for those pushing racist, anti-Asian beliefs amid the Covid-19 pandemic to do their research. ""It's an absolutely absurd idea and it really comes from bigotry and a lack of information. Killing more Asian people isn't going to kill the virus,"" she said. ""At this point, America has by far the most cases and any American is just as likely to have it. It really comes from a sense of entitlement and misinformation – and also from people feeling threatened by these movements."" Andrew McNicol

Hundreds gather to condemn violence against Asian Americans The vigil at Portland's Payson Park comes amid a rise in anti-Asian violence across the U.S.,"Hoey, D.",Others,2021-03-31,"Hundreds gathered at Portland's Payson Park on Tuesday to support the state's Asian community and those who have been assaulted or killed recently in a surge of anti-Asian violence nationally.
Speakers at the vigil against anti-Asian violence called on the greater Portland community to condemn the hatred and make clear it will not be tolerated.
""Now, more than ever, it is crucial that we as a community stand together against hate,"" Thomas Ling, vice president of United Asian Communities, told the crowd, which exceeded 300 people.
Tuesday's vigil comes just two weeks after a Portland woman and her 12-year-old daughter were accosted by a man while waiting in line for an oil change on Forest Avenue.
Navii Chhay, who is of Asian descent, said she and her daughter were inside their vehicle when the man approached and started yelling at them to ""go back to your country."" In an interview before she read a statement to the crowd, Chhay said she was ""horrified"" by the man's behavior.
Since the incident on March 15, the Maine Attorney General's Office has said it will file a civil rights complaint against the Portland man accused of attacking Chhay and and her daughter. After the incident, Troy Sprague, 47, was arrested on charges of criminal mischief and interfering with constitutional and civil rights.
He has been released on bail. The attorney general's complaint seeks a protection order for Chhay and her family that prohibits Sprague from having any contact with them or violating the Maine Civil Rights Act. According to Attorney General Aaron Frey, Sprague kicked a side mirror off Chhay's car, and a piece of debris struck Chhay's daughter.
""We are bearing witness to an unconscionable increase in hate crimes being perpetrated against individuals of Asian descent in our nation,"" Frey said in a statement. ""We will not tolerate such attacks in Maine and we will act swiftly to address allegations like those received last week in Portland.""
Nationally, hate crimes against Asian-Americans have have been on the rise.
An Asian American woman was attacked in New York City on Monday by a man who repeatedly kicked her. Two people nearby, who appeared to be security guards, did not intervene, according to surveillance footage released by police. The 65-year-old woman was walking a few blocks from Times Square when the man approached and kicked her in the stomach, knocking her to the ground, police said. The man then stomped on the woman's face several times while shouting anti-Asian insults, police said. He then casually walked away, the footage shows.
Robert Aaron Long, 21, is accused of killing eight people, six of them Asian, at three Atlanta-area massage parlors in an attack that sent terror through the Asian-American community, which has increasingly been targeted during the coronavirus pandemic. It was the worst mass killing in the U.S. in almost two years.
The Atlanta-area killings horrified Asian-Americans, and was part of a growing number of assaults coinciding with the spread of COVID-19 across the United States. The virus was first identified in China, and former President Donald Trump and others have used racially charged terms to describe it.
Chhay, who was introduced as a business owner and photographer, was only able to read part of her statement to the vigil crowd before she was overcome with emotion. Her daughter finished reading her mother's statement.
""I thought Portland was a tucked away safe zone to live,"" Chhay wrote, adding that she was aware of attacks on other Asian-Americans across the country. ""I never dreamed this could happen to me. I was attacked for no other reason than my Asian heritage.
""We have been victims for far too long and I refuse to be a victim,"" Chhay said. ""There is strength in numbers and we need to let the world know that we are not going to take this anymore.""
""We are heartbroken,"" said another vigil speaker, Chan Himm, referring to the spate of anti-Asian hate incidents. Himm is the former president and chief executive officer of Unified Asian Communities. ""In Maine we are also dealing with anti-Asian hate. It (the attack on Chhay) is a stark reminder that we are not immune to hate.""
Several Portland Public School students held signs showing photographs of the Asian-Americans who have been killed or attacked in recent weeks. Each student read a brief profile of the victim and what happened to them.

Asian American veteran pummeled in San Francisco and police nab suspect for alleged hate crime,"Dima, J. ",Others,2021-03-23,"An Asian American veteran was allegedly assaulted during a trip to the grocery store in San Francisco in what police suspect is another hate crime against the Asian American community.
Ron Tuason, 56, a former combat engineer, said on March 13, a man uttered racial insults before punching him multiple times, sending him to the ground. Tuason is of Filipino, Chinese, and Spanish descent. 
Tuason, who uses a cane to walk, was carrying his groceries and sporting a veteran's hat when the alleged assault happened. 
“When he noticed me, he got aggressive and charged across the street, ‘Go back where you came from. You caused this problem.' He was referring to COVID,"" Tuason told KPIX 5. 
Tuason recalled the man asking, ""Do you want to get hurt? You’re not a veteran. I’m a veteran.""
Tuason tried to take a video of the incident with his phone, but it was knocked out of his hand during the scuffle. 
ELDERLY ASIAN WOMAN PUMMELS ATTACKER IN SAN FRANCISCO, WITNESSES SAY
“I had one arm out, my left arm, but he sidestepped that and came in from the outside, and he waylaid me, and he laid me out right here, and it was very swollen,” Tuason continued. “There was a chain-link fence, and I hit the steel post, and I was followed up with two lefts and a knee.”
San Francisco Police Department authorities apprehended 53-year-old Victor Brown and charged him with assault, hate crime battery, resisting arrest, and possession of narcotic paraphernalia in connection to the incident. 
“Because of the color of my skin, and because I like to wear a hat that says I served, that people who are minorities who are often neglected, overlooked invisible, we served,” Tuason said. 
The San Francisco Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Washington Examiner. 
A 79-year-old Asian woman pummeled an attacker who punched her without provocation earlier in March. The woman, who has not been publicly named, allegedly beat an unidentified man until he was bloodied. 
Video of the incident showed a crowd of people gathered around the woman as she held an ice pack to a gash on her face and yelled in Chinese at the suspected attacker, who was handcuffed to a stretcher.
Protests have erupted throughout the country following the apprehension of Robert Aaron Long, 21, who was arrested March 16 after allegedly opening fire at three different massage parlors, killing eight in the Atlanta area. 
He's suspected of killing at least four people and injuring another at the Young's Asian Massage Parlor before gunning down four more at the Gold Spa and Aroma Therapy Spa, which were across the street from one another just south of Interstate 85.

It was initially believed that Long had a hate motive as most of the victims were of Asian descent; however, authorities have not made the connection and have instead insisted the 21-year-old was suffering from sex addiction. 
The suspect allegedly wanted to ""eliminate"" temptation, adding further that he might have visited some of the locations in the past, police said. 
Hate crimes targeting Asian Americans have been on the rise since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, and California is one of the epicenters of the violence.

Stopping anti-Asian racism requires action and allies,None,Others,2021-03-05,"Since the summer of 2020 anti-racism has become a new battle cry in the fight for racial justice and re-
energized the movement. Asian communities are in crisis and need some of that same energy now. Since thebeginning of the pandemic, Asians have been and continue to be targeted with increasing violence at alarming
rates, reinforcing their existence as perpetual foreigners who do not truly belong here, whether born here or
not. The history of anti-Asian racism is long in the United States; this is the latest chapter of America not
wanting them here.
The U.S. reluctantly tolerated Chinese immigrants in the mid-1860s for backbreaking dangerous railroad work
that white workers would not do in order to connect the U.S. with the Transcontinental Railroad. Soon afterward,
the danger of Yellow Peril became a concern and in 1882, the first American stance on anti-immigration would
be the catalyst for future immigration policies, better known as the Chinese Exclusion Act. In February 1942, the
U.S. rounded up and interned Japanese Americans and Asian Americans of non-Japanese descent after the
bombing of Pearl Harbor.
The model minority myth has been, and continues to be, used as a racial wedge to further policies against Black
communities (and other nonwhite groups). But has there been progress? Well there's a whole heritage month
for Asians in May. Now think back to how many non-Asians posted about it on their social media as they do for
Pride, Black History, or Hispanic Heritage months. AAPI Awareness Month did not even become official until
1992. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic made navigating public spaces dangerous for Asians. The prior
administration's insistence to call it the China/Chinese virus only helped to incite anti-Asian attacks to startling
numbers. In April, NBC News reported over 30% of Americans have witnessed COVID-19 bias against Asians.
Even more problematic is that attackers are not easily recognizable, they are not a ""type"" and have no specific
race, identity, or group.
Indeed, Asian Americans are fair game for everyone as evidenced by Jose Gomez's confession in his attempt to
murder an Asian American family including a 2-year-old child in Midland, Texas. Let that sink in - a 2-year-old
child, simply because they are Asian. Phased reopenings show an increase in these attacks as some view Asians
as the cause of the virus, or even as a virus themselves. Even medical professionals on the front lines saving
lives regardless of patient race or identity are in danger because they are Asian. In January of this year, an 84-
year-old Thai man was pushed to his death in San Francisco. The elderly are especially vulnerable to recent
attacks and Asian businesses are being violently vandalized across the country.
An early response to this current wave of anti-Asian racism came from highly visible Asian leader and former
presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who advised Asian Americans in a Washington Post op-ed to ""show our
American-ness in ways we never have before,"" by helping the country in its time of need. The implication of
Yang's response is for Asian Americans to continue the perpetuation of the model minority myth, the danger of
which extols the virtue to suffer in silence. Do not make waves; keep your head down. A more recent response
came from President Joe Biden, in the form on an executive order he signed days after his inauguration in an
attempt to address the situation with directives to federal agencies.
What Asian Americans (and Asians globally) do need to fight against anti-Asian racism is active allyship from
non-Asians. To start with, when Asians (or Black, Indigenous, or persons of color - BIPOC) express experiences
of racism, whether witnessed or not, do not dismiss their concerns. BIPOC folks survive racism on a continuousbasis and to not believe their lived experiences and fears is a flagrant flaunting of privilege. Asians need non-
Asian folks to check in, speak out, stand up, and advocate for them through whatever platforms they have.Support of #StopAsianHate does not diminish anti-racism support of Black communities and other marginalized
groups.",4150
Commentary: Surging anti-Asian hate crimes and America's inherent human rights sins,None,Others,2021-03-25,"BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The videos and images of a 76-year-old Asian woman pitifully crying with a bruised eye after being assaulted by a white man in San Francisco have gone viral on social media and shocked the whole world.The elderly woman who bravely beat off the attacker was yet the latest victim of a surging tide of anti-Asian violence and hate crimes in the United States, which has traumatized millions of Asian Americans and plunged them into growing fear. Ealier this month, six Asian Americans were shot dead in cold blood by a young white gunman in Atlanta, Georgia.When people across the world are expressing sympathy for the victims as well as their indignation against those perpetrators, they are also wondering why the United States, a country known as a nation of immigrants, is struggling with waves of violence and xenophobia?With a short history densely stained by a racist tradition, the country built by immigrants is unsurprisingly infamous for racial discrimination. From the state-sanctioned killings of native Indians and the extreme abusive policies against African slaves and Chinese laborers, to the Chinese Exclusion Act and the Immigration Act of 1924, the United States has a deplorable track record in maltreating its minority groups.As time passes, such a racist tradition has turned more extreme and violent. When political, economic and social problems arise, ethnic minorities have always been made the scapegoats. That is also the case in the COVID-19 pandemic, which has so far infected over 30 million people in the world's most developed country.To gloss over the country's incompetence in fighting the pandemic and shift the blame, unscrupulous Washington politicians and media outlets have been explicitly manipulating racist rhetoric and sentiments by linking the deadly pathogen to specific ethnic groups, leading to increasing violence and hate against Asian Americans.According to Stop AAPI Hate, a California-based nonprofit social organization tracking incidents of violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, it received nearly 3,800 reports of attack or abuse against people of Asian descent between March 2020 to February 2021.Erika Lee, a historian and the author of ""America for Americans,"" described the acts of racism and violence facing Asian American and Pacific Islander communities ""a systemic national tragedy.""Behind the tragedy is the U.S. society's deep-seated and long-standing white supremacy, a belief that white people constitute a superior race and should therefore dominate the society. This extremist bigotry has gained fresh momentum in recent years from the intensified polarization of American politics.In 2020, distribution of white supremacist propaganda in the United States increased nearly twofold from a year ago, with 5,125 incidents of racist, anti-Semitic and other hateful messages being reported, according to the Anti-Defamation League, an anti-hate organization headquartered in New York.Regrettably, successive U.S. administrations have been tolerant and insensitive to these problems, letting the systemic national tragedy deprive ethnic minorities of their basic rights in wealth distribution, employment, healthcare, education and political participation.In fact, devastating racism is only the tip of the iceberg of America's mess in human rights protection. China's State Council Information Office on Wednesday issued the Report on Human Rights Violations in the United States in 2020, depicting the whole picture of the country's chaotic human rights situation.Besides comprehensive, systematic and continuous racism, the report also disclosed Washington's incompetent pandemic containment, the American democracy disorder, the continuous social unrest, the growing polarization between the rich and the poor as well as the U.S. trampling on international rules that has resulted in worldwide humanitarian disasters.With mounting pressure from nationwide protests against anti-Asian hate, the U.S. government is likely to take some perfunctory measures. But one thing is clear: without sweeping reforms and an earnest attitude, Uncle Sam can hardly clean up its mess in human rights protection, let alone act as a beacon.",4237
Alleged Atlanta spa shooter charged with murder and assault ,"Brest, M. ",Others,2021-03-17,"The man accused of killing eight people at three different Atlanta-area spas this week has been charged. 
Robert Aaron Long, 21, was charged with four counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault in the shooting and has no bond, according to the Atlanta police department. 
EIGHT DEAD IN SHOOTINGS AT THREE ATLANTA-AREA MASSAGE PARLORS 
He allegedly shot and killed at least four people and injured one when he opened fire at the Young’s Asian Massage Parlor around 5:00 p.m. About an hour later, police were dispatched to the Gold Spa and Aroma Therapy Spa, where four more dead victims were found. These spas are across the street from one another, just south of Interstate 85. Seven of the victims were women. 
Six of the eight victims were also reportedly Asian, leading many to suspect a hate crime, given an increase in hate crimes against the Asian American community since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, however, the alleged shooter claimed that was false. 
On Wednesday, police released the names of the four people who were killed at the Young's Asian Massage Parlor: Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Xiaojie Yan, 49; and Daoyou Feng, 44. Elcias R. Hernandez-Ortiz, 30, was identified by police as the person injured during the shooting. 
Long, in his interrogation with police, claimed that his attack was not racially motivated, law enforcement announced during a Wednesday briefing. 
Captain Jay Baker said Long “did take responsibility for the shooting,” and he said the alleged perpetrator claimed to be a “sex addict.” Long also allegedly called these parlors a “temptation” that he wanted to “eliminate.”

Hate crimes against Asian Americans spiked 150% throughout 2020, a year largely upended by the coronavirus pandemic, that is speculated to have fueled some of the rise in violence after the virus was first discovered in China in late 2019, according to a study from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.

"Education can help in the fight against racism: Bernard Chan says in a world reeling from pandemic-induced crises, it is easy to pin the blame on 'others' – and with China an easy target, all Asians have become collateral damage","Chan, B.",Others,2021-03-12,"In January, Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thai man living with his family in San Francisco went out for his usual morning walk. A man attacked him by slamming into him.
The elderly man died of a brain haemorrhage a few days later.
Peng Wang, a Chinese academic in Southampton, England, was out jogging in February when he was assaulted by four white men who yelled at him to ""go home"" before punching
and kicking him. In Paris, a Japanese citizen was attacked by acid-throwing thugs.
The news these days is filled with upsetting stories like these, with equally discouraging statistics. Britain reported a 21 per cent increase in hate crimes against Asians last May
during the coronavirus crisis. In a recent survey, one in five Chinese-Australians say they have been a target of racially based attacks in the past year. And in the United States,
police departments and community groups are creating task forces to deal with a surge in racial attacks against Asians.
Like many Hongkongers reading about these terrible incidents, I am shocked and concerned about the recent surge in anti-Asian attacks, and I have been trying to come to an
understanding about why they are happening now. I know that anti-Asian racism is nothing new in modern history – certainly not in Western countries such as the US.
Here in Asia, we have had dark moments of racial strife – the violence against the Chinese community in Indonesia in 1998, and the racial discrimination faced by Koreans in Japan
come to mind.
What all these moments in history have in common is that they were sparked by economic and political tension. When countries are at odds, and economic times are tough, it is
easy to pin the blame on ""others"". People often become collateral damage.
In a world reeling from pandemic-related economic crises, people are looking for scapegoats. And China is an easy target, since Covid-19 was first reported in Wuhan. Last
October, a Pew Research Centre survey found that 73 per cent of Americans – and 81 per cent of Australians – have an unfavourable view of China. This offers a clue to why there
has been a recent surge of anti-Asian racist hate crimes. That Thais, Japanese and even Koreans have found themselves the target of anti-Chinese sentiment points to another
unfortunate racial issue that we Asians encounter in Western countries. Many Westerners cannot distinguish between, say, a Japanese or a Vietnamese. We are all ""Chinese"".
Here in Hong Kong, we are not without blame when it comes to racial bias. We should be doing more to support equal opportunity in our South Asian community. The Hong Kong
roots of ethnic Indians, Pakistanis and Nepalese families in many cases go back longer than that of recent arrivals in Hong Kong from the mainland. Yet many Hongkongers treat
them like foreigners.
On the other hand, in Hong Kong, we do have a strong bent towards meritocracy. Foreigners and Chinese alike come here for opportunities. Talent, not race, was the criteria for
the appointment of top Argentinian financier Nicolas Aguzin as head of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.
Likewise, in the US, we are beginning to see the rise of an Asian-American meritocracy, with prominent members of the community becoming public figures and entering politics at
the highest level. Andrew Yang, of Chinese heritage, is a leading candidate for mayor of New York City. And the second-highest position in the country is held by Vice-President
Kamala Harris, who has South Asian roots.
These achievements give me hope that racial bias and hate crimes against Asians will become a rare thing. One way we can discourage racism is through education. The more you
learn about other peoples and cultures, the less likely you are to stereotype them all as dangerous ""others"".
Perhaps the most important way to combat these surges of racism is to support leaders who do not use race as a tactic to divide the public. Political and national tensions are a
fact of life. But when national leaders unjustly blame other countries, they are sowing bad seeds. And from those seeds grow bitter fruit such as the violence we are seeing in San
Francisco, Southampton and Paris.

“I don’t feel safe anymore”: Asian Texans grapple with racism after a gunman killed Asian women in Atlanta,"Agnew, D.",Others,2021-03-19,"San Antonio resident Mike Nguyen is afraid to be outside these days. Earlier this week, he was driving with his colleague when they pulled over to help someone pick up boxes, but he froze up when they parked the car on the side of the street.
He couldn’t leave the car. It’s not that he didn’t want to help. It was the death threats he had received recently that kept him in.
“I can’t even go out and help a fellow person in the community because I’m afraid that I might get attacked,” said Nguyen, whose restaurant was vandalized and spray-painted with racist slurs after he spoke out against Gov. Greg Abbott’s lifting of a statewide mask mandate. “I’m not stepping out of this car right now.”
Nguyen said that while he was angry over the racist attack on his business, news of a gunman killing eight people — including six women of Asian descent — at three spas in the Atlanta area has added a heightened sense of fear to the already complicated mix of emotions he’s feeling.
“I’m emotionally tired. I’m angry. I’m frustrated,” he said. “I think a lot of Asian Americans are frustrated that you see these crimes happening, but nothing’s happening. There’s no stop to it, and people are trying to make it that it’s not a hate crime.”
Cherokee County authorities identified the four victims of the shooting at Youngs Asian Massage in Acworth, Georgia, as Delaina Ashley Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Tan and Daoyou Feng, according to media reports. The only survivor of the shooting, Elcias R. Hernandez-Ortiz, remains hospitalized with significant injuries. On Thursday, Fulton County officials named the victims from the other two shootings as Soon C. Park, Hyun J. Grant, Suncha Kim and Yong A. Yue.
The attacks in Atlanta are the latest in a wave of increasing assaults in the U.S. targeting Asians during the global COVID-19 pandemic. As the virus spread, the anti-Asian hostility climbed. Former President Donald Trump regularly referred to COVID-19 as the “Chinese virus.” For over a year now, Asian Texans have battled a heightened sense of fear on top of disproportionate job losses and business closures during the pandemic. A recent Pew Research Center study even found that 58% of Asian Americans say that people more commonly express racist views toward their group since the pandemic began.
Stop AAPI Hate, an organization founded during the pandemic to track incidents of anti-Asian discrimination, received 3,795 reported incidents of racism against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders across the United States between March 19, 2020 and Feb. 28, 2021. Of those attacks, 68% targeted Asian women, according to the group’s most recent report.
In Texas, Stop AAPI Hate has tracked 103 anti-Asian racist incidents that have occurred since March 2020, when a native of Myanmar and his two sons were stabbed in a Midland Sam’s Club by a man who believed the father was Chinese and spreading the coronavirus in the store.
Asian Texans have also reported verbal abuse and being spit at and coughed on, according to the group.
“Honestly, I don’t feel safe anymore,” said a Chinese American Austin resident who spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared that she could be targeted. She said that last month, a white man driving past her stuck out his middle finger at her for no reason.
“Even when I’m driving inside my car, I cannot take off my mask. I have to put it on,” she said. “I don’t want those things to happen again. I really don’t know if they have a gun, if they’re gonna shoot me any time. I don’t know. I just feel like it’s a trauma.”
In Houston, the Police Department released a statement Wednesday announcing a plan to increase patrols in certain neighborhoods and to organize a town hall to address concerns about anti-Asian hate crimes.
Amy Zhang, a Ph.D student in sociology at the University of Texas at Austin and a researcher for the AAPI COVID-19 Project, said that pandemic-related racism and more cautious tendencies among the Asian population combined to impact the Asian community harder and earlier than other groups.
“People were experiencing things, especially early on, that were very much this racialization of being Asian as contagion, where just existing in public while Asian was kind of seen as a threat to some people,” said Zhang. (Zhang previously worked for the Texas Tribune as a fellow.)
This kind of racialization of a disease can result in material impacts like unemployment increases, rises in depression and anxiety rates and a distrust of other people, according to Kara Takasaki, another UT-Austin Ph.D student and analyst for the AAPI COVID-19 project.
Amy Mok, the founder of the Asian American Cultural Center in Austin, also added that labeling the virus as Asian will impact the social reality for Asian Americans for many months, and possibly years, to come.
“There are questions from our children we do not know how to answer, when they ask, ‘Why do they hate us so much? Why do they call it Chinese virus or Kung-flu virus?’” Mok said. “So it is very hard for children. And then they go back to school and they have their friends, young friends, saying ‘Oh, you are the Chinese virus.’”
And with Tuesday’s attack in Atlanta targeting Asian women, the intersection between misogyny and anti-Asian discrimination remains ever-present in Texas and across the country. The labels that people attribute to Asian women perpetuates a culture of hypersexualization, Mok said.
“Look at how we label Asian women: madame butterfly, mail-order bride,” Mok said. “The exotic, the erotic Asian woman, so we are reduced to be what? Sex objects.”
A harsh reality and an uncertain path forward
Takasaki noted how structural racism within a society ultimately cuts off a population’s access to basic resources like federal assistance and health insurance, which in turn can lead to a lack of solutions when people’s mental and physical health worsens.
Asian American businesses often face a much longer road to recovery after a crisis or disaster, according to Russell Jeung, a San Francisco State University professor and one of the founders of Stop AAPI Hate. Asian restaurants and stores took the longest to recover after the 2008 recession, Jeung said, adding that Chinatowns across the country were already experiencing economic problems before the pandemic from the effects of gentrification.
“Asian Americans have really been hit hard with joblessness during COVID-19, and that’s partially due to a lot of us work[ing] in the service sector, and those businesses have closed down,” Jeung said. “Secondly, a lot of us work in ethnic enclaves and ethnic neighborhoods, ethnic markets, and because of racism, people have shunned going to Chinese restaurants, Vietnamese nail salons, and so those businesses have had to close.”
State Rep. Gene Wu, D-Houston, said that while he hasn’t directly seen any incidents of discrimination taking place in his district, some residents may be afraid to report experiencing racism. He recently introduced a resolution in the Legislature that expresses support for eradicating racism and calls on law enforcement to fully investigate any reported incidents of anti-Asian hate.
“Asian American businesses have suffered not so much because of direct discrimination, because of race, but because of the poor handling of the response to COVID,” Wu said. “Is there a component of businesses are not doing well because people don’t like Asian people? I’m sure that’s there, but there’s no way for me to quantify that.”
Several business owners told The Texas Tribune that hostility toward Asian Texans and the struggles of the service industry during the pandemic have made them question their line of work.
“There are days where you get up, and you literally don’t feel like doing anything because it just seems like there’s so much burden, and it’s just easier not to think about it,” said Kristina Zhao, the owner of Sichuan House, a San Antonio restaurant.
Alice Lee, the executive director of the Southwest Management District in Houston that includes the city’s Chinatown, added that the pandemic combined with the rise in discrimination has hit Asian women the hardest, especially in the wake of this week’s attacks in Atlanta.
“His attack against Asian women is just horrific. It’s really women who have lost the most during the pandemic,” Lee said. “They are the ones who lost the most jobs. They have to stay home while their kids do online learning. They can’t really pivot to other employment, so really that’s a double or triple whammy for women in general.”
High unemployment rates and anti-Asian discrimination have also worsened institutional inequities when it comes to other areas of life like access to health care and work satisfaction, according to Zhang and Takasaki.
Beyond the wave of violence, there’s the outsize impact of the pandemic on Asian workers. Between March 2020 and January 2021, the Asian population in the state filed an average of 31,908 claims per month, representing an annual increase of 1,087%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor. That rise in unemployment far outpaced the increases experienced by all other racial groups in the state, although around 45% of claims since March 2020 did not report the applicant’s race.
Recent research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics also suggests that the ability to work from home during the pandemic heavily depends on race and educational attainment. The non-Hispanic white population works from home at the highest rate of any racial group in the nation, and over 67% of people with a college degree have the ability to telework. On the other hand, less than a quarter of high school graduates have access to remote work.
Still, Asian Texans are hoping that better times lie ahead, and they have found comfort in their families and coworkers for the time being, despite the immense challenges that they continue to face.
K.C. Youn, who owns an environmental engineering company in Houston, immigrated to the United States from South Korea 61 years ago while a senior in high school. He still gets emotional any time he thinks about the partnerships made between American and Korean soldiers during the Korean War, and the connection between his Korean and American identities remains close to his heart.
“Many of my friends who traveled and immigrated to Europe and so on, they all basically want to come to the United States eventually because this is the place to be in this world,” Youn said. “But unfortunately, even the United States is not perfect.”
Nguyen is grateful for the Asian American community having his back throughout the pandemic and especially since his restaurant was tagged with racist graffiti. Many people have asked him how they can help or show him support, and he decided to start collecting gift card donations to provide free meals for San Antonio residents. So far, he’s raised over $3,000.
“There’s a saying, a proverb, that says ‘If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together,’” said Christine Ha, who owns Xin Chao, a Houston restaurant. “And I think that’s something that we try to instill in our staff as well at both restaurants, just to remember that yeah, it’s hard, but we’re all here for each other.”

Stabber 'doesn't care about colors' ; Hate charges dropped in brutal attack on Asian,"Moynihan, E., & Chelsia Rose Marcius With,Kerry Burke.",Others,2021-03-02,"An accused attacker who left an Asian man clinging to life after stabbing the stranger on a Manhattan street has a
history of violence and mental illness - but never showed any obvious signs of racial bias, his family says.
Salman Muflehi, 23, who was charged Thursday with knifing the 36-year-old victim in Chinatown, often threatened
family members when he was off his medication, and was previously charged with assaulting his brother in 2019 and
for attacking another man in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, this year.
But Muflehi - initially charged last week with two counts of a hate crime before prosecutors said there was no
evidence the stabbing was racially motivated - never displayed any biased tendencies, said his brother Montaser
Muflehi.
""He didn't care about colors, he doesn't care about that. ... If he sees someone look at him, or talking on the phone
and look at him, he thinks they're talking about him,"" 26-year-old Montaser told the Daily News on Sunday. ""We did
everything we could for him. ... He's always in trouble.""
The stabbing incident is one of the latest in a series of random attacks on Asian-Americans across the city.
Police have made 18 arrests in 28 incidents of ""COVID-related"" hate crimes against Asians since the start of the
pandemic, though the commanding officer of the NYPD Asian Hate Crimes Task Force acknowledged many more incidents have likely gone unreported.
Muflehi was charged Saturday with attempted murder, two counts of assault and criminal possession of a weapon,
officials said.
Yet the wife of the 36-year-old victim, who asked that her name not be used, says she still hasn't ruled out the
possibility that the stabbing was racially motivated.
""I'm torn about this being a hate crime. ... Why would he attack an Asian man in Chinatown at this time?"" she told
The News, referring to the recent string of attacks. ""Even a mentally ill person can commit a hate crime.""
Muflehi first showed signs he was struggling with mental health issues at age 17, around the time he moved to New
York from Yemen, his family said. He later went back to Yemen, where his health seemed to improve - but began to
unravel again when he returned to New York.
""When he came back home ... maybe [for] a month or two months [he was] good. Then he flipped,"" said Montaser.
Muflehi was charged with assault in September 2019 for throwing a bottle that struck Montaser in the head, police
said.
""He gets mad so fast,"" Montaser said, recalling the incident.
Montaser said his sibling received mental health help while behind bars, and he appeared to improve while on
prescription drugs.
""He gave him some medication, the doctor, and he became a normal guy,"" Montaser said. ""For four, five, six months
he was nice and quiet, he was really a completely different person.""
But it didn't take long for Muflehi take another dark turn. On Jan. 12 he allegedly punched a 28-year-old man in the
head inside a Sunset Park deli, knocking him to the ground .
""He just came up behind me and hit me. I said 'I think you have the wrong dude, I don't even know you,' "" said the
victim, who asked that his name not be used.
""He said I looked at him wrong. I was talking on the phone when I walked in and he said I was talking about him.""
""I think that guy just has anger issues and is out there to hurt people,"" said the victim, who got a restraining order
against Muflehi. ""He said I want to go get a knife to stab you.""
Muflehi's mother, Safia Saeed, had heard her son make similar threats in recent years.
""He'd say, 'I want to kill you, I want to kill myself,' "" Saeed, 63, told The News in Arabic.
""We tried to take him to the doctor and he said no.""
""He's got no mind,"" she added with a sullen look as she tapped the top of her head. ""He needs help.""",3762
NYPD Uses Decoys to Fight Hate Crimes --- Plainclothes officers of Asian descent will patrol public spaces to identify suspects,"Chapman, B.",Others,2021-03-26,"The New York Police Department will begin using undercover officers as decoys in an attempt to combat a rise in hate crimes targeting Asian-Americans in New York City, police officials said Thursday.
Plainclothes NYPD officers of Asian descent will be deployed in the city's public spaces to identify perpetrators of hate crimes and to discourage anti-Asian violence, NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said at a news briefing.
The department also will refer all unprovoked attacks on Asians in the city for investigation as possible hate crimes, police officials said.
A crime designated as a hate crime carries a heavier penalty than a similar act without the designation.
New York City has experienced an increase in hate crimes against Asians since the start of the pandemic, according to NYPD statistics. The fact that Covid-19 was first identified in China has led some people to blame Asian-Americans, police officials have said.
Last year, the NYPD recorded 28 hate crimes against Asians, up from three in 2019. Asians were targeted in 28 hate crimes from Jan. 1 through March 25 of this year, compared with seven such crimes in the same period last year, according to the NYPD.
While the number of hate crimes counted by the NYPD is relatively small compared with other crimes, officials believe hate crimes are underreported.
""Like much of America we've seen a disturbing spike in hate crimes targeting Asian-Americans in New York City,"" Mr. Shea said.
NYPD officials said the types of hate crimes committed against Asians in the city have included assaults and harassment. The officials said motives for the crimes have varied, but suspects in several instances have been people experiencing homelessness or mental-health issues.
Other U.S. cities, such as Los Angeles and Oakland, Calif., also have seen a rise in hate crimes targeting Asians, prompting people to form volunteer patrols in some communities. A series of shootings at spas in the Atlanta area on March 16 claimed the lives of eight people, six of whom were women of Asian descent.
The suspect in the attacks has been charged with eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault, officials said.
While according to police the suspect said he targeted the businesses ""for providing an outlet for his addiction to sex,"" Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Charles Hampton Jr. said on March 18 that investigators were still considering all options, including the possibility the incident was a hate crime.
Mr. Shea said Thursday that the NYPD also would expand its tools to fight hate crimes with new programs, staffing adjustments and changes to existing protocols for investigations.
Two detectives will be added to the NYPD's Asian Hate Crime Task force, raising the group's number of detectives to 18, police officials said.
The Task Force was begun amid the pandemic and is staffed by detectives of Asian descent who speak a combined nine Asian languages. The group is tasked with guiding victims through the justice system, from reporting a crime to prosecution.
The task force's founding supervisor, NYPD Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo, said Thursday that he is retiring. Mr. Loo is being succeeded on the Task Force by NYPD Inspector Tommy Ng.
Mr. Ng joined the NYPD in 1997 and was the first commanding officer in the city to conduct community meetings in Chinese at the Fifth Precinct in Manhattan's Chinatown neighborhood.

Maine AG to file complaint in anti-Asian attack The civil rights complaint seeks an order protecting the Portland family from any contact with the man charged.,"Ohm, R. ",Others,2021-03-23,"The Maine Attorney General's Office is filing a civil rights complaint against a Portland man accused of attacking an Asian-American woman and her daughter last week and telling the woman to ""go back to your country.""
Troy Sprague, 47, was arrested Saturday on charges of criminal mischief and interfering with constitutional and civil rights. He has been released on bail.
The attorney general's complaint seeks an order protecting the woman and her family by prohibiting Sprague from having any contact with them and from violating the Maine Civil Rights Act in the future.
""We are bearing witness to an unconscionable increase in hate crimes being perpetrated against individuals of Asian descent in our nation,"" Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey said in a news release. ""We will not tolerate such attacks in Maine and we will act swiftly to address allegations like those received last week in Portland.
""We encourage any member of Maine's Asian-American community to contact their local law enforcement agency if they encounter threats or acts of violence or property damage based on bias against their race, ancestry or national origin. We will review all such cases to determine whether they meet the criteria for enforcement under our Civil Rights Act.""
Marpheen Chann, president of the Cambodian Community Association of Maine and an educator at the Holocaust and Human Rights Center of Maine, applauded the attorney general's action Monday, though he said there is still work to be done in law enforcement when it comes to recognizing and responding to racism.
""I think it's a very important statement from AG Frey,"" Chann said. ""We need to call racism for what it is. It's racism and this act was a racist act against an Asian-American woman and her daughter while trying to go about their day. I think Attorney General Frey has taken a step in the right direction for calling it what it is and alerting the public that this isn't acceptable behavior.""
The woman and her daughter were in their car waiting for an oil change at 471 Forest Ave. last week, the complaint states. Sprague was walking along the road when he turned and started swearing at the woman, telling her to ""go back to your country"" and ""you Chinese go back to your country.""
Sprague then jumped over the guardrail separating the sidewalk from the service station and began kicking the woman's partially opened window. His kicking damaged her rearview mirror, causing debris to fly into her car and hit her daughter.
Police have said Sprague is homeless and it was unclear Monday if he has an attorney.
There is no criminal charge of ""hate crime"" in Maine statute. A person accused of civil rights violations may be charged for interference with constitutional or civil rights or, in cases where there is an injunction under the Civil Rights Act, for a knowing violation of a civil rights injunction. Both are Class D crimes punishable by up to 364 days in jail and a $2,000 fine.
In addition, any crime may be treated as a hate crime at sentencing if the court finds that the defendant targeted the victim due to the victim's ""race, color, religion, sex, ancestry, national origin, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation or homelessness.""
While there is a federal hate crimes statute, it has a higher threshold for bringing prosecution and comes with restrictions on the circumstances under which a case may be brought, such as that the crime resulting in willful bodily injury or attempted bodily injury. There are also certain circumstances pertaining to the federal charge such as if the crime takes place across state lines or involves a weapon that has traveled in interstate or foreign commerce.
A recent study by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism found anti-Asian hate crimes increased 145 percent last year in America's largest cities, even as overall hate crimes dropped 6 percent.
Last week, in the wake of the killing of eight people, including six Asian-American women, in Georgia, President Biden said he supports the passage of a COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which would expedite the federal government's response to the rise of hate crimes exacerbated during the pandemic, support state and local governments to improve hate crimes reporting, and ensure that hate crimes information is more accessible to Asian-American communities.

Local Asian communities worry after Atlanta killings,"Chao, M. ",Others,2021-03-18,"Along a busy commercial corridor across from the Fort Lee Community Center, Grace Kim reflected on how vulnerable she felt after the attacks that killed six Asian American women in Georgia on Tuesday.
Eight people in all died in three shootings at Atlanta-area spas, before police arrested a 21-year-old man accused of being the lone gunman. Although the suspect reportedly told police that race was not a motive, the deaths came after a spate of high-profile assaults on Asian Americans and after months of rhetoric blaming the community for the spread of the coronavirus.
""Since our salon is Asian, it is definitely concerning,"" said Kim, 25, a family owner of New Splendid Nail and Spa in Fort Lee. ""We have a fear we can be targeted.""
Across North Jersey, home to one of the country's biggest concentrations of Asian Americans, conversations in the communities Wednesday centered on a growing sense of being under attack – and a search for solutions.
""You always have this fear,"" Kim said. ""You don't know if you're going to be pushed or attacked. We don't know why we're being hated. Our race and our appearance – we're born into it.""
There are over 1,400 nail salons in the state owned by Korean Americans, said John Sohn, president of the Korean American Nail Salon Association of New Jersey, based in Palisades Park. The organization is keeping a watchful eye on crimes against Asian Americans, Sohn said.
During the pandemic, most salons are requiring appointments, he added, explaining that cutting down on walk-in traffic helps with safety.
Police said the Atlanta suspect, Robert Aaron Long, 21, of Woodstock, Georgia, told authorities that his actions were not racially motivated and that he frequented some of the spas where the shootings took place. Long viewed the spas as ""a temptation that he wanted to eliminate,"" said Capt. Jay Baker, a spokesman for the sheriff's office in Cherokee County, north of Atlanta.
Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant said it was too soon in the investigation to say whether the shootings were a hate crime. ""We are just not there as of yet,"" Bryant said during a Wednesday news conference.
Nonetheless, elected officials in North Jersey said they're being proactive in preventing hate crimes against Asian Americans. In Palisades Park, where almost 60% of residents identify as Asian, Mayor Chris Chung, who is Korean American, said the borough will adopt a resolution next week addressing hate crimes. He is also planning Zoom meetings to educate the public about Asian Americans and their place in this country.
""This is not acceptable,"" Chung said. ""We all need to get along. This is not an ethnic pandemic. It is a worldwide pandemic.""
Stop AAPI Hate, a nonprofit that tracks harassment and attacks against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, recorded 3,795 incidents of anti-Asian discrimination across the U.S. from March 19, 2020, to Feb. 28, 2021, according to data from a self-reporting survey released before the Georgia shootings.
Women report hate incidents 2.3 times more than men, and Koreans are the second-largest ethnic group that reports experiencing hate, according to the new data. The South Korean Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that its diplomats in Atlanta confirmed that four of the women killed Tuesday were of Korean descent.
""This breaks my heart,"" said Mark Sokolich, the mayor of Fort Lee, where 42% of residents are Asian American, according to census figures. He has been meeting with local Asian American leaders and plans to produce a video to educate the public on the pandemic and the rich history of Asian Americans in the borough.
Sokolich encourages people who have experienced hate in this heated climate to call the Fort Lee police. There have been very few incidents reported during the pandemic, but that may be because people are reluctant to come forward, he said.
No matter the situation, if someone thinks they are the victim of racism, they should call the police, Sokolich said.
""Nothing is too small to report,"" he said.
In February, a group of Korean American teens from North Jersey faced a verbal assault in New York's Times Square. Leonia High School sophomore Yena Choe said a middle-aged woman glared at the group of face-masked youths and told them, ""Get away from me!"" while waving her hands.
In Wyckoff, a Chinese restaurant was vandalized last June with the words ""coronavirus"" and ""go home"" spray-painted on the windows and sidewalk.
Asian American communities ""were already set on edge; we were alarmed by the rate of violence and hate directed towards us,"" Russell Jeung, the founder of Stop AAPI Hate, said Wednesday. ""The shooting is again the worst type of violence we could go through ... it can't continue.""
The FBI collects national hate crime data, but data for 2020 and 2021 has not yet been released. In 2019, 216 anti-Asian hate crimes were reported.
That number may be just a fraction of the true total, given that fewer than half of the victims of a hate crime ever report it to the police, according to data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.

STOP ASIAN HATE,"Sugarman, S. ",Others,2021-03-28,"LAST CALL WITH SAUL
Reach out to an Asian friend, or make one
I have lived most my adult life in Asian neighborhoods. I moved to Mainland China shortly after college for a variety of reasons- a big one was that my privileged childhood brought me to many countries, but comparatively to so little of Asia. I landed in a ""small"" city in the Hunan province, three hours by train outside of Guilin, and my first six months had its challenges. I taught English to hundreds of noisy high schoolers, and my apartment was at most 30 steps away from my students' classrooms.
The city I lived in, Yongzhou, almost never saw foreigners - eager students often came by unannounced with photographers to take pictures with us. I learned to wear a hoodie when going to the grocery store. And without speaking Mandarin, I grew to rely on a community around me to keep me safe and to get me where I needed to go. Often that meant getting on the backs of motorcycles without ever knowing if I was understood.
The next six months in Shanghai, I lived a much more cosmopolitan life and thought about ways to re-enter journalism. I'd been filing my first freelance stories for a newspaper I encountered while in Hunan, the Guangzhou
Morning Post, and then I flaked on the deadline to take the GRE for American journalism programs. I began looking for more permanent writing jobs in China, which is how I discovered a career portal on the University of Hong Kong website. So I applied, took an entrance exam and interviewed. The founder of the journalism center and dean at the time, Ying Chan, came to Shanghai to talk to the program's finalists. It felt more like a sales pitch-a good one, mind you-but I was still unsure what I would do. My mom called not long after I got in to say she and dad supported me and encouraged that I go, so I did.
I consider Hong Kong an extremely diverse city, and I could have picked a place surrounded by Europeans and Americans to live. But even then, some classmates and I found a neighborhood that was relatively less expensive and near school. Sai Ying Pun was very Chinese populated and also on a steep hill- I'd often get to and from public transit by taking escalators up and down local fish markets. I liked the neighborhood so much that I remained after graduating, finding a one-bedroom apartment near the top of the hill and commuting downtown for work.
I love Hong Kong, and for a long time, I called it a second home until
I realized I couldn't afford to go back. I miss it, and likewise, I miss train trips to Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Harbin and Beijing. That life offered such extreme variation in experience and culture, something I often took for granted and struggled to adjust to. Ultimately, though, a piece of me missed home too much, and I returned after three years abroad.
A family friend offered me a room in San Francisco. She lived on 18th and Noriega, and immediately I felt at home with a Chinese dessert shop a block away. I moved a couple times in the next year, first down the street to 35th Avenue, then over to ""mid"" Sunset near 18th and Lincoln, where I have lived in the same apartment the last 10 years. I get my hair cut at ""Salon de Hong Kong"" (2100 Irving St.), and my favorite sandwiches in The City come from an Asian- owned ""Uncle Benny's Donut and Bagel."" (2049 Irving St.)
I mentioned my journey the other day to my hairdresser, and she told me that after living in Sunset 28 years, ""I don't feel like I live in America."" I feel the same many days, I told her, but also that I had considered moving elsewhere in light of the pandemic, and because rents finally began falling. Still, it was hard to consider leaving somewhere that I'd become so comfortable living in, I said. ""Maybe this is home for you,"" she told me. And it is.
Westerners are often fascinated and surprised by my journey to San Francisco- it isn't every day a Northern California suburban bumpkin moves halfway around the world just because. More often though, the comment is more incredulity: ""Wow, China, what was that like?"" followed by a stream of racially distasteful commentary about Chinese people's supposed lack of manners or hygiene. These are broad-based remarks that many people fully believe about a country they have often never visited, and who may not have any close Asian friends.
China in particular is almost comical to me in the way people routinely just-and let's not mince words-bash it. Certain friends imitate Chinese accents, while others talk about how cheap they are, and for at least several years if not more, there's this weird attack on Chinese- and overseas-made products for not being locally made or high quality. I say ""weird"" because many people around me know what Foxconn is and that their phones and other devices come from a factory in Shenzhen. And likewise, almost everyone I know has an Amazon Prime account. I realize the other word is ""hypocritical.""
I could go on, and it's hard to avoid at least mentioning the gay community and its persistent so-called ""preferences"" that exclude some minorities-and especially Asian men-when they date and hook up. I could write 10,000 words on so many topics said just now, but suffice to say on this one: I think preferences are real. I also think you can leave race out when expressing them, and you can thoughtfully consider what influenced you to have those preferences in the first place.
""Stop Asian Hate"" is a movement we're talking about now because six Asian women were gunned down in an Atlanta spa. The circumstances are grim, disheartening, and sadly unsurprising in a country where our last president stoked the fire by calling COVID the ""China- virus,"" which encouraged what looked to me to be a bipartisan blame toward Wuhan on the entire global pandemic.
The women killed came from a diverse background, not just China- I'm writing about that country specifically because that's been my personal experience. With ""Stop Asian Hate"" though, I focused on the word ""hate"" rather than ""violence."" The movement sparked within me these long-held bitter feelings I've felt about so many people around me who are supposedly progressive, but carry these racial biases as if it's common and fine. It isn't.
If you're reading this column for the first time today, I am supposed to write about local cocktails and nightlife. So I'm sorry-but just a little bit-that I took such a sharp turn into rant territory. I hope you've reached out with kindness to Asian friends recently, and if you don't have any, go make one today. Support your Asian businesses. Be thoughtful of how you treat others.
I end today with a Chinese Mai Tai, which I first experienced at Li Po Cocktail Lounge (916 Grant Ave.) many years ago. They're closed now, so I found this recipe in an archived story from 2012 that the San Francisco Examiner did on their famous cocktail. You better believe I'll write a fresh profile of them once they reopen.

"PITTSBURGH'S ASIAN COMMUNITY FEARS HARASSMENT, VIOLENCE","Schackner, B.",Others,2021-03-19,"Christina Ong, a doctoral student at the University of Pittsburgh, has never been harassed on the street herself, but reading about the rise of anti-Asian incidents nationally made her nervous in recent months to leave her Bloomfield apartment alone.
""I left my house maybe once every two weeks, and that really impacted my physical and mental health,"" she said Thursday.
""I generally think I am a really optimistic person and enjoy being around people, but I have these underlying worries that people are perceiving me in a certain way. I am wearing a mask, but they still can tell I'm Asian. So is there going to be retribution?""
Even before a deadly mass shooting Tuesday in Atlanta drew public outrage, fear had been quietly building for months in cities, including Pittsburgh, where thousands of Asians and Asian Americans live, work and study on its campuses.
Irrational rhetoric blaming them for the COVID-19 pandemic, some spread on social media, has added to what some see as a more deeply rooted bias against Asians.
The suspect in the Atlanta attacks told investigators he wanted to eliminate a source of his sexual addiction, police said. But after months of escalating incidents, some violent, it was not lost on many in the general public that six of the eight people killed in multiple massage parlor attacks were women of Asian descent.
Agencies, including the FBI and Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, to lawmakers and advocacy groups around the country say they are monitoring the string of incidents.
""The lethal wave of xenophobia and racism towards the [Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders] community calls the 'Beloved Community' to lock arms in unity to denounce these acts,"" commission Executive Director Chad Dion Lassiter said.
Moved by mounting incidents, Penn State University officials this month reiterated earlier assurances from school President Eric Barron to international students and others, including those of Asian descent.
""You are welcome here,"" he wrote. ""Your presence enriches our university and the educational experience of all of our students.""
A daily fear
Ms. Ong, 28, whose grandparents are from China, is from Sacramento, Calif. She is studying sociology and also works as a researcher for the Asian American Pacific Islander COVID-19 project. As such, she has heard firsthand stories of Asian Americans who have been the victims of harassment. She said women are more likely than men to be harassed in the street, while blue-collar and older individuals are more visible and thus vulnerable.
The problem is affecting behaviors as routine as grocery shopping.
""In conducting interviews with people across the country for this project, I've heard stories of people saying like, 'Yeah, well, when I'm in the grocery store, I, like, have to run to an aisle that's empty because I don't want to cough or sneeze around other people,' "" Ms. Ong said.
She shares an apartment in Bloomfield but moved home to Sacramento in August, in part because she did not own a car and did not want to rely on a bus or walking, especially these days.
According to U.S. census data, 57,000 Asians reside in the eight counties surrounding Pittsburgh, all but about 10,000 of them in Allegheny County.
Not a new problem
A little over a year ago, there were just 12 confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S., according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. None of those was in Pennsylvania.
Even so, Asian and Asian American students were already facing xenophobia and racism, Marian Lien, president of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Organization of Chinese Americans, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at the time. She could not immediately be reached Thursday.
Classmates asked one college student to put on a mask to attend class, even though the student had not recently been to China. Another said dormmates had asked her to move to a single room, Ms. Lien said.
Businesses were affected, too, including one Chinese restaurant owner who said profits at the time were 50% below normal.
Following the Atlanta attack earlier this week, Pitt's Asian Studies Center posted to its website a strong condemnation:
""Because the victims are Asian, this act of violence, following on other acts in different parts of the country, produces a threat that is profoundly serious and deeply felt by our community of students, faculty and staff,"" it read in part.
Joseph Alter, the center's director, said he has not heard of any high-profile cases of harassment in Pittsburgh. But he said social media vitriol against Asians and cases of violence against Asians in other parts of the country has led to a general sense of anxiety.
""There's a palpable sense of fear and anxiety amongst the community that we represent,"" he said.
""If you are driving to a neighborhood that is new and unfamiliar, and you stop at a red light and a car pulls up next to you, you don't know what they're thinking. But you think that they may be thinking about everything that is circulating through social media,"" he explained.
""And so it's incredibly demoralizing. And it produces this kind of pervasive sense of stress.""
Ms. Ong said Asian men and women are often discriminated against in distinct ways.
""Asian men are racialized as emasculated, and that's super harmful to their psyche,"" she said. ""Asian women are racialized generally as like exotic or like sexual objects, essentially, which is what the Atlanta shooting really exemplifies.""
She added, ""I think there might be this misconception that once everyone's vaccinated, when things are back to in person, like all that hate rhetoric will go away. But we know that's not true.""

Board of Supervisors denounces racial hate crimes,"Cabral, A.",Others,2021-03-06,"The Monterey County Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a resolution denouncing hate crimes and
rhetoric against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
The move was made in response to the growing amount of hate crimes, harassment and discrimination that
Asian and Pacific Islander (API) Americans are facing, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""When we document hate, when we go ahead and shine a light on an issue like this, we remind the generations
that come after us that we didn't stand for it at the time, that we spoke up, we said something,"" Supervisor
Chris Lopez said. ""That's critically important.""
In 2020, the Stop Asian American Pacific Islander Hate Reporting Center reported over 2,800 hate incidents
against API Americans. Physical assaults make up 9% of these incidents, while potential civil rights violations,
such as workplace discrimination, made up 8% of these incidents, according to the center's website.
The resolution states: ""The Monterey County Board of Supervisors, on behalf of the County and all residents
thereof, denounce hate crimes, hateful rhetoric and hateful acts against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders,
and reaffirm our commitment to ensure that API Americans feel safe and welcome, both during this COVID-19
pandemic and beyond.""
Recent attacks were reported in Oakland and San Francisco, not far from Monterey County.
On Jan. 30, 84-year-old Vicha Ratanapakdee died after he was attacked while walking in San Francisco. The
incident was deemed a hate crime. On Jan. 31, three elderly Asian Americans were assaulted in Oakland's
Chinatown District.
Jeff Uchida, who is a part of the Japanese American Citizens League of Monterey Peninsula, thanked the board
for being early in taking a stand in California, noting that people must work together to prevent any more
violence and racism in Monterey County.
""We've seen some of the videos of the horrendous attacks against Asian Americans that have occurred, but we
need to have leaders step forward and truly denounce just the terribleness and how it affects our communities,""
Uchida said.
A county clerk will send copies of the resolution to Gov. Gavin Newsom, U.S. Senators Alex Padilla and Dianne
Feinstein and other elected officials.
Supervisor Luis Alejo also noted that Feb. 19 was the Day of Remembrance for Executive Order 9066, which
ordered the imprisonment of over 120,000 Japanese-Americans during World War II.
""It's important to be proactive, to not forget the lessons of the past and teach our youth these lessons and
these important messages that we stand united,"" he said. ""I think as elected officials, we send a strong
message throughout the county that these [incidents] are unacceptable.""
Supervisor Mary Adams said she has friends who were sent to the internment camps during World War II,
including one who was born there.
""That it even existed is such a scar on our entire country,"" Adams said. ""I think it's really important for us to
have the opportunity to think about those things specifically at times like this when the possibility of similar
crimes happening again is just horrendous.""

Asian- American women call for action: Indiana group sounds alarm on hate crimes,None,Others,2021-03-19,"Days before a shooting in Atlanta that left eight people dead, six of them Asian women, Asian American and Pacific Islander women sounded the alarm in Indiana.
""This is something people need to recognize,"" Ariana Cavallini said. ""These hate incidents, this white supremacy is hurting us. It's happening across the country and it's happening locally to Asian Americans.""
A suspect was arrested and charged with murder and assault after shootings at three Atlanta-area spas on Tuesday.
Local law enforcement stated the suspect has said his alleged actions were not motivated by race, but anti-Asian harassment and hate crimes have surged to more than 3,000 nation-wide in the past year. The incidents are tied to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and many were violent.
These events have ignited some Asian Hoosiers, many of whom have long felt invisible and not heard, to speak out and advocate on behalf of others in their community about the discrimination and racism Asians are facing and have been facing for years.
And they want Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb to act.
""It's unfortunate that it had to take death and murder,"" Cavallini said, ""for people to start listening to us.""
The 24-year-old Filipino American Hoosier is a member of the Indiana Chapter of the National Asian Pacific Islander Women's Forum (NAPAWF), a group based in Indianapolis and Bloomington founded last year to meet the needs of Asian American and Pacific Islander women, girls, and the community.
The group, which also locally and nation-wide works to make an impact on public policy to drive systemic change, gathered nearly 2,000 signatures in a petition from Asian Hoosiers, community leaders and allies asking Holcomb to establish an Asian American and Pacific Islander statewide advisory committee that can help address issues such as racism, discrimination, language access, health care resources and legal help, among others.
The petition, which was delivered to the governor on March 11, also asks Holcomb to implement programs and resources to support the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities in Indiana without escalating law enforcement and to condemn these hate crimes publicly.
As of Thursday, the group had not gotten a response from the governor's office on the petition or guidance about how to move forward with an advisory committee.
On Wednesday, during a weekly COVID-19 press conference Holcomb spoke on anti-Asian hate crimes after a journalist asked him what he thought about the incident in Atlanta and the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes but he didn't address the petition.
""There is no place for it,"" he said. ""Not just in Indiana, but in the country.""
Anti-Asian hate crimes
In an emailed statement to IndyStar, Holcomb referenced Indiana's hate crimes bill, which he signed in 2019. The bill allows judges to consider bias when handing down criminal sentences based on a victim's real or perceived traits. That includes skin color, creed, disability, national origin, race, religion and sexual orientation.
The bill excludes gender, gender identity and age.
""Anyone that seeks to terrorize or cause fear needs to be held accountable for that. Racism is counter to Hoosier values. It's not what we stand for,"" he said in the statement. ""There is no higher priority than the safety and security of Hoosiers.""
Nationwide Asian women are targets of anti-Asian racism more often than men. According to a report by Stop AAPI Hate, women made up 68% of the reports, compared to men, who made up 29%.
Although there's no data yet available about the total of anti-Asian harassment incidents in Indiana, according to NAPAWF, some incidents have been documented in Plymouth, Chesterton, Martinsville and Mooresville.
The Anti-Defamation League tracked increases in white supremacist hate propaganda activity. In 2020, 57 such incidents were reported in Indiana, which is a 24% increase from 46 incidents in 2019.
'We are not OK'
Sunny Shuai, 44, said Asian Hoosiers have been scared to go out in public since the pandemic started due to the rise in discrimination.
Shuai immigrated from China and has been calling Indiana home for more than two decades.
""People tend to think that we're fine, that Asians are fine because we tend to stay quiet because we don't speak up as often as others, but we are not OK,"" she said. ""We have lived in fear for so long. We love the United States, this is our home but now we don't feel safe.""
Some Asian Hoosiers believe more outreach from elected officials and law enforcement is needed to build trust and prevent more fear from spreading in the community
Liz Prevot, 35, of Greenwood said Asian Hoosiers deserve to feel protected.
""As we watch these hate crimes go up, not only an advisory council is needed but we should be able to get to know our police officers and to understand what our rights are,"" Prevot said. ""We should be able to trust our police officers and we need to be working with them.""
According to Census data, Asian Hoosiers make up nearly 4% of Marion County's population and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Hoosiers make up less than 1%.
The population has grown in some Indianapolis suburbs and surrounding counties.
Asian Hoosiers make up 6% of Hamilton County's population, 7% of Monroe County's and 4% of Johnson County's population.
Statewide, Asian Hoosiers make up nearly 3% of the population. And according to the Migration Policy Institute, 34% of immigrants living in Indiana in 2019 were Asian.
Gurinder Hohl, who is the CEO of the Immigrant Welcome Center in Indianapolis, said there's a lack of awareness in the community about the injustice Asian Americans have faced through the years.
""The systemic racism that exists in our country needs to be addressed,"" Hohl said. ""We need to acknowledge that, and we need to keep telling the stories of these injustices the Asian communities are facing.""
Acknowledging the contributions of immigrants and Asian American and Pacific Islander Hoosiers could be a step forward, she said.
""We need to have conversations in the community,"" Hohl said, ""and create a space where they feel welcome and that's where elected officials can play a big role.""

"Concerns raised about hate crimes Asian Americans in Central Florida speak out after spa shooting, anti-Chinese sentiment","Chen, A., & Stennett, D.",Others,2021-03-22,"Albert Harris-Russell was pumping gas at a station across from the Orange County Jail when a stranger confronted him and yelled ""F- the Chinese.""
It was mid-July, and it had become routine to hear former President Donald Trump and other Republican leaders refer to the coronavirus pandemic as the ""China virus"" or ""Kung flu"" even after the phrases had been decried as racist.
The man continued with his xenophobic tirade, also referring to COVID-19 as the ""China virus"" until Harris-Russell cut him off, telling the stranger he was Vietnamese, not Chinese. At the same time, he said the man noticed the National Guard logo on Harris-Russell's license plate. The man apologized and walked away.
""I can't imagine if I was Chinese what could have happened to me,"" he said. ""He could have gotten physical.""
Harris-Russell shared the story publicly for the first time after a series of shootings at three Atlanta spas left eight people dead, including six Asian-American women. Though the shooting has not been officially deemed a hate crime, it heightened the awareness of racially-motivated violence against Asian Americans.
Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition that tracks different forms of hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United 
States reported nearly 3,800 incidents nationwide since the start of the pandemic.
Though local law enforcement agencies say there has not been a spike in violence against Asian Americans, the data from Stop AAPI Hate show that the vast majority of incidents recorded were verbal attacks, deliberate avoidance and online harassment, actions unlikely to be reported to police.
Since the Atlanta attack, Central Florida residents - descendants of China, Vietnam, Korea, Laos, the Philippines and Taiwan - have opened up about harassment that has largely not escalated to physical violence but made them feel less safe in recent months.
'I don't feel as safe'
Tai Hai Le said a stranger yelled racial slurs at him both in Orlando near the beginning of the pandemic and while he was traveling through a Texas airport.
Minkyung Chung, a mental health counselor who recently moved from Central Florida to Atlanta, said her family questioned if it was safe to leave home with masks - before Orange County made masks mandatory - for fear of harassment.
Dustin Sundara said he hasn't been attacked personally, but as a long-time gun owner, he bought a smaller one to conceal carry more often.
""If you look Asian in general you can be seen as a target,"" Sundara said. ""Personally, I don't feel as safe. A lot of us are technically American. We work here. We pay taxes. Logically and rationally it doesn't make sense because we are all American.""
Adrian Lee, a University of Central Florida junior and president of the Asian Pacific American Coalition, described an incident this year when another UCF student said he was approached late at night and asked if he was Vietnamese and if he had coronavirus.
""It's easy to brush away,"" said Lee of the incident that might seem minor if it isn't taken into context with the violence that has erupted against Asian Americans across the country.
""You really have to look at these incidents as a pattern in the way the pandemic has been racialized,"" she said.
Lee helped plan a vigil for 6:30 p.m. Tuesday on the University of Central Florida campus to honor the victims.
A legacy of anti-Asian discrimination
Investigators say accused shooter Robert Aaron Long, who is white, told police a sex addiction, not race, motivated the killings.
Still, Ryan Buyco, an Asian-American studies professor at Colorado College said the Atlanta incident is part of a centuries-long legacy of anti-Asian discrimination, sexism and sexualization.
""These attacks towards Asians and Asian Americans are new for a lot of us...but we have to understand they aren't new, and they are part of a longer history of anti-Asian racism in the United States,"" he said.
""It's not just the shooter in Atlanta, but also the murder of Vincent Chin,"" Buyco said, referencing the killing of a Chinese-American man who was beaten to death in Michigan in 1982.
""It goes back to the incarceration of Japanese Americans and to the [Chinese] exclusion laws [of the late 1800s],"" he added.
The Page Act of 1875, specifically barred Chinese women from entering the country, because of the assumption that they were prostitutes and would ""infect"" the morality of white men, said Buyco.
""The shooting in Atlanta speaks to the sexist and racist history towards Asian women in particular, given that the suspect blamed his crime on his sexual addiction,"" said Buyco. ""Seeing these women not as people, but as sources of temptation, draws from long-standing stereotypes against Asian women as hypersexualized and subservient to men.""
For Le, who was twice verbally harassed since the start of the pandemic, he wants better treatment and more empathy for other Asian Americans.
""I hope that others can be mindful of the hardships and struggles that many Asian Americans face because of the boundaries systematically set in the United States that work against people of color,"" he said.

Asian Americans in Hawaii grieve attack in Atlanta,"Ordonio, C.",Others,2021-03-20,"When Sandy Ma, 50, read the news of the fatal shootings at three massage parlors in Atlanta, she worried about her family members who reside there. 
Ma, who is Chinese and a downtown Honolulu resident, called them the next day. Their response: “Yeah, they’ve always hated us.” 
The news broke Tuesday with reports of a white man who shot at three massage parlors and left eight dead, most of them Asian women. The names of the slain individuals were disclosed Friday: Soon Park, 74; Hyun Grant, 51; Suncha Kim, 69; Yong Yue, 63; Xiaojie Tan, 49; Daoyou Feng, 44; Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; and Paul Andre Michaels, 54. 
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, anti- Asian American hate incidents have grown significantly across the U.S. 
Hawaii is more than 4,400 miles away from Atlanta, which is where Ma grew up. She said even though Hawaii and the mainland have different cultures and attitudes, racism can happen anywhere. 
She reflected on the challenges her parents faced while immigrating from Taiwan to the U.S. in the 1960s while raising a family. She emphasized that many immigrants traveling to the U.S. longed for the “American dream.” 
“They wanted to come to this country so badly because it is their dream,” Ma said. “Because they know if you can work hard, you can achieve anything. Not just for yourself, but for your kids to make it. But to be vilified and not wanted is just unfathomable.” 
Hawaii’s anti-Asian sentiment 
Asian Americans — comprising Japanese, Chinese, Koreans, Filipinos and more — make up the largest ethnic group in the state. 
Diverse as Hawaii is, it still has a history of anti-Asian incidents, such as the Japanese internment camps on Oahu during Word War II. 
Amy Agbayani, former ethnic-studies lecturer at the University of Hawaii, recalled the 1988 name change of UH’s Porteus Hall, which is now Saunders Hall. Stanley Porteus was a UH professor who made racist and misogynist comments in his research. 
“He would have horrible comments saying you can’t trust the Chinese or Japanese,” Agbayani said. “He also said Filipinos are unstable and they will never become American.” 
These anti-Asian sentiments are not only a part of Hawaii’s past. 
Recently, Kauai Police Chief Todd Raybuck faced backlash for making racist comments about an employee who was of Japanese decent. The Garden Island newspaper reported on an audio recording about what Raybuck said. 
In the recording, Raybuck said, “So, somebody in the Japanese culture, if they think your idea is absolutely stupid and the dumbest thing they’ve ever heard, what’s their typical response to you? Yes, yes, yes.” 
“He’s absolutely tone deaf if he doesn’t understand that people in Hawaii would be offended by these types of statements,” Agbayani said. “The people in Hawaii have experienced racism for centuries, and it’s easy for them to identify with the attack on the Asian Americans in Georgia. There’s also a history of white supremacy in the state. Many people of color have experienced racism.” 
Grieving but resilient 
AF3IRM Hawaii members Cu Ri Lee, 32, and Jasmine Pontillas Dave, 31, said they were not surprised about the violent event against Asian Americans in Atlanta. However, that did not stop them from grieving and then reflecting on what it means to be Asian American women. 
Af3IRM Hawaii is a local feminist group, organized by a diverse group of women. 
“The attacks were horrific but foreseeable,” said Lee, who is Korean. “We’ve normalized harmful stereotypes on Asians, specifically Asian women. Obviously, this isn’t new. We’ve seen this type of violence against Asians throughout American history. We’ve seen the yellow peril as the demise throughout society.” 
Both Lee and Dave grew up on Oahu. Both said that “violent acts against Asians” have happened in Hawaii. 
They added how they felt sexualized because of their ethnicities. Both have said they’ve been called exotic — particularity by white men in Hawaii. They emphasized how before the COVID-19 pandemic they never felt safe, and remain vigilant of their surroundings. 
Dave was appalled by the reason why the gunman targeted the massage parlors. She cited the fetishization of Asian women working in these businesses. 
“There’s a particularly disgusting stereotype that persists, and it’s the idea that Asian women are passive, submissive individuals who exist just to give men access to our bodies for sex and for labor,” she said. 
Dave is Filipino and Indian. 
“This was motivated by race,” Dave said, referring to the Atlanta shooting. 
“A white man felt that these Asian women are a form of temptation to him as if they were objects available for him to purchase and use, instead of seeing them as human beings.” 
Following the increased attacks on Asian Americans in the U.S., local organizations voiced their support to the Asian communities. 
The Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii released a statement Thursday addressing the incidents, citing that though Hawaii is a melting pot of ethnicities, that doesn’t mean racial discrimination doesn’t exist. 
Even the state Legislature passed resolutions condemning any type of xenophobia or anti-Asian sentiments — especially in Hawaii. 
There were 42 pages of written testimony supporting the resolutions. Ma was one of the testifiers at Thursday’s hearing and gave emotional testimony about her hometown. 
Despite the increase of Asian American hate incidents, Ma, Dave and Lee echoed the resilience of their communities. 
“Don’t let other people define you,” Ma said. “Just be unique. It’s OK to speak up and speak out.”

Advocates call on Canadians to examine treatment of Asian Canadians,None,Others,2021-03-19,"Amy Go says she was saddened by the shootings in Atlanta that left six Asian American women dead, but as an Asian Canadian women, she wasn't surprised.
Go, the president of the Chinese Canadian National Council for Social Justice, said many Asian Canadian women have experienced hatred or violence in their daily life.
""There's so much pain and grief,"" she said about her initial reaction to the attack. ""At the same time, as Asian Canadian women, none of us were surprised. There was no sense of shock. It was as if we knew this was coming … it just happened to be in Atlanta.""
The killings in Atlanta follow a wave of recent attacks against Asian Americans and Canadians since the novel coronavirus first arrived in North America.
In Atlanta, the 21-year-old suspect has denied his attack was racially motivated and claimed to have a ""sex addiction,"" with authorities saying he apparently saw massage parlours as sources of temptation.
The national council has tracked 931 anti-Asian racist incidents during COVID-19, and Go said the numbers should highlight myths about how Canadians view themselves.
""This myth about Canada that we are multicultural, more kind, we're gentler than Americans, to me that's just a myth. As racialized Canadians, particularly racialized women, we know that the reality is quite different,"" she said.
Federal Trade Minister Mary Ng, who was born in Hong Kong before moving to Canada when she was seven, said she's been the victim of discrimination.
""Every time I speak out about the need for us to keep working together as Canadians to prevent more intolerance and incidents of anti-Asian hate or discrimination, I will get a whole lot of other responses that are not becoming of Canadians,"" she said in an interview.
She said the news of Tuesday's attack left her feeling ""horrified"" and she emphasized the need for Canadians to offer support to the Asian Canadian community.
""I think the request is that Asian Canadians need all Canadians to stand alongside us, to speak out and to be vocal and to stand against anti-Asian racism and to certainly stand up for us in this fight,"" Ng said.
Police in major cities across Canada have recorded increases in hate crimes in the past year, although not all could identify the specific targets of the alleged crimes.
Vancouver police reported a 717 per cent increase in anti-Asian hate crimes between 2019 and 2020, with the incidents peaking in May. Incidents in Vancouver have ranged from assaults to racist graffiti targeting businesses.
Sgt. Steve Addison, a Vancouver police spokesman, said in an email that police do not have the ability to recommend hate crimes charges under the Criminal Code. It is a sentencing provision that is applied by the courts if a person is convicted of a Criminal Code offence, Addison said.
Toronto police said it has seen an increase in the number of hate-motivated occurrences, comparing 2019 with 2020 — including incidents against Asian people — but could not provide data.
Ottawa police reported an increase of 56.9 per cent in the number of hate crime reports between 2019 and 2020, and noted Asian Canadians have seen the largest increase in hate incidents directed toward them.
Henry Yu, an associate professor in the University of British Columbia's history department, said Asians have historically been blamed for a range of societal problems in Canada.
Yu cited the recent examples of people listing Chinese investment in Vancouver's real estate market as a reason they cannot afford homes or the racist stereotype of Asians as poor drivers as ways Canadians blame others.
""I'm not a sex worker, I'm not female, but it doesn't matter. The idea that Asians are blamed and scapegoated for societal problems that have nothing to do with us, that is what makes you feel insecure,"" he said.
Discrimination against Asians can be traced back to when Canada became a formal country in 1867, he said, pointing to examples like the head tax specifically targeting people of Asian origin.
""(Discriminatory legislation) went hand in hand with the founding of the country,"" he said.

"Coronavirus racism: Go back to China, attacker said, as he punched indigenous Vancouver woman who sneezed: Woman who sneezed on Vancouver street told to 'go back to China' before being punched in face","Young, Ian",Others,2020-05-21,"Dakota Holmes says she was walking her dog, Kato, through Gray's Park on Vancouver's Eastside at about 8.30pm on Friday when she sneezed.
She said she had just passed a man, who wheeled around and began berating her about Covid-19, yelling at her to ""go back to China"". As the abuse escalated - ""very negative comments [about] the coronavirus ... go home, you don't belong here"" - the man punched her in the head twice, knocking her to the ground.
Holmes, 27, is an indigenous Canadian.
""I've been in situations like this before, being indigenous,"" Holmes said. ""I try not to get involved. I try not to say anything back ... I think the only thing I said was 'I'm not Asian, I'm indigenous, I'm from here, I've been here my whole life'.""
Holmes' experience is not unique.
In Montreal, Inuit woman Sue Simigak said she was abused on the city's subway on April 4 by a man who similarly mistook her for being Chinese and told her to ""get out of my own country"". She posted pictures on Facebook showing a man giving her the finger from a subway platform.
Anti-racism activist Fo Niemi said indigenous people in Canada, particularly the Inuit, were often mistaken for Asians ""due to their physical features"".
The cases of Holmes and Simigak showed how racism could spread amid the pandemic, said Niemi, co-founder and executive director of the Montreal-based Centre for Research Action on Race Relations.
""Rising incidents and reports of anti-Asian racism and xenophobia can spread to other groups in Canada who look Asian, ranging from Inuit people to Latin Americans,"" Niemi said.
Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, president of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs, issued a statement in response to the attack on Holmes, who works at the organisation.
It said the union was ""disgusted"" by the incident and offered ""sympathy and solidarity to Asian communities who have borne the brunt of Covid-19 related racism"".
Holmes' case was being handled by the Vancouver Police Department's hate crimes investigators, spokesman Sergeant Aaron Roed said.
""Our initial investigation shows that a person was assaulted and this may have been related to race ... the victim did have minor physical injuries and did not need medical treatment the night of the incident,"" Roed said.
No arrests have been made, and police were seeking witnesses to the incident, Roed said. Holmes said her attacker was a Caucasian man, about 180cm tall and weighing about 90kg, wearing a hat and a dark jumper.
She said the man had passed her from the opposite direction and was about two metres behind her when she sneezed because of her seasonal allergies. He immediately started shouting abuse.
""When I turned around to face him, he started coming at me, yelling in my face and then he punched me, in the jaw, and then above my eye, my temple area,"" she said.
Holmes said she fell to the ground, but felt she was saved from worse by Kato, a 45kg Dogo Argentino that Holmes adopted three years ago. Kato started biting at the man's ankles.
The man responded by threatening to have authorities confiscate Kato because the dog was ""being aggressive"". With Kato straining at the end of his leash, the man eventually ran off.
Holmes returned to her nearby home and called her father, Don Bain - a special adviser to British Columbia Premier John Horgan - who calmed her down. An hour later she called the police and met them back at the park.
   Niemi said a wave of anti-Asian racism linked to the coronavirus had caught many places unprepared.
Traditional responses to tackle racism ""do not always work effectively with Asian communities"", said Niemi, because of cultural, social and language factors ""which led many Asians not to talk openly about racism, much less reporting racist acts"".
In Vancouver, police have warned of a recent spike in hate crimes amid the pandemic. Before the attack on Holmes, there had been 20 anti-Asian hate crimes reported this year - 16 of them in March and April - compared with 12 in all of 2019.
Incidents in Vancouver have included a 92-year-old man surnamed Kwong who was assaulted and thrown out of a 7-Eleven store by a customer, and an Asian woman wearing a face mask who was punched in the face by another pedestrian.
Authorities have also noted the phenomenon. Horgan condemned ""disturbing stories of a rise in anti-Asian racist behaviour since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic"", adding that ""racism is also a virus"".
Henry Shuen Ngei Yu, a history professor at the University of British Columbia, said the attack on Holmes could not properly be understood as simply about ""mistaken identity"".
""Why do we think this is a case of mistaken identity?"" asked Yu. ""White supremacy historically has relied on defining non-white 'races' as abstract categories that generally are not coherent ... we should pause whenever we begin to think that something has gone awry in situations like this, as if, if the target had actually been 'correctly' identified as Chinese that we should be somehow less perturbed because it somehow made sense,"" Yu said.
Holmes said she had previously been mistaken for being Asian ""but not like this"".
""The only reason I'm sharing this story is that racism is not OK. If anyone else experiences something like this they should speak out. We're all in this together.""",5302
Asian communities in the US calls on support against hate and racism,None,Others,2020-05-29,"A joint statement released on May 25 calls for solidarity against hate and racism against Asian communities in the US. The statement is signed by more than 100 prominent writers, artists, actors, and creative professionals. Many of them are Americans with Asian origins.
The statement is followed by a day-long event of online panel discussions hosted by Pen America and Asian American Writers’ Workshops on May 27. Panelists including college professors, writers and journalists drew attention on hostility mindset and behaviors after the COVID-19 pandemic, asking people to “speak out and fight hate”.
The statement refers to a report released by ADL, an organization watch for bias, discrimination and hate around the world. The report listed more than 100 anti-Asian incidents reported in the media and by victims since January. The attacks have happened in college campuses, city subways and online. Many individuals being spit on, stabbed, beat up, or verbally assaulted.
One incident reported by the Daily Beast is that a man from Myanmar and his two children, ages six and two, were attacked and stabbed at a Sam’s Club by a 19-year-old man in Texas on March 14. The alleged assailant admitted to targeting the family because he believed the family was Chinese and infecting people with coronavirus.
ADL points out that the list is still not comprehensive, but it is clear that these are not just isolated incidents. The anti-Asian sentiment is on rise, in both scale and quantity.
According to a recent Ipsos poll among Americans, 32% of them have witnessed someone blaming Asian people for COVID-19 and 24% would be concerned about coming in close contact with someone of Asian origins. With such an alarming proportion, things could be out of control if unchecked.
“They have been egged on at times by an administration drawing on racist tropes and stereotypes, eager to distract from its own missteps,” claims the statement. It highlights that public officials and leaders in the US have not taken sufficient steps to address such attacks, and in some cases are promoting theories that blame Asian people for the coronavirus pandemic.
“We, the undersigned, call on everyday citizens to join us in standing in solidarity with all those targeted by hate during COVID-19,” said the statement, “The time to turn back this wave of hate is now.”",2351
"Asian heritage month good time to eradicate anti-Asian rhetoric; Racism, hate crimes on the rise amid pandemic lockdown","Baranyai, Robin",Others,2020-05-16,"People can get a bit insular during a crisis. Their focus pulls inward, drawing a circle around their families and loved ones. The hardships of others tend to recede to the periphery. But this narrowed view can get ugly when the focus shifts to laying blame; too often, people who are ""othered"" bear the brunt.
May is Asian heritage month and, in an unpleasant irony, anti-Asian hate crimes and online rhetoric are on the rise. The confluence of these opposing events inspired Vancouver dancer and choreographer Ziyian Kwan to organize a peaceful dance action earlier this week. She chose a space outside the Chinese Cultural Centre, which in April was vandalized with racist graffiti.
Kwan told CBC's Early Edition she was verbally accosted while visiting the site. ""Take your bike back where you came from,"" a stranger shouted. ""You people made this up in Wuhan City and now you've brought it here to Canada.""
There's a lot to unpack in this brief, angry tirade: the myth (dispelled by scientists) the virus was manufactured in a lab; the conflation of Chinese government actions with Asian heritage; the hideous notion of ethnicity as a disease vector. But there can be little confusion how and where the seeds of these falsehoods were planted, and how widely they're taking root.
China's government is under legitimate and mounting scrutiny for its early handling of the virus, including from Canada's ambassador to Beijing. But the country has become the favoured scapegoat for politicians looking to distract from their own critical failures, and fire up a nationalistic voting base.
The administration of U.S.
President Donald Trump is pushing an attack narrative against the findings of its own intelligence community. The words of the Vancouver assailant, which so shook Kwan, might as well have been crafted in the U.S. Oval Office, where on May 6 the U.S. president told reporters: ""It could have been stopped in China. It should have been stopped at the source, and it wasn't.""
Not one to miss an opportunity for hyperbole, he further asserted: ""This is worse than Pearl Harbor. This is worse than the World Trade Center. There's never been an attack like this.""
A Republican election strategy based on attacking China is spelled out in a 57-page memo from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which was leaked to Politico, a U.S. political journal. Several candidates are going all-in.
One poisonous election ad for Florida Congressional candidate Casey Askar states: ""China unleashed the Wuhan pandemic on the world, costing trillions, costing jobs, costing American lives.""
Another, for Texas candidate Kathaleen Walsh, depicts the ""Chinese virus"" sailing toward the U.S. ""China is a criminal enterprise masquerading as a sovereign nation,"" the ad alleges. ""It's time to fight back.""
It's important to ask what this strategy achieves, and at what cost. Racist messaging has proved an effective way to fire up Trump's base. And red herrings about the Wuhan lab also are fuel for conspiracy theorists, whose dependable circulation of misinformation plays an essential role in undermining democracy.
We've even seen this tactic floated in Canadian politics. In April, rookie MP and Conservative leadership candidate Derek Sloan turned on Canada's chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, asking: ""Does she work for Canada or for China?"" Tam responded, with dignity, she would not be distracted by ""noise.""
Unfortunately, the noise is taking a toll. A poll conducted the same week in Canada's largest cities, by the Chinese Canadian National Council for Social Justice, found roughly one in seven respondents either thought all Chinese or Asian people carried COVID-19, or they weren't sure.",3712
Liberal journalists cry wolf over Trump ‘racism’ toward Asian American reporter,"Polumbo, Brad",Others,2020-05-12,"President Trump has certainly made some racist comments during his time in politics. But his abrupt dismissal of CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang at Monday evening’s press conference isn’t one of them. Of course, that didn’t stop liberal journalists en masse from trying to make the story themselves, baselessly crying racism for the billionth time. As always, they fail to appreciate that they are diluting the charge for whenever it is actually warranted.
Here’s the exchange that prompted so much outcry.
Jiang asked Trump an antagonistic question, as is her right, demanding that he explain why he views coronavirus testing as a “global competition” and questioning his motives while “everyday Americans are losing their lives.”
Trump responded, “Well, they’re losing their lives everywhere in the world. And maybe that’s a question you should ask China. Don’t ask me. Ask China that question. ... You may get a very unusual answer.”
Then, Trump tried to move on, but Jiang interjected again and asked, “Sir, why are you saying that to me, specifically?” The reporter’s follow-up question and intonation were clearly meant to accuse the president of racism, as she is an Asian American. Apparently, the thought didn’t cross her mind that Trump may have said that to her “specifically” because she was the one who asked him the question.
“I’m not saying it specifically to anybody. ... I’m saying it to anyone that would ask a nasty question like that,” Trump replied. A bit more discord ensued, and when the gaggle of reporters wouldn’t move on, Trump abruptly ended the press conference and stormed out.
You can watch the full exchange for yourself below:Trump Press Conference
Naturally, liberal journalists decided to take an incident that otherwise may have reflected on the president somewhat poorly merely for his lack of decorum and suffer an unhinged meltdown trying without basis to make Trump’s deflection a racist attack on an Asian American journalist.
CNN’s Brian Stelter immediately cried racism, saying shortly after this incident, on-air, that “what we saw in that exchange with Weijia Jiang was something that has racial overtones. It's racist to look at an Asian American White House correspondent and say, 'Ask China.'” He was one of many left-wing journalists to jump to this charge, with his CNN colleague Wolf Blitzer calling the president’s behavior “very ugly.”
And here’s just a small sample of the truly unhinged pity party that quickly descended on left-wing social media, as #WeijiaJiang trended:TweetTweetTweetTweet
Trump has been laying blame for the coronavirus pandemic on China and on its regime since day one of the crisis. Rightly or wrongly, he has time and time again deflected criticism of his administration’s decision-making by pivoting to China. All he did this time was do this once again in response to essentially the same question as always — but this time coming from an Asian American reporter.
No one deserves to be demeaned or insulted for his or her race or ethnicity. Trump did not do this to Jiang, and the reaction to this has been utterly ridiculous.",3106
Two comedians reshape their acts during lockdown,None,Others,2020-05-26,"Life is funny, even when it isn’t. It’s a conundrum that confronts comedians every day.
Except right now, the challenge is a bit more complicated: A public health crisis. An economic crisis. And no live shows.

For bilingual comedians Joanna Hausmann and Joe Wong, there’s another challenge: Their audiences aren’t just in the United States. They are two bilingual performers whose comedy is being reshaped by the events of this year.
Joanna Hausmann: Family as support - and material
Hausmann was raised in Venezuela and lives in New York. She’s known for a series of videos about differences between Latin American countries. She’s also a correspondent on Netflix’s “Bill Nye Saves the World.” Right before the pandemic struck New York City, she left for Massachusetts to stay with her parents, “isolated from any other human being other than my family.”
And so, her family has become the subject of her quarantine videos.
Hausmann actually can’t imagine going through the pandemic without having family around. In Latin America, it’s the norm.
“Back home in Venezuela, the people that are with the most amount of family members are doing the best. Those that are the most isolated are not doing so great.”
Joanna Hausmann, comedian
“Back home in Venezuela, the people that are with the most amount of family members are doing the best,” she said. “Those that are the most isolated are not doing so great.”
At her parents’ house, Hausmann doesn’t have the professional crew she normally works with. So, she’s enlisted her younger cousin who’s learning on the fly how to edit video. The realization that her work doesn’t need to be perfect has been liberating for her.

“There’s no reason why I shouldn't post that video that I shot on an iPhone,” she said. “Or that weird front-facing video of my mom yelling at me a hundred times in Spanish,

She has many other quarantine videos, like this:
Joe Wong: Tackling coronavirus-related racism
Staying at home has been more of a challenge for Joe Wong. He’s mainly a stand-up comedian, feeding off live audiences. Recently, he appeared on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.”
Wong is a star not just here but in his native China, too, where he hosts a game show called, “Is it True?”
Related: Is the polyglot brain different? MIT researchers are trying to find out.
Wong was supposed to be recording a new season of “Is it True?” but it’s been postponed. Instead, he’s at home in Southern California. He has a 13-year-old, American-born son whom he’s trying to cook for.
“Kids are too honest. ... He's like, ‘Daddy, the chicken tastes like tofu.’ I'm like, what do you mean? That is tofu!”

“Kids are too honest,” Wong said of his son. “He's like, ‘Daddy, the chicken tastes like tofu.’ I'm like, what do you mean? That is tofu!”
“He's not happy with my cooking.”
Wong’s also doing some work online - Instagram Live, YouTube - but frankly, he isn’t doing much comedy. Instead, he’s using his platform to speak out against the recent spate of virus-related attacks on Asian Americans.
Wong’s new activism is rooted in his past experiences in the US, going back to his time as a graduate student in the 1990s.
“We had a foreign student adviser who told us the key to living in America is to be slow to take offense. Later on, I gradually realized that it was just a way to tell you not to speak up when you see something wrong.”

"Naperville officially denounces racism, moves toward inclusion","Wilson, Marie",Others,2020-05-23,"Naperville officially denounces racism, moves toward inclusion action steps A resolution is on the books and an action plan is in place celebrating diversity and denouncing all acts of racism, intolerance and discrimination in Naperville.
The steps come after several occasions of reported racist acts at schools, restaurants and gas stations in the city and after what the resolution calls an ""increase in anti-Asian sentiment across the country caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.""
City council members approved the resolution unanimously during a virtual meeting after hearing written comments from 10 residents and spoken statements from three others calling for public solidarity against racism. Speakers represented the Chinese, Japanese, Jewish and Latino communities.
""The most recent incidents concerning African Americans, and most recently, Asian American backlash, have sadly opened up new wounds, as I have felt that our city has been progressively moving toward greater acceptance of diversity,"" Naperville native Christine Simonson said in written comments read aloud during the meeting. ""As Naperville continues to become more diverse, I feel it is necessary for everyone to embrace and respect everyone’s differences.""
The council also unanimously approved recommendations that call for implicit bias training and diversity recruiting enhancements for city staff members, development of a human relations commission, and engagement with community groups to further equity and inclusion.
City council members thanked Chinese community leader Nancy Chen Chen — she reached out a month ago seeking a city denouncement of acts against Asian Americans — and city council member Benny White for his creation of an inclusive discussion group called Naperville Neighbors United.
""We applaud your leadership in standing up against racism in all forms,"" Lucy Chen, board chairwoman of the The United Chinese Americans Illinois Chapter, said in written comments.
Resident Karen Peck said in written comments she is ""saddened that such a resolution needs to be codified.""
But a few residents in written comments shared stories of what Simonson described as ""daily tormenting"" based on her race, or what Jennifer Chen called ""an ugly racial incident"" at a football game.
""As much as I loved and benefited from the Naperville I grew up in, I am sad to say that I can still recall every act of discrimination I witnessed in our school,"" Chen said in written comments. ""I do not wish these types of life lessons on any kid today. And that’s why this resolution — this commitment to our community, our kids, our families and our businesses — will continue to bolster Naperville’s strong reputation for being a place people choose to live.""
Mayor Steve Chirico said it was sad but important to hear stories of past discriminatory treatment. He called the resolution and action steps denouncing racism ""a long time coming.""
White encouraged everyone to follow intent of the city actions by speaking up when improper treatment occurs. ""Step up and say something about it,"" White said. ""Say, ‘Hey, not in my town.’""",3108
US city takes on bigots by denouncing words of hate,"Zhu, May",Others,2020-05-11,"The spread of the novel coronavirus is triggering hate against Asian Americans. One Texas city is trying to do something about it.
The San Antonio City Council unanimously passed a resolution on Thursday denouncing bigotry, anti-Semitism, crimes against Asian Americans and ""hateful speech"" amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
The resolution, proposed by Mayor Ron Nirenberg, states that ""COVID-19 is a public health issue, not a racial, religious or ethnic one, and the deliberate use of terms such as 'Chinese virus' or 'Kung Fu virus' to describe COVID-19 only encourages hate crimes and incidents against Asians and further spreads misinformation at a time when communities should be working together to get through this crisis"".
The resolution also says that the Jewish community has been targeted with blame and conspiracy theories regarding the disease.
""The City of San Antonio denounces anti-Semitism, anti-Asian bigotry, and all hateful speech, violent action and the spread of misinformation related to COVID-19 that casts blame, promotes racism or discrimination or harms the City of San Antonio Asian and Pacific Islander, Jewish, immigrant or other communities,"" the resolution says.
According to the Anti-Defamation League, or ADL, reports of xenophobic and racist incidents targeting members of the Asian-American and Pacific Islander, or AAPI, communities in the US have surged since January.
Those incidents include Asian Americans being told to ""Go back to China"", being blamed for ""bringing the virus"" to the US, being referred to with racial slurs, spat on, and in some extreme cases, being physically assaulted.
ADL compiled a list of anti-AAPI incidents that have been reported by media outlets across the country since January. The number of incidents is close to 100.
One of the most recent reports showed that in New York, an Asian man was attacked on the subway by a stranger who shouted at him, ""You're infected, China boy. You need to get off the train."" The assailant then grabbed the victim and attempted to pull him out of his seat.
Some comments regarding the report of San Antonio's new anti-hate speech resolution at ksat.com have been negative, indicating that such bias and discrimination are prevalent.
'Rather disheartening'
""It's rather disheartening to see such a large number of negative, angry, and downright crude comments that have appeared on local social media and news media websites since the passage of this resolution by the San Antonio City Council,"" said Jon Taylor, professor and department chair of the political science and geography department at the University of Texas at San Antonio.
""Calling people out for their hateful comments is a reminder that words can and do have meaning and consequences. Those opposed to this resolution don't see it quite that way and view it as an infringement of their free speech rights. And that's their right as Americans. But that doesn't mean that people can't be civil,"" Taylor said.
Steven Pei, a professor at the University of Houston and honorary chair of United Chinese Americans, or UCA said: ""We appreciate very much that the San Antonio City Council declared war against hate speeches such as 'Chinese virus' and 'Kung Fu flu' to ensure safety of the entire community.""
He pointed out that Asian Americans did not spread the virus; on the contrary, they have made great contributions to combat the virus by raising funds to donate personal protection equipment to medical workers, first responders and communities in need across the US.",3531
Hate-fuelled incidents against East Asians are on the rise,"Bailey, Ian; Hager, Mike",Others,2020-05-16,"Clara Kan and her mother were just beginning a seaside stroll last week in Richmond, B.C., when two men in a car hurled a racial slur at them and shouted: ""Go back to China.""
The women, who were wearing masks, confronted the driver, an older white man, who then revved the engine and lurched the car toward Ms. Kan before driving off.
Ms. Kan's 65-year-old mother screamed for help and the men drove off. Ms. Kan immediately reported the incident to the RCMP.
Since the altercation, she says, her mother is scared to resume their daily walks in public parks and only feels comfortable shopping at Chinese supermarkets, where the majority of other shoppers are East Asian.
Ms. Kan is adamant that she will never remain silent about the kind of abuse she, her mother and many other East Asian Canadians are facing.
""What concerns me most is a lot of Chinese people or Asian people they're like, ‘Oh, let it go, just walk away,' but I feel like maybe in a way because I was bold enough to confront these racists maybe that's why physical violence didn't occur,"" says Ms. Kan, 33.

Don't be distracted from real racism today,"Lo, Alex",Others,2020-05-15,"I am a fan of Bryan Adams, Donald Trump, not so much. Both men have recently said something impolitic that led to accusations of racism.
In both instances, some people may have been a tad too sensitive about minor offences when there is actually real violent racism against Asians in Western countries because of the coronavirus pandemic.
In the case of the Canadian rocker, I actually agree with what he said, though as a public figure, he might have made the same point with less extreme language. He has since apologised.
Originally, on Instagram, he said: ""[T]hanks to some (expletive) bat eating, wet market animal selling, virus making greedy b******s, the whole world is now on hold. My message to them other than ""thanks a (expletive) lot"" is go vegan."" Racist? Not at all. It's actually kind of true.
However, he should know that the Chinese government has now banned the trading and consumption of wildlife animals. It remains to be seen how successful Chinese enforcement of the new law will be.
Also, at least two Chinese cities - Zhuhai and Shenzhen - have banned the eating of cats and dogs. Hopefully, others will follow.
While I admire vegans, who refuse to eat any animal products at all, vegetarianism may be a less radical option for most people, as it allows them to eat dairy and eggs.
As for the US president, there is abundant evidence that he is a racist and a sexist. But that doesn't mean everything he says about non-whites and women are such.
When an Asian-American CBS reporter asked him about the death toll of the pandemic in the United States, he replied, ""Ask China."" Trump has been blaming China for months now, and that was the intention of his reply.
Somehow, the reporter was offended, thinking what he said had to do with her looking Asian. Quite a few others agreed with her.
On the great scale of things, having your question deflected by a racially insensitive president is rather minor compared to real racism.
While hard statistics are unavailable, a survey by the Asian-American Studies department at San Francisco State University found a 50 per cent increase in news stories about coronavirus-related discrimination and violent incidents from early February to early March in the US.

"Far from home, student draws on kindness to cope",DONG LESHUO,Others,2020-05-09,"Editor's note: This news column showcases stories from around the world that bring a touch of positivity to the fight against the deadly coronavirus.
Zou Yining, a second-year graduate student from China at Georgetown University, has found a way to stay positive during the COVID-19 pandemic - by helping others.
Zou, one of the hundreds of thousands of Chinese students in the United States, interns at a Washington DC think tank, the China Environment Forum, or CEF, at the Wilson Center. The organization focuses on plastics-related policy research and Zou works on the CEF website.
Recently, Zou received a package from the Chinese embassy in Washington that contained protective KN95 and surgical masks, medications, sanitizing wipes and a brochure to help Chinese students stay healthy in the US.
She also received a gift bag including fresh fruit and snacks from her supervisor, Jennifer Turner, director of the CEF, with a message expressing her hope that the interns stay strong amid the coronavirus pandemic.
""I was moved to tears a little as my heart was warmed by such care and solicitude, and by not feeling isolated and lonely anymore,"" Zou said.
""At the beginning of this pandemic, Jennifer asked me about the situation of my family and the city they live in, and she also wanted to make donations to Chinese people. My heart felt the warmth of her kindness and caring.""
Zou is grateful that she has a professional, friendly and active work environment, especially as discrimination toward Chinese in the US has been present since the outbreak began.
She said she felt depressed when she saw Chinese people and Asian Americans being subjected to racist attacks on Twitter.
""I think it's time for the two countries to come together instead of blaming each other. The US and China need more mutual cooperation on global challenges,"" said Zou.
She learned that some of her colleagues volunteered amid the pandemic.
""One of my colleagues made masks with her tiny sewing machine and then donated them to community workers, cleaners and couriers,"" Zou said. ""And another colleague, who preferred to cook at home before, decided to order takeout more frequently to support local restaurants.
""I felt really encouraged by their experiences and also wanted to support the people around me.""
Zou found the hospital closest to her, MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, and registered her donation information.
On April 28, Zou, with another classmate, donated all of her KN95 masks and three bags of disinfectant wipes to the hospital.
""At this time, I think front-line medical workers who are (more vulnerable to) COVID-19 should be protected more than us,"" Zou said. ""I feel really happy since I have an opportunity to contribute to the common good, even though I'm not that strong.""",2792
U.S. Asians push back on harassment,"Chang, Richard",Others,2020-05-30,"NEW YORK — A spike in harassment of Asian-Americans since the coronavirus pandemic began has led community activists in the United States to fight back — forming street patrols, rallying on social media, and supporting each other online.
Asians of varying national backgrounds have suffered a surge of attacks this year, which activists linked to the pandemic's emergence in China. Some said they feared harassment could worsen in a U.S. election year, with U.S.- China tensions ratcheting up over trade, Hong Kong and the coronavirus.
""When China is made the enemy, people who look like Chinese are the enemy. The economy is tanking, people are dying. They're angry and fearful and want to take it out on Asian Americans even more,"" said Russell Jeung, professor of Asian-American studies at San Francisco State University.
Since March 19, over 1,800 cases of harassment related to the coronavirus pandemic have been reported to Stop AAPI Hate, a website Jeung created with two advocacy groups.
Nine out of 10 victims were targeted because of their race, with 37 per cent of incidents taking place in public areas, the organization said. Verbal harassment and shunning occurred in over 90 per cent of the cases. Victims were physically assaulted, or coughed or spat on, in some 15 per cent of cases.
Some of the harassment has taken place inside of stores, Jeung said, adding that Stop AAPI Hate is working with retailers to figure out how to ensure safe access for customers.
The New York City Commission on Human Rights this week launched a multilingual campaign to combat COVID- 19-related discrimination after it received over 350 such complaints from Feb. 1 to May 15. Of these, 133, or 37 per cent, targeted Asians. That compared with just 11 complaints of discrimination targeted at Asians during the same period in 2019.
The FBI has warned of a rise in hate crimes against Asian- Americans since the coronavirus pandemic began, according to media reports citing internal documents.
SOLIDARITY ON STREETS In some Chinatowns, volunteer patrols are forming to protect residents and confront harassers. The Guardian Angels, with patrols in over 130 cities worldwide, are recruiting in U.S. Asian communities for the first time in 41 years. Members include seniors and women, who are often targets of abuse.
""It's boring at home. I might as well do something,"" said laid-off dental assistant Sara Chin. The 46-year-old also patrols with New York's Chinatown Block Watch.
""Our mission is to observe, record and report,"" said Leanna Louie, a San Francisco businesswoman who started patrol group United Peace Corp. In eight weeks, it has filed 24 reports, including medical response incidents, auto burglaries, theft and shoplifting, leading to three arrests, she noted.
""We can break the old habits, old patterns and outdated stereotypes,"" Louie said. ""We have assisted in aiding the community to step out of the shadows and feel more empowered."" The San Francisco Police Department has expanded its presence on foot and in cars around the city to act as a deterrent against such crimes, it said in a statement.
In New York, flyers and posters emblazoned with the words 'Don't be cruel' were created by Shirley Ng and her friends for display on Chinatown storefronts, with pointers on how to report a crime.
""I don't have to wait for support. It's my community,"" said Ng, an events assistant at the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund.",3449
"Commentary: Washington's political virus ""Makes America Hate Again""",None,Others,2020-05-27,"BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- On the night of June 19, 1982, 27-year-old Chinese American Vincent Chin was beaten to death by two white auto workers in the U.S. city of Detroit at a time when local politicians, union leaders and auto executives blamed Japan for the decline of the U.S. auto industry, and Chin was mistaken as a Japanese.
Chin's tragedy, along with many other similar bloody incidents in the United States, has highlighted a dangerous bond between racist rhetoric and hate-crime violence. Sadly, some Washington politicians have failed to learn a lesson from them and have in fact been feeding racism by spreading political viruses in the ferocious coronavirus pandemic.
In the face of a deadly virus, saving lives and containing the outbreak ought to be the top priorities. Yet the decision-makers in the White House have squandered their executive time on smearing China and fueling anti-Chinese sentiments with a carefully crafted political narrative.
Those Washington China-hardliners, most notably U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, have raced to use every possible chance to link the disease and the dire situation in the United States with China. In a recent ABC TV show, Navarro peddled his new conspiracy theory that China used air travels to ""seed"" the virus around the world.
Other senior U.S. politicians like U.S. Senator for Texas John Cornyn have also joined the China-bashing binge, seeking to pin the blame of the outbreak on what they claimed ""a culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that"" in China.
As a result of their racist propaganda, they have successfully ""made America hate again,"" and the hate-crime violence against Chinese and other Asian Americans has spiked across the United States. In California, a 16-year-old boy was beaten up in a high school and sent to the emergency room of a nearby hospital. In New York, a 39-year-old woman had acid thrown in her face outside her home. In Texas, a family of three, including children aged 2 and 6, were stabbed at a local Sam's Club.
An Ipsos poll in April finds that over 30 percent of Americans have witnessed COVID-19 bias against Asians. The STOP AAPI HATE reporting center, tasked to track coronavirus discrimination-related cases, has received 1,710 incident reports from Asian Americans across the country since mid-March.
As of now, the coronavirus has infected more than 1.6 million and killed nearly 100,000 in the United States. At a time when solidarity should be valued more than ever to bear down the pandemic, Washington's disinformation campaign can only foment animosity, tear up social fabric, and further worsen the racial divide in the country.
In fact, such racist talk has already made America's own pandemic fight more arduous. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Asian Americans represent 6 percent of the U.S. population, but 18 percent of the country's physicians and 10 percent of its nurse practitioners. Rampant racism has put these life savers in harm's way as some are shunned by patients, while others are facing increasing verbal harassment or even physical assaults at work.
Because of rising racist sentiments, economic reopening in the United States has also become tougher. As Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in late January, Asian American-owned businesses have been playing a key role in the U.S. economy, employing 3.6 million Americans and contributing over 700 billion U.S. dollars annually to America's gross domestic product. However, discrimination and hate have now started to lead people away from these businesses. That will give a body blow to the U.S. economy.
""We must act now to strengthen the immunity of our societies against the virus of hate,"" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said, calling on political leaders ""to show solidarity with all members of their societies and build and reinforce social cohesion.""
Those Washington politicians should heed this call, stay away from racism in the fight against humanity's common enemy, and avoid creating more hate-crime victims like Vincent Chin. Making America hate will only make America suffer.",4203
Chinese man killed in Mexico,"Borunda, Daniel",Others,2020-05-01,"
Mexican law enforcement investigating the killing of a Chinese immigrant in Chihuahua state are discarding the fatal shooting was a case of racial discrimination linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Chihuahua attorney general's office has not released the man's identity but reported he had resided in Mexico for five years.
The immigrant died from a gunshot wound to the head in the Chihuahua City area last week, the attorney general's office said. There have been no arrests.
Chihuahua state has widespread drug-related violence and homicides often go unsolved. Chihuahua City has been ranked among the world's most dangerous cities.
Chinese migration to the state of Chihuahua dates back to at least the 1870s with the growth of the railroad.
A news article on the Debate news website identified the man as Wujie Liang and had claimed that he was found beaten to death.
The Chihuahua attorney general's office issued a brief statement on April 22 saying it was conducting ""a serious and professional"" investigation and that it had ""discarded"" the theory that the homicide was motivated by discrimination or possible COVID-19 infection fears.
In the U.S., Asian Americans have become targets of harassment, bigotry and attacks as the pandemic that began in China has spread, USA TODAY reported.
On March 14, three members of an Asian American family, including 2-year-old and a 6-year-old, were stabbed in a Sam's Club store in Midland, Texas, in what the FBI listed as a a hate crime. The victims survived.
""The suspect indicated that he stabbed the family because he thought the family was Chinese, and infecting people with the coronavirus,"" stated an FBI analysis quoted by ABC News.
Jose L. Gomez III, 19, was arrested on three counts of attempted capital murder in connection with the stabbing, the Midland Reporter-Telegram reported.

Police in San Leandro, a suburb of 89,000 just south of Oakland, said officers were called to the Heron Bay neighborhood Friday evening after receiving reports of notes containing ""insensitive messages towards minorities"" taped to five homes.
""If you are a woman or man and was born in other country, return, go back to your land immediately, fast, with urgency,"" the note said. It ended with ""One American, white, brave, that serves the Nation or USA is going to live here.""

One resident gave the officers images captured on his doorbell security camera of a woman taping the note, and the officers soon found her in the area, police said in a statement.
Nancy Arechiga, 52, was carrying a backpack containing copies of the same notes, the statement said. She was arrested ""for these inappropriate messages that instilled fear and intimidation upon those residents.""
""We welcome people's rights to express themselves, but not in a manner that infringes upon a community's sense of security and well-being,"" Lt. Isaac Benabou said.
Arechiga was taken to Alameda County jail and booked for investigation of committing a hate crime. She was issued a citation and released from custody, another police official, Lt. Ted Henderson, said.
California has set bail at $0 for low-level crimes and misdemeanors in an effort to keep jails empty during the covid-19 pandemic.
Arechiga was told to appear in court, though the date hasn't been set because of the holiday weekend, he said.
It wasn't known whether she has retained a lawyer. A phone number listed for Arechiga has been disconnected.
Police were also investigating whether Arechiga was responsible for a similar note found Thursday on a local trail. The note partially read, ""no Asians allowed, leave immediately.""

PBS' 'Asian Americans' explores prejudice and perseverance,None,Others,2020-05-08,"
A century of racist attacks detailed in the new PBS documentary series “Asian Americans” might have felt like ancient history just a few months ago.
But through the lens of the coronavirus pandemic that originated in China and is now hitting the U.S., being painted as a foreign enemy has become all too familiar. Hundreds of Asian Americans have reported verbal and physical assaults since the nation's first infections surfaced in January. Even in cities with large Asian communities, people have hurled century-old slurs like “Chinaman.""
Daniel Dae Kim, a Korean American actor known for TV's “Lost"" and “Hawaii Five-0,"" faced racist trolling when he shared his COVID-19 diagnosis on Instagram in March. Kim, who narrates the documentary with actress Tamlyn Tomita, has recovered and feels ""back to 100%.”
“It’s been very eye-opening to see how much prejudice still exists in America and how deep seated it seems to be. But it’s part of the price one pays for speaking out, even against something as seemingly universal as injustice,” Kim said in an email to The Associated Press.
The five-episode series airing between Monday and Tuesday is a sweeping look at Asian Americans' impact on society, politics and pop culture from the mid-19th century through 9/11. Produced by Asian American filmmakers, the show features reflections from U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, “Fresh Off the Boat” star Randall Park and a host of people from other industries. There are also interviews with descendants whose family stories are heavily featured.
May is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, when Asians' contributions to the American landscape are often highlighted.
The virus-related attacks, however, have been a stark reminder of how quickly Asian Americans can go from neighbor to scapegoat. In a Los Angeles Times editorial last month, Korean American actor John Cho wrote how “belonging is conditional. One moment we are Americans, the next we are all foreigners, who ‘brought’ the virus here.”
That anti-Asian sentiment is all the more reason the documentary needs to be seen now, Kim said.
“Those who forget history are condemned to repeat it,” Kim said. “Asian Americans have a unique history in America. It’s one that should be celebrated as an indispensable part of our nation’s history.”
Renee Tajima-Peña, a series producer and professor of Asian American studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, had the monumental task of deciding how to fit decades of history into just five hours. She began with the arrival of Chinese railroad workers in the 1800s.
“We start at a time where we can still find people, if they’re descendants, with pictures and photographs,” Tajima-Peña said. “On the one hand, there was choosing which stories we felt were most important to tell. On the other hand, it’s TV. We have to make sure it’s something that’s watchable and the audience can engage with.”
The series covers well-known events like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the World War II internment of Japanese Americans and the 1982 beating death of Vincent Chin in Detroit.
But it also delves into lesser-known moments, like a 1965 labor strike organized by Filipino farmworkers in California, and spotlights people you may not recognize, like Patsy Mink, a Japanese American who in 1964 was the first woman of color elected to Congress.
There's also an interview with Tereza Lee, who inspired the now-stalled DREAM Act that would have given a path to citizenship for young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children.
Comedian Hari Kondabolu, known for his documentary “The Problem With Apu,” speaks in the series about post-9/11 treatment of Muslim Americans and Southeast Asian Americans. The coronavirus-related racism has drawn comparison to that time.
Like Kondabolu did in 2001, many young Asian Americans are now facing outright hate for the first time.
“I had never been targeted the way I had been in 9/11. That shaped how I viewed this country,” he said at a virtual town hall last week. ""The generation after 9/11 ... they’re gonna have to question where we are now. It’s going to inform how they will see the world.”
He's glad that the challenges and prejudices Asian Americans have faced for more than a century are enshrined in a documentary.
“Once it’s on PBS, it feels like an official document,"" Kondabalu said in an earlier interview. “This marks our place in the history of this country. It wasn’t there before.”
Tajima-Peña wouldn’t alter the episodes to address the pandemic if she could, saying viewers will inevitably connect it to present-day xenophobia. It's a “new story that really is an old story.""
“The whole COVID crisis, it’s really just amplified all the fault lines in the United States of race and class, poverty, health care. In terms of Asian Americans, of course, it’s this idea we’re so-called foreigners,” she said.
One of her hopes is the series will inspire younger Asian Americans to think beyond social media rants to activism.
“Our backs are against the walls. How do we move forward together? That’s what you see in the series,"" Tajima-Peña said. ""Asian Americans had to come together to defend our own rights.”",5170
"CHINESE, COVID-19 POSITIVE PEOPLE FEEL STIGMA","Fuoco, Michael A",Others,2020-05-10,"Ignorance may be bliss in some situations, but a lack of knowledge during a pandemic can lead to social stigma from those ascribing blame or risk of infection, say Asian Americans and people who have tested positive for COVID-19.
Stigma may take the form of social avoidance or rejection, gossip, physical violence or denial of service for health care, education, housing and employment. When the new coronavirus reached the United States, there were reports of Asian Americans being targeted nationwide in verbal and physical attacks linked to fears of COVID-19.
Marian Lien, president of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Organization of Chinese Americans, said that the incidence of local stigma has ""very much increased"" since early March, when local Asian American-owned restaurants and other establishments reported their business was down as much as 40%.
""There has been verbal harassment, which ranges from expletives to emphasizing 'Asians don't belong here,'"" she said. ""Whereas these kinds of bigoted comments were common enough, now there is an added layer of threat - a raised fist, a threatening look, spitting - all reinforcing the conditional way Asian Americans have been accepted in this country.""
Anyone of East Asian descent could become a scapegoat, Ms. Lien said.
""I think the fear, anxiety and increasing anger at stay-at-home orders and the experience of more and more job loss and financial insecurity is landing as a gut punch to the community easiest to scapegoat for these frustrations.""
People who have contracted COVID-19 are also at risk. Kristen Linfante, of Mt. Lebanon, said she was talking to her mail carrier on April 30. She was wearing a face mask and mentioned that she'd had the virus in March and had recovered. The next day, she said, someone from the Castle Shannon-Mt. Lebanon post office called to say she would no longer be getting her mail delivered. She called the office and talked to a supervisor, who told her that she would have to send someone to pick up her mail at the post office from now on because of the virus, she said.
""I offered to show them my test results. He was having none of that.""
She made numerous calls to try to resolve the situation, including to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. On May 1, she said, the supervisor called her back and said her mail would be delivered. He did not provide an explanation for the change.
Because it is relatively early in the outbreak, data has yet to be collected by social scientists to determine how widespread COVID-19-related stigma is, but the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Pennsylvania Health Department are so concerned that all have issued guidance on how to address and prevent it.
""We are certainly concerned about the potential for social stigma from COVID-19,"" said Nate Wardle, state Health Department press secretary. ""From the first cases in the United States, we were worried about potential stigmatization of people of Asian descent. But as we have seen [COVID-19] cases here in Pennsylvania, those concerns have increased to include anyone who tests positive, but also those in areas particularly affected, such as minority groups who work in life-sustaining jobs.
""The Wolf administration is working to ensure that communities do not feel threatened or at-risk because of COVID-19. This is already a difficult time for so many people, and we need all Pennsylvanians to be understanding of another. There are many people who are struggling with their health, struggling mentally, struggling financially, and we must be aware of that.""
In early April, Pennsylvania state police sent a letter to local, state and federal authorities reaffirming its commitment to enforce the state's laws regarding crimes of hate and bias. There have been no reported arrests connected to COVID-19 stigma thus far.
""The Asian American community and other minority groups should know that the state police take every allegation of hate/bias crime seriously, and each complaint receives a full investigation,"" said Col. Robert Evanchick, state police commissioner."" We will not tolerate hate or bias of any kind in Pennsylvania.""
As recently as March, President Donald Trump and conservative politicians and media were referring to COVID-19 as the ""Chinese coronavirus"" or ""Wuhan virus."" Mr. Trump later switched to calling it COVID-19, the term that the WHO coined in February so as not to refer to the origin of the outbreak.
In 2015, the World Health Organization established a new set of best practices for naming a disease, abandoning the former practice of naming it for its place of origin such as MERS for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, a viral respiratory illness that was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
While the coronavirus may be novel, tagging a region in naming an infectious disease dates back to the 19th century, when cholera that originated in the Ganges Delta and spread worldwide was named ""Asiatic cholera,"" Mari Webel, a history professor at the University of Pittsburgh, observed in an online article in The Conversation.
""It's going to take a lot more work to undo that kind of rhetoric in the long term, that this is this group's fault,"" said Ms. Webel, who holds a doctorate and whose research focus is on the relationship between infectious diseases and political and social change in Africa in the 20th century.
""We know how not to stigmatize people. We know how not to discriminate against people,"" she said. ""We need to be really deliberate in how we talk about the problem and to correct misinformation when we hear it, which is awkward but really important.
""The last thing we want right now is to have people suffering at home from this disease because they're afraid of what a positive test would mean."" Staff writer Torsten Ove contributed. Michael A. Fuoco: mfuoco@post-gazette.com.

OUR UGLIER SIDE CAN FLOURISH IN ISOLATION,None,Others,2020-05-23,"Sometimes it takes an outsider to hold a mirror up and shed light on the problems we gloss over. And racism, unfortunately, is one of those problems OUR greatest blessing is our greatest curse.
Living on this beautiful island continent means our borders have protected us from the worst of COVID-19, and yet this isolated lifestyle has infected us with a singularly insular attitude.
And unfortunately, we can’t blame the pandemic for this behaviour. When I arrived on the Gold Coast in 1991 at the age of 15, I was shocked by the racism on display. And that’s quite a statement from someone who grew up in Texas.
While the US has always had a race problem, perhaps it simply hides it better. Certainly that was my experience in 1980s Dallas when it came to Asian-American classmates ... their culture was not an issue. And actually, their culture was primarily American.
Then I moved here and heard phrases and slurs that I never even knew existed. These racial smears were uttered not only by adults who should know better, but by my own teenage “friends’’ who would shout such things at total strangers in Pacific Fair.
I was certainly not in Texas any more.
In the ensuing decades, I honestly do believe Australians have bettered their behaviour.
Pauline Hanson’s warnings of an “Asian invasion’’ notwithstanding, Aussies have mostly welcomed our Asian neighbours.
But this virus has seen a relapse in racial ignorance.
Last week a friend was finally able to visit her favourite nail salon and asked her technician, a woman originally from South Korea now raising her family here on the Coast, how her world had changed since her business was forced to close in March.
The woman broke down, saying she was heartbroken and wanted to return to her parents. She said since the outbreak of coronavirus she had been verbally abused, beeped at on the road, and denigrated by her fellow city residents. And all this while in the company of her own children.
Gold Coast, we are much better than this. And yet her experience is not isolated.
Just last month, police issued a stern warning to Queenslanders following a massive spike in the number of racially motivated attacks against the Chinese community during the coronavirus pandemic.
Queensland Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll and Police Minister Mark Ryan said the abuse that Chinese Australians were experiencing during the crisis was “abhorrent’’.
We don’t need to agree with China’s Government, we don’t even need to like China’s Government, I know I certainly don’t. But that has nothing to do with Chinese people who live here, let alone anyone of Asian descent in our city.
And so I choose to believe that this behaviour stems from a very vocal but very small minority of imbeciles. And so I choose to believe that my own children’s friends would never repeat the slurs of my 1990s classmates.
Certainly, I know with all my heart that my children themselves never would. The ironic thing is that I was absolutely incensed this week to read reports of British actor Miriam Margolyes’s own sledges against Australians in general, and the Gold Coast in particular.
The 78-year-old, who played Professor Sprout in the Harry Potter films, recently filmed ABC documentary series Almost Australian and said the process left her feeling slightly disenchanted with the country.
In particular, she said she found Surfers Paradise confronting. “There is a brutality there and a greed in Australia which I don’t like ... people should be ashamed of living in Surfers Paradise, it’s disgusting. I think that actually shocked me because I don’t go there. It’s not my world and I don’t want to go there.
“I hope people will not be too annoyed about the things I have to say, but in the end, to be honest, f**k ’em if they are.
After almost 30 years living in this city, and a lifetime as an Australian citizen, I don’t like anyone badmouthing my home town.
But I can also acknowledge that sometimes we need the opinions of outsiders to make us see the full picture. To make us take a good hard look in the mirror and accept that, in certain angles, our ugly side has been on display.
Because while I firmly believe Margolyes is in the wrong, I also believe that we need so-called outsiders, the almost Australians, to make our city richer – socially, culturally and economically. That is a true blessing",4350
'You belong exactly where you are': CBC star's message for fellow Asian Canadians takes aim at xenophobia,None,Others,2020-05-04,"Chinese Canadian actor Simu Liu is deeply proud of his heritage and likes to champion it whenever he can.
But the discrimination, racism and xenophobia that's been aimed at the Asian community during the COVID-19 crisis has put a damper on such spirits.
The star of CBC's ""Kim's Convenience"" and Marvel's upcoming film ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" says he's heard from countless people who have experienced such discrimination and he's faced it himself during the pandemic.
He's hoping to shift the narrative by celebrating Asian and South Asian Heritage Month this month - and spotlighting the works of notable Asian Canadians - on social media as a new ambassador for Made / Nous, a movement recognizing creative Canadian talent.
Also taking part in the campaign is Tamil-Canadian actress Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, star of Mindy Kaling's new Netflix series ""Never Have I Ever.""
""I think it is especially important now in this day and age, at this time where anti-Asian sentiment and xenophobia is higher than it's ever been in a very long time - and I don't think you can argue that,"" Liu said in a recent phone interview from Sydney, where he was filming ""Shang-Chi"" until the pandemic halted production. His role as the kung-fu master makes him Marvel's first big-screen Asian American superhero.
""Every day, I see more instances of hate crimes and discrimination, not only in Canada but the U.S. and Australia, where I'm at. There have been a lot of cases of people getting spat on in the street, verbally abused, physically abused. It's really easy to be weighed down by all of this hate that's brewing in the world.""
Liu, who immigrated to Canada from northern China at age five, and grew up in Etobicoke and Mississauga, said he felt such discrimination first-hand when he was recently walking out of a restaurant in Sydney before the pandemic lockdown came into full force.
""I had a piece of food in my throat and I was trying to get it out, and was coughing and hacking a little bit,"" he said. ""And this white guy comes out of a restaurant with a woman and looks over at me and, without even thinking about it, he just says ""Coronavirus"" and chuckles to himself and keeps walking.
""I was honestly so shocked in that moment that I didn't even know how to react. And I did just kind of brush it off ... But it's just a taste of what is going on in the world right now and what collectively people are thinking.""
Liu added: ""I feel like if you're an Asian person in the world in 2020, you're fighting a virus on two fronts. We are, like every single other person in this world, at the mercy of this COVID thing. And then we're also at the same time fighting this virus of hate that has apparently spread and infected just as many people, if not more.""
The 31-year-old graduate of the Ivey School of Business at Western University said he stayed in Sydney once production on ""Shang-Chi"" was halted partly because ""Australia is in very good shape compared to a lot of other countries in the world"" when it comes to COVID-19. And there was a risk of contracting the disease through travel.
He celebrated his birthday last month by asking his social media followers to donate to either the Trillium Health Partners hospital system in Mississauga or a health network of their choice.
The initiative raised more than $10,000, Liu said, noting he matched that figure himself in a donation spread among different hospitals and non-profits.
His advice for those facing racism at this time is ""not to buy into this 'go-back-to-where-you-came-from, you-don't-belong-here' kind of mentality and rhetoric that is being propagated by some top politicians.""
""You belong exactly where you are, and you deserve to stand on your own two feet and hold your head high no matter what,"" he said.
""Call it out when you see it and then reach out if you ever feel like you need somebody to talk to, because I think the aim with a lot of these angry people is to make us feel alone and isolated.""
Liu said he's happy to hear from those who want to reach out to him on social media. And he noted that hate crimes can also be reported to authorities.
""We're all in this together,"" he said. ""We're going through it and we're fighting for each other's causes. And together we're going to get through it, as long as we keep being active in holding these individuals accountable for their actions and their words.
""A big part of why this has gotten so much media coverage is because Asian people who have been attacked are refusing to let it go and they're filming their perpetrators. ""And we're making an effort to call out these attacks and not brush them off, and to take it seriously.""",4676
"Asian-American students in New York respond to racist abuse with help of mentors and advice from non-profit: With help of mentors and a non-profit group, Asian-American students in New York are learning how to respond to a surge in racist abuse brought on by the coronavirus crisis","Chan, Bernice",Others,2020-05-08,"Earlier this year, Jason Chen Weiping was left speechless when an older student at school in New York taunted him with a video of a Chinese woman eating bat soup.
""He said that Asians were freaks, that they caused the coronavirus. I didn't know how to respond. I felt he was justified for what he was saying because he had the video,"" recalls the 16-year-old, who was born in Taishan, Guangdong province, and emigrated to the US with his mother when he was a baby.
Jason has since discovered that the video was filmed three years ago in Palau, Micronesia - not in China.
Cases of harassment and bullying of Asian-Americans have surged in the United States since the coronavirus began spreading there, months after the first cluster of Covid-19 cases was reported in Wuhan in late December. This new wave of racism has inspired non-profit organisation Apex for Youth to take a stand.
The group organises workshops and mentoring for school-age Asian-Americans from disadvantaged backgrounds in New York.
Even before the pandemic broke out, more than half of Asian-American students in the US said they had been bullied at school - which is more than any other ethnic group, says Jiyoon Mary Chung, interim executive director of Apex.
Apex recently surveyed 100 students on the social effects of the pandemic. Half the respondents expressed concern or anxiety about anti-Asian discrimination, and 15 per cent said they had directly experienced racism. Also, 40 per cent of respondents reported that their families had been affected financially by the virus outbreak.
""They hear things like, Chinese people are dirty or disgusting, or their own president calling the virus a 'Chinese virus',"" Chung says. ""When this happens, what do you say back? Or is the person worth your time? We encourage the students to stay connected with their mentors to talk about their feelings and get practical suggestions on what to do.""
If bullying is conducted online, for example, Apex suggests young people should unfollow and report the bully or speak out. If someone is being taunted in person, a bystander could stand beside them for moral support or help the victim leave the scene. If they feel comfortable, they could speak out - but focus on the idea or behaviour, not the instigator of the attack.
Apex also encourages young people to point out that the coronavirus pandemic has nothing to do with ethnicity, or, if they know the person, engage in a conversation, Chung says. They are also encouraged to take care of themselves by exercising regularly, meditating, or finding a creative outlet through which to channel their emotions.
Apex has worked with thousands of students of Chinese, Korean, Japanese and South Asian descent since it was founded in New York in 1992 by dentist Alex Tsui and four of his Asian-American friends. Their aim was to help families from similar ethnic and cultural backgrounds to theirs.
Apex mentors are carefully chosen in a rigorous process that includes several interviews; Jason's mentor, 28-year-old Elvin Yuen, says it took at least six months for him to be accepted. All mentors are trained and then matched with young people with similar backgrounds, interests and goals.
Yuen, a banker who was born in Hong Kong and grew up in Manhattan, says Jason was upset by the bat soup video incident, which happened before the city was locked down. ""He fell silent because he didn't know what to say about the woman eating bat soup,"" Yuen says. ""These things are happening, but we have to stay educated and try to defuse the situation.""
Jason, who says he has experienced racism from an early age, later suggested that Apex run workshops to specifically address bullying fuelled by the pandemic.
""I grew up in Spanish Harlem, where there are different minorities. People would make slitty eyes or say 'Ching Chong' at me,"" Jason recalls. ""When I went into kindergarten, I only knew like three words in English, and so when I said something in Chinese everyone looked at me weird.""
By the time he was 10, Jason's reaction to xenophobic taunts got him into fights. Two years later, he learned about Apex from his mother's social worker. He initially thought it was a place where studious Asians did their homework after school, but quickly discovered it was more about being able to talk to an adult who could relate to him, attend workshops on issues such as Asian identity and bullying, and go on trips.
Jason plans to become a paediatrician ""because the salary is more appealing than being a teacher"". Yuen says the teenager is becoming more studious, and is practising for the SAT exams to get into university and then medical school.
The mentoring experience has been ""very rewarding"", Yuen says. ""Jason is focused on his schoolwork and his goals of where he wants to end up. I gave him a heads-up about working with kids and suggested he apply to be a summer camp counsellor.""
Asked if he feels more Chinese or American, Jason thinks for a minute and replies in Cantonese, jook sing, or ""overseas Chinese"". ""I feel Chinese, but when I'm in China my Chinese is so bad,"" he says. ""But I like being Chinese.""
Preeti Sriratana, 43, chairman of the Apex board, was also troubled as a child. He was born in Chicago and raised by Thai immigrant parents in Normal, Illinois, where he was bullied and struggled at school. Encouraged by his grandmother and teachers, Sriratana pursued his studies and graduated with a master's degree in architecture from Columbia University. He is now a partner and managing director of a New York-based architectural firm.
""The mentoring gives children an opportunity to ask questions they can't ask their parents, or if their parents don't know the system. This relationship is so important,"" he says.
In 2001, he mentored a 12-year-old boy who grew up in New York's Chinatown and had never been to Central Park. Another boy he mentored almost dropped out of school, but eventually became an architect like him. The boy's best friend - also helped by Apex - has become a nurse and is now working on the Covid-19 front line.
""We don't push them to be doctors and lawyers. We want to instil in them the three Cs: Confidence, College-ready and Come back and give to the community,"" Sriratana says. ""It's not just about schooling, but being well-rounded. We want to see more Asian-Americans in leadership positions across different sectors.""
Andrew Yang, a contender for the US Democratic Party presidential nomination until he bowed out in favour of Joe Biden, is a long-time Apex supporter. Like actress Gemma Chan, Carol Lim and Humberto Leon of fashion label Opening Ceremony, and singer-songwriter Jhené Aiko, he has been honoured with an award from the organisation.
Apex's annual fundraising gala has been postponed to September, when the it plans to honour actress Lana Condor, who starred in To All the Boys I've Loved Before on Netflix, and Amanda Nguyen, founder and CEO of Rise, a non-profit organisation that fights for the civil rights of victims of sexual violence.
Jason was one of the speakers at last year's gala, and Chung says the teenager spent a long time working on his speech. He talked about the racism he faced growing up, and recalled an incident at a railway station when a stranger shouted a racist slur at him and his mother.
""I asked my mum why she didn't say anything,"" Jason recalls. ""Our generation should speak up. Our parents came here to provide a better opportunity for us, so they never think to speak up. But we should defend ourselves.""
Jason's mother was in the audience, and at the end of the speech he thanked her for the sacrifices she made to bring him to the US. Tears streamed down her cheeks.",7688
Asian Americans medics battling racism amid pandemic,None,Others,2020-05-21,"Washington D.C. [USA], May 21 (ANI): Asian American health-care workers in the United States have reported a rise in bigoted incidents in recent weeks that has left the entire community, who represent 6 per cent of the total population, in a painful position on the front lines of the response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Due to the racial hostility, some covid-19 patients refuse to be treated by the doctors and nurses from the Asian American community, who represent 18 per cent of the country's physicians and 10 per cent of its nurse practitioners, The Washington Post reported.
And when doctors and nurses leave the hospital, they face increasing harassment in their daily lives, too, including racist verbal abuse and physical attacks. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has also warned of a potential surge in hate crimes against Asians as the coronavirus death toll mounts and stay-at-home orders are lifted.
Three Asian-American medical providers on the front lines of the pandemic spoke with the Post about the racial discrimination they faced as the virus spread on.
A man followed Lucy Li, a Chinese American doctor from the Boston hospital, spewing a profanity-laced racist tirade as she makes the rounds in the covid-19 intensive care unit. ""Why are you Chinese people killing everyone?"" Li recalled the man shouting. ""What is wrong with you? Why the f--- are you killing us?""
Stunned at first, then relieved she was not physically attacked, Li, 28, is now saddened and angered by the irony that she spends her days and nights helping save lives. Her work inserting tubes in patients' airways has grown riskier since the coronavirus emerged -- each procedure releasing droplets and secretions that could carry viral particles.
""I'm risking my own personal health, and then to be vilified just because of what I look like,"" Li was quoted as saying.
""I try not to think about that possibility when I'm at work taking care of patients. But it's always there, at the very back of my mind,"" he added.
Some academic experts on race say President Trump's rhetoric around the virus and China has contributed to the rise in racial harassment. For weeks, Trump deliberately referred to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" despite guidance from public health officials to avoid attaching locations or ethnicity to a disease. He has since tweeted that Asian Americans are not to be blamed for the virus's spread.
""People are worried about transmission of a disease that they associate with foreignness and Asian faces,"" said Grace Kao, a Yale University sociologist, told the Post. ""Nothing erases what we look like,"" Kao added.
An analysis of self-reported incidents by Russell Jeung, chairman of the Asian American studies department at San Francisco State University, shows a steady rise in reports of harassment and assault against Asians since mid-March, with twice as many women than men saying they have been mistreated.
Jeung said he expects harassment and violence against Asian Americans to grow in coming months as states reopen their economies and people return to work, school and public life.
""People make automatic assumptions, especially in times of threats, and go into fight-or-flight mode. The fight mode is attacking or harassing Asians, and the flight mode is shunning Asians,"" he stated further.
Gem Manalo, a Mass General anesthesiology resident who is of Chinese and Filipino descent, was riding the ""T,"" as the subway is called in Boston, across the river to Cambridge for a yoga class in early March when she said a man starting yelling: ""F--- China! F--- the Chinese!""
Audrey Li, an internal-medicine resident at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and born to Chinese immigrant parents in New Jersey, who plans to specialize in infectious diseases, said she was repeatedly told by a frustrated patient at another hospital to ""go back to your country.""
But many Asian Americans felt offended by seemingly having to justify their existence. ""You people eat bats! It shouldn't matter if you're a front-line worker,"" said Esther Choo, an emergency-room physician in Portland, Ore., who hosts a podcast on the coronavirus pandemic.
""Every time something like this happens, there's this wave of, 'But we're so good, and we don't deserve this.' No, you don't deserve this because you're human."" ",4341
COVID-19 and the racism factor,None,Others,2020-05-26,"Sri Lanka, May 26 -- Australia is entering what observers here say could be a deep recession, the first in almost 30 years. It was the rise of China that helped this sparsely populated vast continent to avoid a recession for the past three decades, the most extended period of economic growth in Australian history.
Rather than being thankful to China, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne in a local TV interview on April 19 called for an ""independent"" inquiry into the origins of COVID-19 in Wuhan expressing concerns about transparency from China on the issue.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison emphasised that in subsequent media briefings and he led a campaign with the support of the European Union (EU) to press the World Health Assembly (WHA) to trigger an independent probe.
Though the WHA passed the resolution on May 15 with China co-sponsoring it, the outcome was far from what Australia (and the U.S.) wanted. It even led to a spat with the Chinese Embassy in Canberra that issued a statement saying that it is ""a joke"" to claim that the WHO adopted the Australian initiative.
""Australia and the United States have been particularly close since the Second World War. When we were at risk of invasion they became our Allies and remained so,"" former Immigration Minister Phillip Ruddock told IDN in an interview.
When asked how the Government of John Howard - who publicly said that Australia could be the U.S.'s deputy Sheriff in Asia - handled the relationship with China, he said. ""(We were) able to manage some difficult issues with China through regular Human Rights dialogues."" Ruddock was part of the Howard Cabinet.
  ""independent"" investigation
Morrison started the campaign for a so-called ""independent"" investigation, at a time when the media coverage here on the COVID-19 issue had invoked the ""yellow peril"" prejudices of the 19th century that fuelled the 'White Australia' policy. It was lifted only in the late 1970s when Asia was seen as a potential cash cow for Australia. It did, and until the advent of COVID-19, tourists and international students from China, and Chinese mineral and food imports were the major foreign currency earners for the country going into billions of dollars.
""We need to look at the risk factors of the pandemic and the cost and benefits. A blame game will not achieve a constructive and beneficial bilateral relationship between Australia and China,"" argues Tony Pang, past president of Chinese Australian Forum, pointing out that 90 per cent of Australian exports go to Asia with China taking 37.2 per cent of it. At the same time, the U.S. accounts for only 3.8 per cent according to 2019 data.
""I believe, to some extent, the current racism against Asians is a result of China's growth, influence and economic might and the adverse media coverage over the last few years, and especially after the arrival of Covid-19,"" he told IDN.
Andrew Jakubowicz, Emeritus Professor of Sociology from the University of Technology Sydney told IDN in an interview that ""the language used was either intentionally inflammatory or recklessly loose and undisciplined"".
He added: ""Even China recognises that an inquiry-based on the scientific method that rigorously interrogates the emergence of the virus and the more or less successful modes of address across the world, is an excellent idea. Though not one that seeks out evidence to convict China of some unnamed crime"".
In the past two weeks, China has shown in no uncertain terms, through media briefing from China's Ambassador Jingye Cheng in Canberra and Foreign Affairs spokesman Zhao Lijianin in Beijing that the Chinese Government is unhappy with the way Australia called for such an inquiry. They have already imposed economic sanctions against Australia dressed up as anti-dumping and hygienic measures.
On May 18, the Chinese Government announced it would press ahead with its threat to impose an 80 per cent tariff on Australian barley - effectively blocking Australian farmers from selling their crops to their most lucrative market. They claimed that the Australian Government was subsidising the farmers to ""dump"" barley on the Chinese market at below production costs.
On May 19, Beijing has slapped Australian beef exporters with sanctions for ""repeated violations of inspection and quarantine requirements"". Trade Minister Simon Birmingham was at pains not to paint it as economic retaliation from China, but ""isolated labelling error"" that will be corrected.
COVID-19 lockdowns
Sanctions could hit hard on an economy already facing a severe crisis from both the impact of bushfires in the summer and now COVID-19 lockdowns. This week Birmingham complained that his Chinese counterpart was refusing to take calls to discuss the issue. He has hinted that Australia may have to take the barley tariffs to the WTO disputes process.
The Chinese ambassador has also hinted at the Chinese consumers ""losing the taste"" for Australian wines. China is Australia's biggest wine market. Wine-maker Bill Widen told ABC TV that for three years they have been selling wines to China. Before the COVID-19 crisis, they have been sending every two months a container full of 18,000 bottles of wine to China. ""The most popular wine at the moment in China, by volume, is Australian wine, so Australian producers have made inroads into the China market,"" he said.
His wife Vicki visibly upset at the impact Australia's call for an inquiry may have on their business added: ""You spend many many years building a relationship with a country. And if you lose that relationship with China . it will be devastating, not only for us here.""
Australian commercial media, in particular, have been drumming up anti-China sentiments in the country by repeatedly claiming that China is using its economic muscle to bully Australia, after spreading the coronavirus
across the globe. They are also appealing to widespread resentments among Australians of Chinese purchases of large Australian assets as well as real estate in recent years.
""Australia has taken the view that the purchase of Australian assets by Chinese state corporations has strategic as well as economic parameters,"" argues Professor Jakubowicz. He commented on why there is no such resentment against widespread purchases of Australian assets by the British and American companies.
""My sense is (that) the perceived threat of Chinese imperial power from a one-party state bent on extending its empire, is more challenging in Australia than competing corporate interests from other former or existing empires.""
This resentment of Chinese economic power and the media's persistent attempts to project COVID-19 as a 'Chinese export' is reflected in a rise in racist attacks on Asian (Chinese)-Australians in recent months, where ordinary Australians have called them spreaders of coronavirus.
""I have been verbally racially abused several times since the arrival of COVID-19,"" says Pang. ""My wife, a third- generation Australian, was called 'coronavirus'. Her grandfather arrived in Australia from China in the late 1800s."" Her Chinese-Australian father had served with the Australian Armoured Division in World War II (1939-1945) and her uncle in Borneo as an Infantry.
""My friend's daughter was spitted on, and his shoulder elbowed another friend at a supermarket by a male,"" he adds.
[The Borneo campaign of 1945 was one of the most complex operations involving Australian land, air and sea forces in the war. It was also the last Australian campaign to be planned and undertaken. Borneo had been captured by the Japanese in early 1942.]
Trent Zimmerman, Member of Parliament for North Sydney - an electorate that includes over 20,000 Asian- Australians - raised the issue of such public attacks in parliament in Canberra on May 18.
""It does disappoint me enormously to have to rise in this chamber to raise and condemn the racism experienced by some in the Australian Chinese community during this pandemic,"" he told the parliament.
While admitting that most Australians would support the call for an independent international inquiry on the role of wet markets in the origins of the coronavirus, these attacks ""are not what this is about"", he noted.
With the Government taking a blame game strategy, there are concerns among liberal and academic circles that the community sentiments that led to the 'White Australia' policy may be re-emerging.
But, Ruddock argues that Australia's approach to foreign investments is not different from China's. ""All substantial proposals are reviewed through the Foreign Investment Review Board. This is not surprising. Even China takes a critical view of foreign investment in China,"" he says. He adds: ""Government policy is non-discriminatory based on race (but) restrictions on ownership by foreign nationals do exist.""
As for the 'White Australia' policy resurfacing, Ruddock says, ""(it) was abandoned some 50 years ago and there is no place in Australia for any discrimination based on race, country of origin, culture or religion"".
Professor Jakubowicz agrees that the abolition of the 'White Australia' policy ""has worked reasonably well"". However, he thinks that racialised thinking still sits strongly within the hierarchies of political parties, in the mass media, and the public sphere. ""COVID-19 period has permitted racists to target Chinese and other Asian Australians, but there has also been widespread civil society push back,"" he points out. But, Pang has reservations.
""Many of my Asian Australian friends are shocked at the sudden spate of racism arising from COVID-19, despite efforts from community organisations' initiative to call on media and politicians to curtail racism, the incidence of racism continues,"" he maintains.",9733
"Virus - best of times, worst of times","Ellsworth, Barry",Others,2020-05-21,"The coronavirus has fostered the best and the worst in Canadians.
The best are the nurses and doctors who have come out of retirement to help those already in the health-care trenches.
The best is all the retail sector workers who staff the grocery stores and pharmacies to keep the public fed and prescriptions filled. Add those working in nursing homes and others collecting garbage and recycling.
The worst is the attack on Asian Canadians, both verbal and physical.
A much larger white guy punches a small Asian in the face. Another yells at two Asian women aboard a Vancouver bus. ""Go back to your country; that's where it all started.""
And Canadian singer Bryan Adams goes into a Twitter rant condemning ""bat-eating, wet-market animal selling, virus-making greedy bastards"" who are responsible for turning the world on end by introducing the world to the pandemic.
Adams was accused of racism and apologized. I don't know why.
Many news agencies, including CBS, USA Today and closer to home, CTV News, posit the virus may have indeed been carried by a bat, spread to an intermediary animal that in turn was sold at an unsanitary so-called ""wet market"" in Hunan province in China. If you have looked up these markets online you can easily see the filthy conditions that could spawn this pandemic.
There is no chance the virus was created in a Chinese lab, say American, British and Australian researchers. Adams is quite likely speaking the truth and if you don't like it, too bad.
But abusive language and physical violence against Chinese Canadians - in some cases lumping all Asians together - is flat out wrong.
The overall Canadian favourability toward China has plummeted to 14 per cent, according to an Angus Reid Institute poll. And 85 per cent say the Chinese government has not been honest or transparent about the pandemic.
  In other words, it is not the Chinese, it is the Chinese government our anger should be directed toward.
The Chinese government also said the virus could not have come from a wet market because the government made wet markets illegal. Sure, more than one billion people and the communist government said it is so, then it must be so. It is the same tactic used by Trump - if you don't test for the coronavirus the number would be very few. ""It's common sense,"" says the nonsensical buffoon.
Damned fools. (Clarification: In a column last week headlined, 'Father, son playing catch expensive these days', the first subject tackled was the King Street, Trenton, reconstruction.
I was given erroneous information by someone who was not qualified to give me the goods on the revamping. Suffice it to say residents will have a spot for garbage and recycling and will not have to put said items on the bike lane.)",2749
"Now more than ever, we must call out racism: OPINION","Tanner, Adrienne",Others,2020-05-19,"Vancouver journalist who writes about civic affairs Among the innumerable sorrows the coronavirus pandemic has heaped upon us, the surge of racist attacks against people of Asian descent is one of the most despicable.
Canada, which fancies itself a country of people from diverse ethnicities who all get along, has not been immune.
When people are fearful - and who hasn't been lately - they seek to blame. Right now, the scapegoat is China, where COVID-19 first struck, and by extension anyone who looks Asian.
Take the recent attack by a white man on a Vancouver bus whose anger was fuelled by two Asian women wearing masks. Police say he yelled, ""Go back to your country. That's where it all started."" When another woman spoke out against the remarks, he kicked her and yanked her hair so hard a clump of it fell out.
In Toronto an Asian nurse, also wearing a mask, reported she was yelled at, spit on and smacked with an umbrella by a white woman who yelled at her to go back to where she came from.
The sentiment that China and its people are responsible for the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus is being perpetuated by people in the highest levels of government in the United States, including President Donald Trump himself.
The President's remarks are certainly egging on those looking to place blame. But to say Mr. Trump is responsible for racist displays here in Canada is to deny our own history.
Racism underpinned policies prohibiting Chinese labourers from bringing their families to Canada when they came to build the railways. It also drove the decision to intern Japanese Canadians during the Second World War. More recently, it led to nasty rhetoric against wealthy Chinese investors who were encouraged by developers and politicians to buy homes and businesses here and then blamed for the exponential rise in property values.
Scratch the surface, and it seems Canada's ""Yellow Peril"" ideologies are still very alive.
COVID-19's origin in China isn't in and of itself racist. And to keep the virus in check, scientists must determine its origin (likely bats) and learn how it jumped to some other animal that people touch or eat. If, as most scientists believe, the virus originated in a Wuhan market where many types of live animals were sold, there will need to be changes.
    The Chinese government has already made it illegal to sell or eat wild animals and further restrictions and hygiene improvements could be in order.
But while it is totally fair to scrutinize China's food chain in relation to health, blaming Chinese people for spreading a deadly virus is not. This week singer Bryan Adams, who is vegan, unleashed a profane Twitter rant against ""bat-eating, wet-marketanimal selling, virus-making greedy bastards."" After he was excoriated for what sounded to many like a racist diatribe, he issued a lame apology and claimed he was only taking a stand against animal cruelty.
Before anyone gets too highminded about Western food choices and animal husbandry, let's not forget what led to the outbreak of mad cow disease (Bovine spongiform encephalopathy), which infected British cows in the 1980s and 1990s. The root cause was the practice of feeding cattle a ""protein"" mixture made from other cattle who died from the disease and sheep infected with a related condition called scrapie. When the disease jumped to humans, it killed 177 people.
There was no racist backlash against the British, at least not that I recall. The outbreak was widely regarded as a misfortune.
After news broke about the latest racist attack aboard a Vancouver bus, North Vancouver MLA Bowinn Ma, whose parents immigrated to Canada from Taiwan, posted a heartfelt message on Twitter articulating her thoughts on anti-Asian racism, which she points out exists worldwide.
The problem with high-profile people such as Mr. Trump and Mr. Adams playing the blame game is it emboldens others to ""embrace their biases, their prejudices and ignorant ideas about other people as though they are righteous,"" Ms. Ma says. From there it's a short line to hate crimes.
We are a tolerant society, reluctant to fall into American style tribal politics. But, now more than ever, we all must call out racism where we see it because complacency allows it to grow.",4257
Attacking Asians won't kill the virus,"Lee, Kate E",Others,2020-05-01,"More than 650 racist incidents were reported to the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, a coalition of community-based groups in Los Angeles, in just one week in March. A man hit a Forest Hills dad in front of his son at a bus stop while yelling, ""You [expletive] Chinese!"" and another man stabbed an entire family at a Texas grocery store. In Midtown, a woman punched a 23-year-old Korean student, yelling, ""You've got coronavirus, you Asian [expletive]!"" and the student went to Bellevue Hospital for possible jaw dislocation. A friend in one of my classes was walking recently in Manhattan when some people yelled ""Yuck!"" and ""Get out of here!"" As a Korean-American medical student in Manhattan, that could have been me.
On Tuesday, Ipsos released a survey for the Center for Public Integrity with alarming findings: 30% of Americans say they have seen someone blame Asians for the COVIID-19 pandemic, and 60% of Asians, who made up 6% of respondents, say they have seen the same behavior.
That is so different from when I came to the United States at age 6. Then, I hardly ever encountered racism. Instead, my teachers, who happened to be white, were supportive and encouraging. My fifth-grade teacher in Baltimore even surprised me at graduation with a scholarship with some of her retirement funds, an act of kindness that moves me to this day, and makes me dream of giving back as she did. In fact, the desire to give back has fueled my studies to become a doctor. But as an Asian-American medical student watching COVID-19 unfold, I feel a sharp conflict in my identity because on one hand, Asian Americans are targeted, and on the other hand, medical professionals are regarded as modern-day heroes. I am confused and discouraged by the outbreaks of racism in a country that has shown me openness and acceptance.
In a disaster like this one, people want to assign blame. For some, finding someone to blame can help make sense of the situation. Blame can also be an emotional response to hold others responsible for our own resentment, indignation, or guilt. In the history of epidemics, this isn't the first time Asian Americans have faced hostility. During smallpox in 1876, a San Francisco health officer blamed ""unscrupulous, lying and treacherous Chinamen"" for their ""diabolical disregard of our sanitary laws,"" according to Nayan Shah, author of ""Contagious Divides."" When bubonic plague hit the area in 1900, local health authorities planned to inject Chinese and Japanese people with a highly toxic experimental vaccine. During SARS in 2003, people on the internet circulated emails warning to avoid Asian areas, causing New York City's Chinatown to experience dramatic drops in business. In other epidemics, other immigrants have been scapegoats: Irish immigrants for typhoid and West Africans for Ebola. In this crisis, President Donald Trump has repeatedly called COVID-19 ""Chinese virus"" as a way of blaming the disease on foreigners. This was even after the World Health Organization published best practices in 2015 stating ""disease names may NOT include"" geographic locations, learning from past unintended stigmatization.
Looking forward, my classmates and I are volunteering in a medical student task force assisting our front-line health care providers. Instead of directing attacks against our Asian neighbors, let's focus on coming together to beat the virus. Let's move forward, and stop looking backward to attribute blame.

World: Campaign aims to #WashTheHate of coronavirus racism,None,Others,2020-05-04,"The #WashTheHate campaign in the US calls for solidarity with Asian-Americans who have seen an increase of attacks since the outbreak of COVID-19. It makes clear that hate will get you sick, even if the virus doesn't.
Since growing up in New York City, Telly Wong has witnessed the September 11 terror attacks, Hurricane Sandy and now COVID-19 - and racism aimed at Asian-Americans that has accompanied the virus.
In addition to the growing number of news reports about Asian-Americans being attacked, one of Wong's friends told him that a stranger attacked her on the street while she had on a mask before many other people had started wearing them - she ended up with a broken hand.
Wong said the coronavirus attacks reminded him of another series of crimes committed against Asians in the United States.
""I remember being a kid in the 80s and 90s, there was a rush of assaults and robberies and even murders of Chinese delivery men"", he told DW. ""They were just reported as hit and runs. No one connected the dots.""
Now a senior vice president at a New York marketing and communication agency, Wong said he knew he could raise awareness of the issue and help people connect the dots this time
He and his colleagues launched the #WashTheHate campaign on March 18 to collect and publish stories and videos of incidents that would otherwise go unnoticed. The timing was right: A day before the planned launch, US President Donald Trump publicly called the coronavirus the ""Chinese virus.""
""Wash away the hate!""
Actor Tzi Ma is one of the campaign's supporters. He describes himself on Instagram bio as ""Hollywood's favorite Asian dad."" The Chinese-American star is known for his role in the ""Rush Hour"" film series and recently played another Asian dad in the drama ""The Farewell.""
Ma was one of the internet and entertainment celebrities who posted a video for #WashTheHate. In his video, the 57-year-old washes his hands while talking to the camera: ""We all know washing our hands can help us prevent the coronavirus affecting us physically. But what about what the virus can do to us emotionally? We are all scared. We act out of our fears by wearing masks, hoarding supplies and, sadly, some of us lash out at Asian-Americans as if Asian-Americans were responsible for this virus just for being of Asian descent. Stop it. Acts of violence against Asian-Americans will not stop the spread of this virus. The next time you wash your hands, wash out the hate you may have for your fellow Americans. Hate will get you sick, even if the virus doesn't.""
Verbal attacks, physical violence
Talking about the campaign, Ma told Variety magazine about how a driver of a car next to him at the supermarket yelled, ""You should be quarantined!"" before driving away. It was one of many incidents happening across the United States as the coronavirus spreads.
In Texas, a Burmese-American and his two children were attacked and injured by a man with a knife. The FBI said the 19-year-old suspect likely tried to kill the family because they looked Chinese and he believed they would spread the coronavirus.
In Brooklyn, a man yelled at a 26-year-old at a train station, telling her to, ""Go back to China! Get your temperature checked. You need to leave!"" He then went on to steal her phone.
Between mid-March and mid-April around 1,500 attacks or harassment cases were recorded across the United States with most instances occurring in California and New York, according to Stop AAPI Hate, an association of several NGOs in the United States that has launched a hotline to track verbal abuse, assault and hate crimes against Asian- Americans related to the outbreak of COVID-19.
After initial shock, people look for scapegoats
While a social media campaign can't stop violence on its own, Duncan Hwang of the Asian Pacific American Network of Oregon told DW it is important to push back against harmful narratives and highlight the challenges and experiences Asian-Americans are experiencing.
   ""Those incidents really shake people and make them feel uncomfortable to go out. It also normalizes violence against Asian-Americans."" Hwang said.",4130
World: Covid-19 Fueling Anti-Asian Racism and Xenophobia Worldwide,None,Others,2020-05-14,"Governments should take urgent steps to prevent racist and xenophobic violence and discrimination linked to the Covid-19 pandemic while prosecuting racial attacks against Asians and people of Asian descent, Human Rights Watch today. On May 8, 2020, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the pandemic continues to unleash a tsunami of hate and xenophobia, scapegoating and scare-mongering and urged governments to act now to strengthen the immunity of our societies against the virus of hate.
Government leaders and senior officials in some instances have directly or indirectly encouraged hate crimes, racism, or xenophobia by using anti-Chinese rhetoric. Several political parties and groups, including in the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Greece, France, and Germany have also latched onto the Covid-19 crisis to advance anti-immigrant, white supremacist, ultra-nationalist, anti-semitic, and xenophobic conspiracy theories that demonize refugees, foreigners, prominent individuals, and political leaders.
Racism and physical attacks on Asians and people of Asian descent have spread with the Covid-19 pandemic, and government leaders need to act decisively to address the trend, said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director. Governments should act to expand public outreach, promote tolerance, and counter hate speech while aggressively investigating and prosecuting hate crimes.
The UN committee responsible for monitoring compliance with the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which 182 countries have ratified, has recommended that governments adopt national action plans against racial discrimination. Plans should lay out specific approaches to combat racism and discrimination, from enhanced policing of hate crimes to public messaging and education programming encouraging tolerance. Governments need to take urgent action to adopt new action plans to address the wave of Covid-19 racism and xenophobia.",1994
"Man, 57, accused of harassing shoppers","Madden, Karen",Others,2020-05-20,"STEVENS POINT - Police have arrested a 57-year-old man they say hurled racial slurs at grocery shoppers of Asian descent May 12 because they were wearing protective face masks.
The customers said the man called them names and harassed them for wearing masks, said Stevens Point Police Lt. Dana Williams. ""It was an intentional comment made toward Asian victims,"" Williams said.
The Police Department said the man is white but didn't identify the specific ethnicity of the shoppers. However, the department said it has learned members of the Stevens Point Hmong and Asian community have seen an increase in harassment since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Our community will not tolerate disparaging behavior and harassment,"" the Police Department said in a Facebook post. The department ""strongly encourages anyone who may have experienced this type of criminal behavior to contact law enforcement immediately.""
Law enforcement officials in Wisconsin last month noted an uptick of racially motivated incidents related to the coronavirus, noting that harassers had apparently blamed Asian Americans because the pandemic has its origins in China.
The University of Wisconsin-Madison condemned chalk messages on a campus sidewalk blaming the virus on China and held a virtual town hall to warn against any racist or xenophobic acts toward Asian Americans living in Wisconsin.
State Attorney General Josh Kaul has cited a Wisconsin statute that would penalize anyone convicted of a hate crime with a fine up to $10,000 or one year in jail.
Wausau Police Chief Ben Bliven told USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin earlier this spring that there had been one reported incident of what was believed to be a racially motivated incident. Bliven said police did not make an arrest in that instance.
At that same time, Marathon County Sheriff Scott Parks said there were ongoing investigations of people spitting or coughing on others and vandalizing homes and businesses of the county's Asian population.
""They are being victimized because misguided individuals have decided to attack them due to the COVID-19 pandemic that is impacting this nation,"" Parks wrote in a Facebook post.
An officer arrested the man on a suspected charge of disorderly conduct as a hate crime, Williams said. As of Tuesday morning, the man had not been officially charged.
Anyone who is harassed or who sees other people being harassed in Stevens Point should call the Police Department at 715-346-1500. The department is taking the reports seriously and will investigate, Williams said.",2551
Chinese students in US struggle with impact of Covid-19,"Law, Elizabeth",Others,2020-11-03,"For nearly three months at home in Shenyang, high school senior Alan Liu woke up at dinner time every day,
had a quick meal with his family and then logged on to the computer for online classes.
He would then go to bed shortly after breakfast.
Like hundreds of Chinese students, Alan returned home from the US earlier this year to escape the Covid-19
pandemic but the complete difference in schedule, he said, has created minor tensions within the family.
Yet, he is one of the lucky ones - others stuck in the United States have found themselves evicted from hostels,
isolated from their families and, in some cases, caught in the crosshairs of rising US-China tensions.
In September, the US cancelled more than 1,000 Chinese student visas under a presidential measure denying
entry to students and researchers deemed to be security risks
There are nearly 370,000 Chinese students studying in the US, or about one-third of the international student
population in the country.
Many of them pay a significant sum to study at top American institutions but a growing number, like 18-year-old
Steven Yu, are in high school in the US to prepare them for tertiary education.
The Henan native, who is attending a school in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was unable to return home earlier
this year after flights were repeatedly cancelled as the pandemic swept the globe. After rescheduling his flight
five times, Steven decided it was just not worth the trouble.
""Of course, there were scalpers selling tickets but these were going for nearly 100,000 yuan (S$20,600), it's
ridiculous especially when you know someone else is profiteering from this,"" he told The Straits Times.
But remaining in the US has led to other challenges; the high school senior has been unable to take the SATs,
usually a requirement for university applications in the country.
""In theory we could drive four hours to the nearest town where there's an open test centre, but I don't have a
driver's licence or a car, and the bus does not start till dawn.

stays. So if the test starts at 8am, what options do I have?"" he said.
Many of those who choose to remain in the US are from more modest family backgrounds, the teenager added,
and they have been trying not to ask their parents for more money so as to not worry them.
While most US colleges have made SATs optional for applicants this year, Steven said there is still difficulty in
applying for schools.
For others who have made it to university, freshman year during a pandemic has also proven challenging:
orientation parties and gatherings, usually key in welcoming students to schools, have been curbed.
During his three months in college, engineering student Caleb Jian found himself in quarantine twice after
Covid-19 cases occurred in his student dormitory in a university on the east coast.
""In the beginning, the school was testing us once a week to make sure that we were clear of the virus but now
they have stopped because there are too many cases,"" he said.

""It's as though getting the virus is a badge of honour because when they recover, they feel invincible.""
Mr Jian requested that his university not be named and a pseudonym be used because he is the only Asian
student in the dormitory, and worries that he would face even more discrimination should it be found that he
had complained.
He plans to return to China within the year but has found it difficult to renew his passport because the
Chinese consulates in the US have been closed.
But those who have returned home are struggling to keep up with the huge time difference as they continue
virtual lessons.
High school senior Lily Chen, 19, who went to school in California, said that she even fell asleep during a term
test.
""It was a nightmare I completely slept through my calculus paper and when I woke up, it was over,"" she said,
adding that she ""cried and cried"" after the incident and considered stopping school.
But she still hopes to go back to the US next year.

Asian Americans are facing an epidemic of racism,"Bueno, Noemi",Others,2020-11-15,"A Japanese jazz pianist was trying to get to his New York City home one September night when he was brutally
attacked by eight teens.
He suffered fractures in his right arm and shoulder, a broken collarbone, and bruises all over his body and head.
He has not been able to play the piano since the attack. He told The New York Times he remembers at least one
of the teens calling him Chinese and using a profanity.
In late 2019, the first case of novel coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China. Since then, the world has seen
more than 52 million cases and more than 1.2 million deaths.
COVID-19 has put all Americans in harm’s way, but it has made life particularly unsafe for the Asian American
community. We need to do something about this.
Hate crimes and microaggressions against those in the Asian American community have increased since the
beginning of the pandemic. More than 2,000 race-related hate incidents against Asian Americans were reported
between March and June. That’s reported incidents. No one knows for sure how many incidents have gone
unreported.
Asian Americans live in a constant loop of microaggressions and hate because of ignorance and racism.
Incumbent President Donald J. Trump’s rhetoric has further incited anti-Asian sentiments.
When an Asian American reporter, Weijia Jiang of CBS News, asked Trump a question in May about his handling
of the pandemic, he responded by blaming China: “Maybe that is a question you should ask China. Don’t ask
me. Ask China that question.”
Trump continually relies on aggressive language when describing the virus. He has compared himself to a
wartime president fighting an unseen enemy. His word choices villainize Chinese Americans as the enemy and
encourage hatred toward them.
Calling COVID-19 the “Chinese virus” is a racist microaggression that directly hurts Asian Americans and it fuels
mistrust and hatred.
Unfortunately, anti-Asian racism is not new in the United States, and history tends to repeat itself. The Chinese
Exclusion Act of 1882 prohibited the immigration of all Chinese laborers; that law wasn’t repealed until 1943.
In 2020, however, it’s abundantly clear that Asian Americans are fighting two pandemics: anti-Asian racism and
a deadly virus.

"Black Lives Matter has increased racial tension, 55% say in UK poll","Booth, Robert",Others,2020-11-27,"Organisers of BLM say findings show movement has exposed pre-existing fault lines
A majority of people believe Black Lives Matter, the anti-racism movement that spread across the UK this
summer, has increased racial tension, according to a poll.
Just over half (55%) of UK adults believe the BLM protests that took place in big cities but also in the Shetland
Islands and the Isle of Wight, increased racial tensions, according to a survey of more than 2,000 people by
pollsters Opinium. Only 17% of the people polled in October disagreed. The polling also showed 44% of ethnic
minorities felt BLM increased racial tensions.
The findings, which BLM organisers said showed the movement has exposed existing fault lines, comes
alongside parallel research indicating sharp rises in the number of black people saying they faced discrimination
in the last year rising from 74% in 2019 to 81%. In a possible sign of racism arising from the origin of Covid-19
in Wuhan, the proportion of Chinese people saying they faced discrimination over the same period rose from
68% to 76%, according to polling carried out in June.
Opinium’s annual survey of multicultural Britain also found that 71% of Asian people had suffered discrimination
or abuse because of their ethnicity rising to 81% among black people.
“A particularly worrying find is that the majority of BAME people have faced discrimination because of their race and ethnicity,” said Mete Coban, the director of My Life My Say, a youth-led charity aimed at increasing
engagement with democracy. “Another saddening finding is that 46% of BAME people have faced discrimination
on multiple occasions, which is an increase from last year.”
White people were more likely to believe the BLM movement, which was given fresh momentum by global
outrage at the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May, had increased racial tensions, Opinium found.
Those citing that concern most were Conservative voters, with 78% saying they believed it had inflamed
tensions and just 6% saying it hadn’t.
Race relations experts point out that senior Conservatives attacked BLM in forthright language, with the former
chancellor Sajid Javid saying last month it was “neo-Marxist” and “not a force for good”. Kemi Badenoch, the
equalities minister, has urged schools not to support the “political” movement in teaching.
Asked about the survey, Adam Elliott-Cooper, a spokesman for BLM, said racial tensions in Britain long preceded
the movement and that it had highlighted the issue.
“To say that to challenge racism increases racial tension is a very misleading assumption,” he said. “Black LivesMatter hasn’t increased racial tension in the same way as the civil rights movement in the US didn’t or the anti-
apartheid movement in South Africa didn’t. They haven’t increased racial tension but they might have made itmore apparent and exposed what is there.”
The resurgence of the BLM movement this year triggered a series of actions which many felt were overdue, but
others found controversial. These included the into Bristol’s dock and a wave of investigations into British
institutions’ slavery links. A 2017 book by Reni Eddo-Lodge called Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People
About Race,.
Prof Kalwant Bhopal, director of the Centre for Research in Race and Education at the University of Birmingham,
said the results suggested BLM had made some white people “feel their privilege is being threatened and
questioned”.
“When they see something like BLM they do what they can to protect it and there is a backlash,” she said. She
added that the response of some institutions, such as universities, to pledge support for the goals of BLM, had
created a “mask of inclusion” which obscured a reluctance to deliver real change. This was seen by some
minority ethnic people as evidence of division, she said.

Lawyer's anti-racism leadership lights the way for action,"Eikenburg, Jocelyn",Others,2020-11-17,"This year has witnessed an alarming spike in hate incidents against Asians around the world. The surge of
openly racist and xenophobic attacks has only exacerbated the dark reality of a cruel pandemic overshadowing
the globe.
But this tragic situation has also sparked hopeful activism, forging some new heroes in the battle against racism
and discrimination - including Xiaojiu Zhu PhD, MBE, a distinguished lawyer at the Cruickshanks firm in London,
the United Kingdom.
In the face of rising reports of discrimination against the Chinese community in the UK, including stories of
children being targeted at school, Zhu believed something needed to be done. And as a lawyer, she considered it
her duty to help people in the Chinese community protect their interests and legal rights.
Zhu came up with the idea of having an online forum for Chinese communities on responding to racism during
the pandemic. The May 27 event, organized by the UK Beijing Association, the UK Society of Chinese Lawyers,
and the Roundtable of Southern California Chinese-American Organizations, featured keynote speakers -
including Zhu - who encouraged people to take positive actions against racism and discrimination, such as
reporting incidents to authorities and taking legal recourse.
More than 8,000 people from over 10 countries attended the forum, and the online replay attracted some
10,000 views. This extraordinary reception was a testament to the significance of racism to Chinese around the world, and made Zhu realize the need for an international group to forward the cause.
Building on this momentum, Zhu founded the International Chinese Alliance Against Racism (ICAAR), uniting
over 100 lawyers, leaders of Chinese communities and media representatives from over 30 countries and
regions to inspire Chinese around the world to combat racial discrimination. Every day, members of the WeChat
group share and exchange information on the topic, to raise awareness and spur more people to safeguard their
rights. And in the future, Zhu hopes to expand and strengthen the alliance by inviting more individuals to join in
while also ramping up efforts to promote the group.
While Zhu's leadership has arrived at an urgent time, I believe the international Chinese community has long
needed a prominent lawyer to champion this cause. Racial discrimination didn't begin with the COVID-19
pandemic. And victims living in a foreign country may not always understand their rights under the law or even
feel inclined to act, such as filing a police report or a lawsuit. After all, in a March 2020 Chinese-language news
report by China News Service, Zhu noted that most overseas Chinese habitually endure discrimination in silence.
I've observed this sad reality among my Chinese friends in the US, who have shared with me far too many tales
of suffering such indignities on their own, as part of ""eating bitterness"" abroad. But if there had been an
international movement against racism and discrimination, supporting people to stand up for their rights, I
believe my friends' stories may have had ended with something closer to justice.
My hope is that Zhu and the alliance represent a turning point in the international Chinese community and its
allies, a time marked by the emergence of powerful anti-discrimination activism around the world. Her
leadership may galvanize a new generation of Chinese - who in the face of discrimination, may choose courage
and action, confident in the knowledge that they are not alone in this fight.

"Trump 'seemingly legitimizing' the rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans, according to a UN report","Davis, Charles",Others,2020-10-15,"Hate crimes against Asian-Americans have reached an ""alarming level"" amid the COVID-19 pandemic, United Nations officials said.
In a report made public this week, UN officials expressed ""serious concern over the rising wave of racist and xenophobic attacks,"" which they said President Trump is
""seemingly legitimizing.""
Asian-American groups have asked public officials such as Trump to refrain from using terms such as ""China virus"" to refer to COVID-19.
""Our data and evidence of the real-life stories confirm that Asian-Americans are facing increasing racist and xenophobic attacks, catalyzed by rhetoric from the
president and other government leadership,"" said Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council.
Hate crimes against Asian-Americans have reached an ""alarming level"" across the United States, in part because President Donald Trump appears to validate the
perpetrators' bigotry, according to a report by United Nations officials made public this week.
Citing more than 1,800 racist incidents against Asian Americans from March to May 2020, the report — signed by the UN's special rapporteurs on racism and migrant
rights, as well as the head of the international body's working group on discrimination against women — expresses ""serious concern over the rising wave of racist and
xenophobic attacks,"" particularly in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
US authorities, it said, have ""utterly failed to take the steps required to detect, monitor, and prevent racist and xenophobic incidents,"" resulting in a ""state of impunity""
for hateful chauvinists.
In April, Senate Democrats sent a letter to Trump noting guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advising against terms, such as ""Chinese
virus"" and ""Wuhan virus,"" that ""exacerbate prejudice and discrimination in ways that place lives at risk of violence.""
Trump has disregarded that advice, telling Fox News just this past Sunday that he had ""beat this crazy horrible China virus.""
Asian-Americans, in turn, have reported ever more incidents of bigotry. Between March and August 2020, there were more such incidents — over 2,500 — than at the
start of the pandemic, according to researchers at Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition formed to combat racism during the pandemic.
In one reported incident, a Japanese-American woman walking in Los Angeles, California, with her two-year-old son said a white man rolled down his window and
said, ""Tell your kid when he grows up that China did this all."" On the other side of the country, at a grocery store outside Scranton, Pennsylvania, a man yelled, ""This
pandemic wouldn't have happened if you stayed in your country where you belong,"" punctuated with a racial slur.
""We are further concerned by the documented increase in hate and misogynist speech, including incitement to hatred and racial discrimination in public places and
online, and the contribution of the President of the United States in seemingly legitimizing these violations,"" the report said.
Previous research has suggested there is a link between the president's rhetoric and the skyrocketing incidence of hate crimes that has accompanied his presidency.
In 2017, for example, researchers at Tufts University found that, among test subjects, ""exposure to Trump's prejudiced statements made people more likely to write
offensive things.""
""Our data and evidence of the real-life stories confirm that Asian-Americans are facing increasing racist and xenophobic attacks, catalyzed by rhetoric from the
president and other government leadership,"" Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, and a leader of Stop AAPI Hate,
said in a statement on Wednesday.
In September, House Democrats passed a resolution calling on public officials to condemn anti-Asian racism and refrain from using terms such as ""Chinese virus"" and
""Kung flu."" But Republicans have resisted such pleas. Rep. Jim Jordan, of Ohio, a close Trump ally, dismissed the resolution as ""just another opportunity to attack the
president,"" while Rep. Andy Biggs, of Arizona, deemed it ""woke culture on steroids.""

"KU study finds Asian Americans hit hardest by COVID-19 unemployment, but exactly why is unclear","Conner, Mitchell",Others,2020-10-21,"Four researchers at the University of Kansas found recently
that Asian Americans have been hit harder by
unemployment related to the COVID-19 pandemic than any
other minority group in the United States, but the reason
why isn’t exactly clear.
Since the pandemic took hold in March, Asian Americans
have suffered the greatest percentage of overall job losses
and lost jobs at a 9.7% higher rate than white workers
among those with less education, the study found.
ChangHwan Kim, a KU professor of sociology co-wrote a
new article titled “COVID-19 and the Decline in Asian
American Employment” with university graduate students
Andrew Taeho Kim, Scott Tuttle and Yurong Zhang,
according to a KU news release.
Professor Kim said in the news release that typically in times of economic disaster, Asian Americans have been more or less exempt from the job losses that strike other groups. But with COVID-19, that hasn’t been the case,
he said.
The study narrows this down to two possible explanations: workers are voluntarily leaving their jobs, or they’re
leaving due to discrimination.
“Compared to other racial groups, Asian Americans are more keenly aware of the danger of this virus. It first
affected people in China, then spread to Korea. So Asian Americans know the danger because they hear from
relatives in these countries. Maybe there’s additional concern in their community,” Kim said in the release.
Also uncovered in the study is that the discrimination Asian Americans potentially face in the work environment
due to the pandemic is layered: COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China, and President Donald Trump still
regularly uses racist phrases such as “the China Virus” or “Kung Flu” to describe the deadly respiratory disease.
And while these are the prevailing discrimination factors, underlying them is the level of education a worker has
received.
“For the well-educated workers, they are relatively more secure,” Kim said. “But for the less-educated workers,
it’s actually easier to discriminate. If you look at what happened to African Americans before the pandemic,
usually less-educated workers are more discriminated against in the market.”
The article mentions that the lower level of education that workers have, the more likely it is that their job
involves some form of manual labor or physical interaction with people that workers with higher education may
be in a position to shield themselves from.
“This creates a hostile environment. The FBI has reported that hate crimes against Asian Americans have
increased dramatically because of this,” Kim said.
In the news release, Kim predicted that if a COVID-19 vaccine were made available soon and the economy could
pull itself out of a recession, job numbers for Asian Americans would return to what they were pre-pandemic.
The article has been published virtually in a journal called Research in Social Stratification and Mobility.

Asians swamped with abuse in US,"Zhu, Lia",Others,2020-10-28,"Thousands of cases logged in pandemic of racial slurs whipped up by Republicans
""A man harassed me on the train, forcing me out of the way and shouting racial slurs: 'I agree with Trump... it's
because of you, the Chinese, we have to wear masks.""
That was one of the more than 2,700 incidents that STOP AAPI Hate, a platform for people to report
coronavirus-related instances of racism, has received from across the United States over the past eight months.
There were at least 46 racially motivated attacks in which US President Donald Trump is invoked, according to
Russell Jeung, chair and professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University, who compiled
the incidents.
""Another said 'Trump's going to f---you, f------Asian piece of----'... so there's a lot of profanity,"" said Jeung, who
couldn't finish reading the example at a recent webinar because of the expletives.
The rhetoric and policies of Trump and his Republican allies have resurrected the centuries-old ""yellow peril""
stereotype, as reflected by millions of racist retweets and thousands of anti-Asian incidents, Jeung said.
Researchers at the University of Michigan, the University of Washington, the University of Maryland and San
Francisco State University recently conducted a study on how often politicians use the stigmatizing rhetoric
about Asian Americans and the reach of that rhetoric by examining tweets issued by Democratic and Republican election candidates for the offices of president, vice-president and US senator.
The study focuses on the first eight months of the COVID-19 pandemic to Aug 31, and searches specifically
made for tweets that contain terms such as ""Asian American"", ""Wuhan ""and ""virus"". The search returned 1,227
tweets in total.
Of those tweets, 136 used or defended the use of stigmatizing terms such as ""Chinese virus"", though the World
Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise against using terms that
associate disease with a specific group of people or a place, said Melissa Borja, the lead researcher of the study,
and assistant professor of American culture at the University of Michigan.
Partisan division
She noted there is ""a very clear partisan divide"" in how candidates talk about China and Asian Americans.
""Republicans account for all of the tweets that use stigmatizing rhetoric, and for almost all the tweets that
criticized China,"" Borja said.
""In contrast, Democrats did not use any stigmatizing rhetoric in their tweets. In addition, Democrats account for
almost all of the tweets that showed support for Asian Americans, especially in relation to COVID-related
racism.""
Trump and Republican senatorial candidates Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee accounted
for 93 percent of the tweets that use stigmatizing rhetoric.
In the latest report by STOP AAPI Hate, Jeung identified 24 anti-Asian policies introduced or passed in 2020 that
blame China for the COVID-19 pandemic, bar Chinese international students and researchers from entering the
US, restrict business and trade with China, and allow people to sue China in US courts.
""All these policies combined illustrate the anti-immigrant trend and pattern of discrimination employed by the
Republican Party,"" said Jeung.

"NYPD Forms Asian Hate Crime Task Force; In New York City, hate crimes against Asian people rose during the coronavirus pandemic","Li, Shan; Chapman, Ben",Others,2020-10-18,"The New York Police Department is forming an Asian Hate Crime Task Force, its first-ever task force dedicated to investigating crimes targeting a single race.
The city has seen a rise in hate crimes directed at Asian people since the coronavirus pandemic began, the NYPD said. Staffed by 25 detectives of Asian descent who
speak a combined nine Asian languages, the group is tasked with guiding victims through the justice system, from reporting a crime all the way to prosecution. It
will remain after the pandemic, the NYPD said.
""When a victim looks at an Asian cop, they'll see, 'Oh he reminds me of my brother, or my son,'"" said Stewart Loo, the NYPD deputy inspector who heads the task
force. ""It gives them some comfort level.""
The nation's largest police department logged 23 incidents of coronavirus hate crimes, a separate category created this year to track crimes targeting someone for
their identity based on the perception that it has something to do with Covid-19. All but one targeted New Yorkers of Asian descent.
Hate crimes overall have plunged in the city, according to NYPD data. There were 206 hate crimes recorded by the NYPD between Jan. 1 and Sept. 27, down 33%
compared with 308 in the same period a year ago. Incidents of anti-Semitism, which account for the majority of hate crimes reported in the city, fell 50%.
Deputy Inspector Mark Molinari, commanding officer of NYPD's Hate Crime Task Force, said he wasn't surprised when crimes rose against Asian people. The origins
of the virus in China, he said, would inspire some people to irrationally blame Asian-Americans.
But what he hadn't foreseen was the reluctance of some victims to cooperate with authorities—some driven by fear of law enforcement, others by a lack of English
proficiency, and still more who worried about their troubles going public, he said.
""They would not answer our phone call, they would not answer the door for us,"" Mr. Molinari said.
When he discussed these problems during a virtual town hall with the public, Mr. Loo, a commanding officer at the Manhattan South Detective Bureau, reached out
with a proposal: create a team of Asian-American officers to investigate crimes that involve Asian victims or witnesses.
So far, officers on the task force have been sent out to chat with Asian victims in person, and have successfully convinced some to report crimes, Mr. Loo said. The
officers are loaned to the task force as needed, but also have full-time jobs elsewhere in the department.
Mr. Loo, who immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan as a child in 1983, said his father was robbed multiple times working as a delivery man for Chinese restaurants in
Manhattan during the 1980s. He would serve as a translator between his dad and the police, he said.
""I was kind of like 8 or 9 years old, trying to translate, trying to get through,"" he said. ""It was tough.""
Those experiences partly inspired him to join the NYPD in 2000, he said.
""With Covid and the whole anti-Asian sentiment, it's a very uncomfortable feeling being out in public,"" he said.
Coronavirus-related hate crimes have occurred in neighborhoods in all five boroughs of the city except Staten Island, NYPD data showed. Manhattan has
experienced the most, with 13 incidents, followed by five in Brooklyn, three in Queens and two in the Bronx. Arrests have been made in 15 cases.
In one March incident, the police said, a group of four teenage girls approached a 51-year-old woman on an MTA bus in the Bronx. The teens attacked the woman,
made anti-Asian statements and struck her in her head with an umbrella before fleeing the bus. The woman was taken to a local hospital where she received stitches for a laceration to her head.
The new task force is staffed by 25 detectives of Asian descent who speak a combined nine Asian languages. PHOTO: José A. Alvarado Jr. for The Wall Street Journal
Three 15-year-old girls, who were apprehended near the scene a short time after the incident, were arrested and charged with hate-crime assaults, menacing and
harassment. One teen wasn't apprehended.
In another case in September, a man on a bicycle began yelling anti-Asian statements at a man and his female companion who were walking on Broadway in
Manhattan near Union Square. The man on the bicycle then assaulted the man with his bicycle and his backpack, before fleeing on the bicycle. Nobody was injured,
and no arrests were made.
Alice Wong, chief of staff at the Chinese-American Planning Council in New York City, said many of her friends and family started fearing for their safety after the
pandemic hit. Some people blamed Asians for the virus, or would avoid Asian people or businesses out of a misguided fear that they would get Covid-19, she said.
Ms. Wong, who hasn't been the victim of a crime, said she has talked to the NYPD since March to voice her concern about anti-Asian sentiment and crimes and
share concerns she hears from others in the community.
""Everyone thought it was a matter of time before someone said something derogatory or someone hurt them or someone said they should go back to their country,""
she said.

"Citizenship study guide should tell the truth; We cannot hide enduring racism, say Anne-Emanuelle Birn, Amaya Perez- Brumer, Angela Mashford-Pringle, Lisa Forman and Roberta K. Timothy","Anne-Emanuelle Birn Amaya Perez- Brumer Angela Mashford-Pringle Lisa Forman; Timothy, Roberta K",Others,2020-10-17,"At this crucial time of confronting systemic anti-Black and anti-Indigenous racism, the Canadian government
must take responsibility for its enduring role in propagating racism. This includes through its misleading self-
portrayal in Discover Canada, the official study guide for the test taken by Canadian citizenship applicants.
Issued in 2011, the guide aims to teach prospective citizens about Canada's history, geography, culture, and
political and justice systems. Disgracefully, the document whitewashes colonialism, conceals genocide,
minimizes systemic racism and its inhumane consequences, and portrays these as remnants of the past even as
the guide itself engages in racist discourse.
We write as female faculty members at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto. Our
perspective on these issues is borne of our shared concerns yet differing relationships to ""Canadian"" nationality.
One of us is Algonquin (Timiskaming First Nation), another is a woman of African ancestry, born in Canada, surviving transatlantic enslavement, two are new-ish Canadians (white European heritage, from the United
States and South Africa), another is a permanent resident from the U.S. (from Venezuela).
Recognizing Discover Canada's flaws, the government set out in 2016 to remove certain offensive elements,
including the portrayal of immigrants'""barbaric cultural practices"" and the glorification of military exploits.
A draft shared with The Canadian Press in 2017 incorporated coverage of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission's 2015 report, as well as discussion of discrimination against people of racialized backgrounds,
people with disabilities, LGBTQ2S+ people and other marginalized communities.
Despite an expected 2017 release - during Canada's sesquicentennial - the new version, inexplicably, never
came to light. Outrageously, Discover Canada is still the welcome guide for new Canadians. Just a few of its
shameful elements include: 1. It presents a sanitized account of Indigenous peoples, before and under
colonization. This erases the history and legacy of stolen lands and dispossession, the upheaval of nations,
cultural genocide, broken treaties, assimilation policies such as residential schools, police and carceral racism,
continued heinous living conditions on reserves and hugely inequitable health outcomes.
From the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which states Indigenous people are sovereign, to the British North
America Act of 1867, there is no discussion of how the Doctrine of Discovery shaped the nation. Discover
Canada also omits Indigenous people's resistance movements, past and present, that contest historical and
ongoing forms of colonialism and oppression. 2. The guide celebrates Upper Canada as ""the first province in the
Empire to move toward abolition"" and as a ""safe haven"" for enslaved Black people escaping the United States.
But there is no mention of Canada's own history of slavery, nor of the pervasive racist violence and human
rights violations faced by African and Black Canadians. The guide's omission of the Code Noir (1685, revised in
1789) further erases the reality of policed and enslaved African lives, which included forced religious conversion,
sanctioned punishment and other brutalities.
This legacy, combined with successor policies, has generated overrepresentation of Black and Indigenous
children in foster care and Children's Aid facilities and high rates of educational, food and housing insecurity, all
generating worse health outcomes among Black Canadians.
Likewise, anti-Asian racism is covered only superficially. The horrendous Komagata Maru event is overlooked.
The internment of Japanese-Canadians during the Second World War is discussed fleetingly, with no mention of
numbers affected (over 22,000), uncompensated liquidation of property, family separation or forced postwar
relocation.
The guide flags government apologies, but not the racist ideologies and practices justifying such policies. This is
the case with anti-Chinese discrimination, including the ""Head Tax, a race-based entry fee,"" and more recently
witnessed in hateful attacks on Asian Canadians during both the SARS and COVID-19 pandemics. 3. Amid
overwhelming, long-standing evidence of systemic police brutality targeting racialized communities, the guide's
use of the phrase, ""Remember, the police are there to help you"" contradicts the everyday reality of policing for
Black, brown and Indigenous peoples. This includes: repeated instances of violence, racial profiling and
harassment against Black and Indigenous communities, the RCMP's complicity in missing and murdered
Indigenous women and girls, and grossly disproportional incarceration of Black and Indigenous populations. 4.
In discussing the 1982 Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the guide is highly selective regarding which rights are
acknowledged and emphasized. While the guide repeatedly stresses the importance of religious freedom, it fails
to mention equality and non-discrimination as fundamental rights. This selective presentation of key human
rights protections gives prospective citizens a distorted picture.
The guide also misses the opportunity to endorse key human rights protections against racism, which are
central to mitigating the effects of systemic discrimination on people's well-being, financial security, education
and work aspirations.
Additionally ignored are past and contemporary policies that undermine the rights of racialized migrant
workers. Examples of these groups include Black migrants, who historically were only admitted as domestic
workers or in other menial roles; Filipino workers recruited to be home care aides and personal support
workers; and Latin American and Caribbean migrant farm workers today. Racialized migrants are frequently
denied landed immigrant status, family reunification, provincial health coverage, unemployment benefits,
workplace protections and other social entitlements and worker protections.
A replacement citizenship guide is long overdue. A new guide should further highlight working-class struggles
pushing Canada's efforts in realizing rights to health, education and social security, including the role of old
age security pensions in reducing poverty among seniors.
Even so, these measures have been markedly scaled back in recent years, with resultant increases in poverty.
They have never fully addressed racial, class and gender inequities.
A new citizenship guide must also acknowledge ongoing patterns of institutional oppression if we are to begin
to address them. Building on resources such as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Canadian
Human Rights Tribunal's rulings, a revised citizenship guide should reaffirm the importance of respecting
everyone's human rights as outlined in the charter.
We urge the federal government to issue a new citizenship guide that accurately reflects the past and
recognizes current challenges of redressing systemic racism and pervasive social and economic inequalities.
This is a pivotal first step in ensuring dignified futures for new Canadians, and building a society that fosters
equity, human rights, and social, economic and cultural respect. Anne-Emanuelle Birn is professor of critical

Reports of hate up for county New report shows Anne Arundel second in the state for bias incidents,"Sanchez, Olivia",Others,2020-10-14,"Reports of hate crimes and bias incidents in Anne Arundel County increased slightly in 2019. However, Montgomery
County surpassed Anne Arundel as the jurisdiction with the highest instance of reports in the state, according to a new
report from the Maryland State Police.
The State of Maryland 2019 Hate Bias Report shows 81 reports of hate crimes or bias incidents in 2019, up from 78 in
2018, continuing the trend of increases beginning in 2014. Many of the incidents were reported in the northern part of
Anne Arundel County, with a heat map showing each zip code by color based on the range of incidents
reported.Between 12 and 19 incidents reported in Pasadena ZIP code 21122; and between six and 11 incidents reported
in each of Glen Burnie ZIP codes 21060 and 21061 and in Millersville ZIP code 21108.
These numbers include both hate crimes - or a crime motivated by prejudice - and hate bias incidents, which do not rise
to the level of criminal charges.
The report distinguishes incidents as verified, meaning an ""investigation leads a reasonable and prudent person to
conclude that the offender's actions were motivated, in whole or in part, by their bias""; inconclusive, meaning the
evidence is conflicting or incomplete; or unfounded, meaning that evidence or an investigation ""definitively indicates
that it was not motivated by bias.""
Of Anne Arundel County's 81 reported hate bias incidents, five were verified, 72 were inconclusive and 4 were
unfounded. Prince George's County accounted for the most verified incidents with 29, 87.9% of the total number of
reports of incidents in the county.
House Minority Leader Del. Nic Kipke said he thinks it's wrong to assume that Pasadena is more racist than any other
part of the county because of its incident counts. Perhaps reporting has increased due to increased attention to racial
discrimination over the past few years.
""We are trying to stop these types of things from happening,"" Kipke said. ""Our entire community condemns racism, and
we are all invested to ensure that those problems end.""
County and state officials were alarmed after last year's report showed Anne Arundel with the highest numbers of
reports.
In response, County Executive Steuart Pittman moved to treat racism as a public health issue; attended training on
policymaking through a racial equity lens; organized an educational hate bias forum in February with the Human
Relations Commission; established an Office of Health Equity and Racial Justice within the health department; and
amended the county slogan to: ""The best place for all.""
The findings of the report underscore that the county's slogan is aspirational, Pittman said.
He said he wouldn't have expected these efforts to curb racism would affect the data immediately but hopes it will make
the county a safer and more equitable place for all people.
He said that last year's report showing Anne Arundel at the top of the list served as a wake-up call, driving county
officials to act. But moving below Montgomery County isn't good news.
""I don't celebrate the fact that Montgomery County had more - that's also bad news,"" Pittman said.
Since state police released this report last year, Pasadena has seen a flurry of activism. Young organizers made it the
site of several demonstrations for racial justice over the summer as communities across the nation grappled with
systemic racism and police brutality, and hyperlocal groups like One Pasadena have popped up to address racism.
Harry Freeman, a member of the group's steering committee, said the group was founded after the publication of last
year's hate bias report.
Now, he said, they are trying to remind the community that, ""These are real stories that affect real people.""
The group doesn't view racism along strictly political party lines but as a cultural and historical problem. Nor does the
group view racism purely as a Black versus white issue, Freeman said, noting that Latinos and Asian Americans also
experience discrimination.
""The thing about racism is that it's not genetic. It's not something you're born with,"" Freeman said. ""You're either
overtly taught to hate, or it's learned.""
Across the state, more than 64% of incidents appear to be motivated by bias related to race, ethnicity or ancestry.
In Anne Arundel County, these race motivated incidents include: an effigy hung on the property of the county's first
Black councilman last October that was said to be a Halloween stunt, a swastika found at South River High School, or a
racist video made by students at Northeast High School.
Elementary and secondary schools are the most common location for people to report hate bias incidents across the
state, followed closely by homes, according to the report.
Pittman said every incident reported to county police is referred to the Anne Arundel Crisis Response, and victims are
offered support or connected with counseling services if needed.
Since last year's report was released, Anne Arundel state legislators strengthened hate crime laws by making it illegal to
threaten or intimidate a group or individual with symbols including nooses or swastikas. The legislation was championed
by Del. Mark Chang, D-Glen Burnie, who is one of the first Korean Americans to be elected to serve in Maryland's
General Assembly.
It passed this year, in a session shortened by the coronavirus pandemic, after two failures during the two previous
sessions. The new law took effect on Oct. 1.
In testimony for the bill, Chang recounted the story of discovering a dead cat hanging from a noose in his yard
shortly after immigrating to the United States. He was 7, he said, but he carries the trauma of that experience to this
day.
He said he hopes the new law, and the punishments that come with violating it, will deter people from bias-motivated
behavior, but the work of the legislature to ""eradicate hate"" is not done.
Though the data does not reflect the past seven months of the coronavirus pandemic, Chang said he has faced
discrimination due to his Asian American identity.
Despite guidance from the World Health Organization to avoid referring to the virus by names that include geographic
locations, President Donald Trump has continued to do so as recently as last week, while he is recovering from the
virus himself.
Chang called the narrative disgusting and said he was very disappointed it has seeped into this community.
""I have the honor of being a representative,"" he said. ""I just wonder, for those who are not in that position, what are
they experiencing?""

racism a preexisting condition: COVID-19 statistics reveal how it 'still has its grip' on America,"Gomez, Alan; Grantham-Philips, Wyatte; Hughes, Trevor; Jervis, Rick; Plevin, Rebecca; Stanley, Kameel; Wagner, Dennis; Marco della Cava; Deborah Barfield Berry; Nichols, Mark",Others,2020-10-17,"A Louisiana pastor prays as his parishioners die, first from cancer and now from COVID-19. An Indigenous community in New Mexico lacks adequate health care as the death toll mounts. A sick hospital worker in New
Jersey frets about infecting others in her heavily populated neighborhood.
As the country cries out for a vaccine and a return to normal, lost in the policy debates is the reality that COVID-19 kills far more people of color than white Americans. This isn't a matter of coincidence, poor choices or
bad luck – it's by design.
A team of USA TODAY reporters explored how the policies of the past and present have made Black, Asian, Hispanic and Indigenous Americans prime targets for COVID-19. They found:
America's education and economic systems are still unequal, disproportionately leaving people of color out of higher-wage jobs. When COVID-19 struck, more people of color were serving as essential workers directly in
the path of the virus.
Decades of discrimination in housing corralled people of color into tightly packed neighborhoods, fueling the virus' spread. Those neighborhoods tend to lie in ""food deserts,"" leading to diabetes, obesity and heart
disease that make people more likely to die from the virus.
Environmental policies designed by white power brokers at the expense of the poor have poisoned the air they breathe, fueling cancers and leaving communities weakened in the path of the virus. A lack of federal
funding left the most vulnerable communities cut off from health care at the most critical moment.
Put simply, America's history of racism was itself a preexisting condition.
Of the 10 U.S. counties with the highest death rates from COVID-19, seven have populations where people of color make up the majority, according to data compiled by USA TODAY. Of the top 50 counties with the
highest death rates, 31 are populated mostly by people of color.
""COVID-19 has brought out into the open, with painful clarity, these divisions in our society that have been there for a long time but, for one reason or another, people were able to overlook them,"" said Philip
Landrigan, director of the Global Public Health Program at Boston College.
With nearly 1,000 people a day dying from the virus and scientists scrambling to grasp exactly how the virus spreads and kills, federal and state data has not provided enough demographic detail to show the full impact
on communities of color. The race and ethnicity of people who contract the virus is known in 52% of cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But study after study has shown clear patterns in whom the virus kills.
Black people are more than twice as likely to die from the virus than white people, and Hispanics and Native Americans are 1.5 times more likely to die, according to The COVID Tracking Project.
""You can't change the fact that America is so segregated and that people of color tend to live in communities where the environmental conditions are worse, and that can increase your risk of heart disease or lung
disease and diabetes,"" said Richard Besser, former acting director of the CDC and president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the nation's largest philanthropy dedicated solely to health care. ""You can't
change that in the short run.""
A team of USA TODAY reporters pored over lawsuits challenging housing and health care policies, analyzed demographic data for communities hit hardest by COVID-19 and studied documents that reveal how
government and business leaders worked together to marginalize populations. They interviewed the descendants of enslaved Americans who were denied homeownership in white neighborhoods and Indigenous
Americans who had been funneled into reservations in exchange for federally funded health care that never came. They walked through Black communities on the fence line of polluting chemical plants, spent time with
Latino farm workers unable to afford the very food they harvested, and entered the homes of Asian immigrants afraid of being attacked by neighbors if they tested positive for the coronavirus.
Housing policies speed spread of virus
In Essex County, New Jersey, decades of housing policies, laws and unspoken pacts excluded communities of color from spacious suburbs and forced them to cram into poor, often neglected neighborhoods in the urban
core of Newark. Now, Essex has the 12th-highest death rate from COVID-19 in the country, according to data compiled by USA TODAY, fueled in large part by the high numbers of Black Americans living in segregated,
low-income neighborhoods.
That includes Ahou Yao, 40, a respiratory therapist at a local hospital who contracted COVID-19 in April and was forced to self-isolate in her bedroom in the two-bedroom apartment she shares with her husband and
two young boys. She struggled from fever, shortness of breath and body aches and was unable to work for a month. Her husband had to go out for food, run errands and navigate their crowded neighborhood.
""Now I'm scared,"" she said, ""scared that he has it, too.""
Her husband has since developed a cough and chest pains, prompting a trip to the emergency room. He started self-isolating, passing the responsibility of venturing outside back to his wife.
Environmental policies make people vulnerable
In Louisiana, along a stretch of the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, former slave plantations house massive chemical plants that spew chemicals deemed dangerous by the Environmental
Protection Agency. When the plants were constructed, white homeowners had the means to move away, in time leaving a mostly Black population to breathe toxic air and suffer from such high rates of cancer that the
entire region was dubbed ""Cancer Alley.""
One of those plants, in St. John the Baptist Parish, is the only one in the nation that produces neoprene. The synthetic rubber is used to make wetsuits and laptop cases, and the emissions from the production process
are so harmful that the EPA lists the predominantly Black neighborhood next door to the plant as having the highest risk of cancer in the entire country. In September, St. John the Baptist Parish had the 27th highest
death rate from COVID-19 in the nation, according to a USA TODAY analysis.
The Rev. Lionel Murphy of the Tchoupitoulas Chapel, which sits 2 miles from the chloroprene plant, has counseled many Black families over the years as they've come down with diabetes, respiratory illnesses and rare
cancers. Now, he's seeing his neighbors die from COVID-19.
""People get sick, people die, you go bury them,"" Murphy said. ""But there's no fight to erase the problem.""
Health care missing when needed
In McKinley County, New Mexico, many local residents struggle to find health care.
Year after year, Congress has failed to allocate enough money to fulfill its legal obligation to provide health care to Indigenous tribes, including the Navajo, Hopi and Zuni people who make up the majority of McKinley
County's population.
A 2018 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights titled ""Broken Promises"" found the federal government spends nearly four times as much on health per person through government programs than it spends for
each Indigenous person.
That helps explain why McKinley County has the nation's sixth-highest death rate from COVID-19, according to USA TODAY data, with more than 240 people dying in the isolated corner of the state.
Anna Marie Rondon, executive director of the New Mexico Social Justice and Equity Institute in McKinley County (who is Diné, as the Navajo people call themselves), said the ravages of COVID-19 are not an isolated
tragedy but the latest chapter in Indigenous people's long history of abuse and neglect from the U.S. government.
On the Navajo Nation, inadequate resources have resulted in widespread water poverty, food insecurity and high rates of illness. These daily realities were devastating long before the pandemic, but they've also helped
fuel a high COVID-19 death rate.
""It's really an unbelievable chain of oppression – it's still squeezing us, it still has its grip,"" Rondon said. ""And it's still killing us.""
Food deserts make people vulnerable
In California, Imperial Valley is considered the nation's winter breadbasket, producing 80% of the country's fresh vegetables during the cold months. But the predominantly Hispanic workers who pick alfalfa, lettuce,
sugar beets and carrots can rarely afford to buy them.
Nearly 75% of adults and 13% of children are obese or overweight for their age, according to state data. On the other end of the spectrum, 31% of kids in Imperial County don't get enough to eat each day, according
to a 2018 report by Feeding America, a national anti-hunger organization based in Washington, D.C.
""If they're already on food stamps, to spend the extra money to get fruits and vegetables, it's expensive,"" said Jessica Solorio, executive director of Spread the Love, a local food bank.
Those figures show why COVID-19 has been so fatal in the county, with 16 deaths per 10,000, nearly three times the national average, according to the USA TODAY analysis.
Cultural barriers complicate response
In San Francisco, community activists are worried that the number of Asian Americans getting COVID-19 is being vastly underreported.
Of the county's nearly 12,000 positive test results, only 12% are Asian American, yet Asian Americans have made up 38% of the death count. Experts attribute that alarming disconnect to a number of factors, including
the fear of losing a job after a positive test, language barriers, lack of health care, growing anti-Asian hate crimes, and what's called the ""model-minority myth"" – an assumption that education and financial successes
enjoyed by some Asian Americans apply to all 20-some Asian ethnicities.
Judy Young, executive director of the Southeast Asian Development Center, a nonprofit that helps residents from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, said her community suffers from an average household income a quarter
of the city's average, low high school graduation rates and obstacles to health care. Add a COVID-19 testing regime tailored to those proficient in English and an often fatalistic attitude toward the pandemic in the
community, and Young said the virus has been painful to the Asian American community.
""I've asked our clients why they're not getting tested,"" she said. ""Often the reaction I get is, 'I'm going to die anyway, and if I test positive, then I can't go to work.""
'We become invisible'
Ask Beverly Wright, executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, why so many people of color across the U.S. are dying from COVID-19 and she goes back 400 years to the arrival of the first
enslaved Africans to colonial U.S. shores.
Racism is so entrenched in the American way of life, she said, that it's impossible to separate the high death rates of marginalized communities from the nation's historic treatment of each of them. From the broken
promises of reparations to the terrible treatment of immigrants, from redlining practices that excluded Black Americans from homeownership to the GI Bill money that went mostly to white service members returning
from World War II, Wright says COVID-19 is once again revealing the precarious position people of color often find themselves in.
But with no national response from the federal government and only limited actions taken by states or localities, Wright said her people are still stuck in the same situation: invisible.
""We have built-in systems that work against Black people moving up the economic ladder,"" Wright said. ""That pattern continues. Racism is so entrenched that we become invisible.""

Reports of hate up for county New report shows Anne Arundel second in the state for bias incidents,"Sanchez, Olivia",Others,2020-10-12,"Reports of hate crimes and bias incidents in Anne Arundel County increased slightly in 2019. However, Montgomery
County surpassed Anne Arundel as the jurisdiction with the highest instance of reports in the state, according to a new
report from the Maryland State Police.
The State of Maryland 2019 Hate Bias Report shows 81 reports of hate crimes or bias incidents in 2019, up from 78 in
2018, continuing the trend of increases beginning in 2014. Many of the incidents were reported in the northern part of
Anne Arundel County, with a heat map showing each zip code by color based on the range of incidents
reported.Between 12 and 19 incidents reported in Pasadena ZIP code 21122; and between six and 11 incidents reported
in each of Glen Burnie ZIP codes 21060 and 21061 and in Millersville ZIP code 21108.
These numbers include both hate crimes - or a crime motivated by prejudice - and hate bias incidents, which do not rise
to the level of criminal charges.
The report distinguishes incidents as verified, meaning an ""investigation leads a reasonable and prudent person to
conclude that the offender's actions were motivated, in whole or in part, by their bias""; inconclusive, meaning the
evidence is conflicting or incomplete, or unfounded, meaning that evidence or an investigation ""definitively indicates
that it was not motivated by bias.""
Of Anne Arundel County's 81 reported hate bias incidents, five were verified, 72 were inconclusive and 4 were
unfounded. Prince George's County accounted for the most verified incidents with 29, 87.9% of the total number of
reports of incidents in the county.
House Minority Leader Del. Nic Kipke said he thinks it's wrong to assume that Pasadena is more racist than any other
part of the county because of its incident counts. Perhaps reporting has increased due to increased attention to racial
discrimination over the past few years.
""We are trying to stop these types of things from happening,"" Kipke said. ""Our entire community condemns racism, and
we are all invested to ensure that those problems end.""
County and state officials were alarmed after last year's report showed Anne Arundel with the highest numbers of
reports.
In response, County Executive Steuart Pittman moved to treat racism as a public health issue; attended training on
policymaking through a racial equity lens; organized an educational hate bias forum in February with the Human
Relations Commission; established an Office of Health Equity and Racial Justice within the health department; and
amended the county slogan to: ""The best place for all.""
The findings of the report underscore that the county's slogan is aspirational, Pittman said.
He said he wouldn't have expected these efforts to curb racism would affect the data immediately but hopes it will make
the county a safer and more equitable place for all people.
He said that last year's report showing Anne Arundel at the top of the list served as a wake-up call, driving county
officials to act. But moving below Montgomery County isn't good news.
""I don't celebrate the fact that Montgomery County had more - that's also bad news,"" Pittman said.
Since state police released this report last year, Pasadena has seen a flurry of activism. Young organizers made it the
site of several demonstrations for racial justice over the summer as communities across the nation grappled with
systemic racism and police brutality, and hyperlocal groups like One Pasadena have popped up to address racism.
Harry Freeman, a member of the group's steering committee, said the group was founded after the publication of last
year's hate bias report.
Now, he said, they are trying to remind the community that, ""These are real stories that affect real people.""
The group doesn't view racism along strictly political party lines but as a cultural and historical problem. Nor does the
group view racism purely as a Black versus white issue, Freeman said, noting that Latinos and Asian Americans also
experience discrimination.
""The thing about racism is that it's not genetic. It's not something you're born with,"" Freeman said. ""You're either
overtly taught to hate, or it's learned.""
Across the state, more than 64% of incidents appear to be motivated by bias related to race, ethnicity or ancestry.
In Anne Arundel County, these race motivated incidents include: an effigy hung on the property of the county's first
Black councilman last October that was said to be a Halloween stunt, a swastika found at South River High School, or a
racist video made by students at Northeast High School.
Elementary and secondary schools are the most common location for people to report hate bias incidents across the
state, followed closely by homes, according to the report.
Pittman said every incident reported to county police is referred to the Anne Arundel Crisis Response, and victims are
offered support or connected with counseling services if needed.
Since last year's report was released, Anne Arundel state legislators strengthened hate crime laws by making it illegal to
threaten or intimidate a group or individual with symbols including nooses or swastikas. The legislation was championed
by Del. Mark Chang, D-Glen Burnie, who is one of the first Korean Americans to be elected to serve in Maryland's
General Assembly.
It passed this year, in a session shortened by the coronavirus pandemic, after two failures during the two previous
sessions. The new law took effect on Oct. 1.
In testimony for the bill, Chang recounted the story of discovering a dead cat hanging from a noose in his yard
shortly after immigrating to the United States. He was 7, he said, but he carries the trauma of that experience to this
day.
He said he hopes the new law, and the punishments that come with violating it, will deter people from bias-motivated
behavior, but the work of the legislature to ""eradicate hate"" is not done.
Though the data does not reflect the past seven months of the coronavirus pandemic, Chang said he has faced
discrimination due to his Asian American identity.
Despite guidance from the World Health Organization to avoid referring to the virus by names that include geographic
locations, President Donald Trump has continued to do so as recently as last week, while he is recovering from the
virus himself.
Chang called the narrative disgusting and said he was very disappointed it has seeped into this community.
""I have the honor of being a representative,"" he said. ""I just wonder, for those who are not in that position, what are
they experiencing?""

What's at stake for AAPI Americans this election,"Kulkarni, Manjusha P, Esq",Others,2020-10-30,"Executive Director
Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council (A3PCON)
""Go f**king die, you chink! All of you chinks brought us the Chinese virus.""
""Chinese, go back to your country.""
These racial slurs are not from 1882; they are commonplace during COVID-19 America.
Unfortunately, discrimination against AAPIs is not new. We saw earlier versions of the ""yellow peril"" propaganda
used to justify the Chinese Exclusion Act as well as the Japanese American incarceration. This year, it is being
used to perpetrate harm on Asian Americans.
These are just two examples of verbal harassment reported to Stop AAPI Hate, the nation's leading aggregator
of COVID-19-re-lated hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, by individuals who experienced
discrimination in the past six months. Stop AAPI Hate was started by my organization, the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council (A3PCON), Chinese for Affirmative Action, and San Francisco State University's Asian
American Studies Department in March 2020 after we began to see a surge of incidents against our community
members in California and across the country. Since we launched, we have received over 2,700 incident reports
from 47 states and the District of Columbia.
Stop AAPI Hate has received firsthand reports of verbal attacks against grandparents walking their infant
grandchild, civil rights violations like workplace discrimination against a doctor and a case of refusal of service
against a young woman in a grocery store, and even physical assaults against students in school and parents at
a pharmacy.
In the past and present, the AAPI community are treated like perpetual foreigners. Yet, America is our country.
Many of us were born here. And others like me came when we were children. We are U.S. citizens and the
fastest growing electorate of any racial or ethnic group, according to the Pew Research Group. In this year's
election, eleven million of us are eligible to vote, making up 5% of the nation's eligible voters. But, in order for
us to be counted and for issues of concern to us to matter to elected leaders, we must vote.
However, according to AAPI Data, only 56% of Asian Americans eligible to vote were registered in the 2016
election compared to 73% of Whites and African Americans and only 84% of Asian Americans turned out to vote
compared with 87% of Whites and 91% of African Americans.
In 2000, A3PCON and our member organizations, serving and representing the 1.5 million AAPIs in Los Angeles
County, got together to ask ourselves important and hard questions: Why are our registered voter numbers so
low? What are the barriers the AAPI community faces that limit their engagement with our electoral process?
And what can we do to empower our community to vote in larger numbers?.
Over the past decade, we have worked with the Los Angeles County Registrar's Office to ensure ballots are
available in multiple Asian languages. That work has paid off and today, individuals can request not only ballots,
but also voter education materials as well as voter assistance services in Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Khmer,
Korean, Tagalog, Thai, Vietnamese, Bengali, Burmese, Gujarati, Indonesian, Mongolian and Telugu. This ensures
that even those in our community who are not able to read and write in English can still participate in our
elections. And A3PCON has sought to make voter guides available in many AAPI languages as well, helping
individuals to understand the options for voting in the 2020 general election and the measures on which they
are deciding California's future.
A lot is at stake and we must engage in the electoral process. We need to build our community power and voting
bloc to elect candidates who will promote inclusive policies that protect our families and communities.
Many have said this is the most important election of our lifetimes. They are not wrong. This is our opportunity
to honor those that came before us and make a difference in our life and the lives of our family members. All we
seek is the safety and well-being of our communities, cities, state, and nation.

"Fear, anxiety still lingers for Metro Atlanta Asian Americans",None,Others,2021-07-06,"After six Asian women were killed in March, Nathalie Espinol was afraid to go places known for attracting Asian American crowds. 
The 34-year-old avoided Asian grocery stores, restaurants, karaoke bars - anywhere that would make her feel ""exposed"" as a Filipina woman. 
Though Espinol has since resumed trips to these spaces, her anxiety remains. Just last month, while shopping at the Duluth MegaMart, she said she felt a ""wave of fear"" as she realized how easily that location could be the subject of another attack. 
""It reminded me that the pain we're carrying with us is always there, and it's hard to predict the triggers that will initiate that fear,"" Espinol said. ""I don't want to have to be fearful everywhere I go, and I don't want to have to deprive myself of going to spaces with other Asian Americans because I'm scared."" 
It's been more than three months since deadly shootings at three Atlanta-area businesses put a spotlight on Asian Americans across the country. As a year's worth of increased hate crimes came to a head and Asian Americans of all generations and ethnicities mobilized, politicians and corporations issued statements promising not to let violence go unnoticed. 
Over three months later, many East and Southeast Asian Americans in metro Atlanta remain afraid of verbal or physical attacks. Some have grown exhausted from coping with that heightened fear while attempting to educate others on their community's struggles through a slowed #StopAAPIHate movement. Many are skeptical that any substantial improvements occurred. 
""I don't think anything has changed since the spa shootings,"" said Angela Jiang, a Singaporean-Taiwanese woman who grew up in Duluth and now lives in Buckhead. ""Nothing was really won besides a lot of resolutions and statements in support of the Asian American community that actually hasn't resulted in any material changes."" 
President Joe Biden signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into effect on May 20. This legislation, introduced by two Asian lawmakers, intended to make reporting ""COVID- 19 hate crimes"" easier and tasked the Department of Justice with expediting hate crime reviews. 
""We are committed to stop the hatred and the bias,"" Biden said as he signed the bill that acknowledged hate crimes as a ""serious national problem."" 
Determining how to prevent incidents before they happen, however, has largely been left to Asian Americans themselves, as national efforts to promote visibility and prevent violence reduced outside Asian American communities. 
The sites of these tragedies reflect this diminished public interest: Aromatherapy and Gold Spas, two of the shooting locations, now appear closed, with no indication of reopening. Where memorial flowers and signs once lined the entrances to those businesses, traffic cones now block the parking lot entrances amid scattered pieces of 
trash. 
Some Asian Americans fear that it will take more headlines and news reports of anti-Asian violence for substantive change to happen. Agnes Scott College student Connie Tran, whose Vietnamese parents run a nail salon in Columbus, said he believes simply condemning hate crimes and increasing investment in law enforcement are surface-level approaches that won't reduce discrimination. 
""I'm a little wary because my mom and the other folks who run Asian-majority businesses feel like sitting ducks, waiting for the next instance to happen,"" Tran said. ""It feels like we're just walking around in a loop and not understanding the root cause of all this violence."" 
A May 2021 report from Asian advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate found that Asian Americans are still ""experiencing unprecedented and growing health inequity issues brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and anti-AAPI hate."" 
While the pandemic worsened mental health for many in this country, researchers said Asian Americans who also encountered anti-Asian racism showed ""elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress and physical symptoms."" 
""It's a responsibility for all of us in the community to be aware of what's happening and talk about it and educate people,"" Espinol said. ""But this burden is falling on top of us having to process this pain happening in our community, and it just feels so overwhelming."" 
Groups like the Asian American Resource Center (AARC), located in Duluth, expanded their mental health programs to field more requests for help. Handling that increased interest, however, takes resources that have slowed in the months since the shootings, said AARC Managing Director Xavier Kim. 
Many like Espinol subsequently became more vigilant in how they proceeded about everyday life, particularly in groups of Asian Americans. For some, that meant staying home more or enrolling in self-defense courses. Others, however, took more drastic measures. 
""We are just scared, so that is the climate right now, it's everybody [being] afraid,"" said Daniel Fu, a 70-year old Indonesian man who purchased a gun after the shootings. 
President of the Korean Restaurant Association Southeast Andy Kim noted that many Asian-owned restaurants have hired security personnel or installed CCTV monitors to deter potential aggressors. 
Keun Soo Lee, who has operated Korean barbecue restaurant Honey Pig since 2007, said it was robbed for the first time after the shootings. Though he has since installed cameras and trained staff on handling anti-Asian violence, Lee worries that disregard for Asian Americans could intensify. 
""As a restaurant owner, the fear of that kind of hatred has increased,"" he said. 
Veterinarian Jamie Cho said that even using her Korean surname is a potential risk. As Cho has opened a new practice, she explained she is more cautious when hiring workers and considered whether to tint the windows. 
""I'm more aware of the decisions I make because I know that just saying nothing and keeping quiet does not mean that I'm safe,"" Cho said. ""I've feared and wondered, could my picture or name affect my success?"" 
Despite slowed momentum and heightened fears, Asian American advocates new and old said they're focused on educating others and maintaining the coalitions that formed in the wake of the shootings. 
A rising battleground to increase Asian American visibility and reduce hate in the long term is K-12 schools, where a group of community members aim to implement Asian American history curriculum. Georgia Korean Chamber of Commerce Vice President of External Affairs Michelle Kang explained that fighting ignorance with education is a first step towards preventing hate. 
""Asian Americans have been here since the 1850s, more than 170 years, but we're still considered as foreigners,"" Kang said. ""It's not right... It's not just white people's history."" 
Allison Wang, a Chinese nurse who helped plan rallies after the shootings, said as hosting in-person events grew ""exhausting,"" making change in schools has become a new source of hope. Having grown up in Tucker without a single course that discussed Asian American experiences, Wang wants to make sure her daughter learns about her heritage.
""I am American, I've been naturalized to become an American citizen, but I'm also Chinese,"" Wang said. ""I would like to have more people ... who appreciate the fact that I am Asian. 
Kang is hopeful increased awareness will help Asian communities from Lebanon to Vietnam 
move forward. 
""We are more vigilant about what's going on outside of the Korean American community,"" Kang said. ""We are watching out for each other."" ",7495
Hate crime charges filed in attack on U.S. Olympian,Randall,Others,2021-09-25,"A man arrested in April in an incident targeting Sakura Kokumai, a member of Team USA's karate team at the Tokyo Olympics, now faces another hate crime charge. 
KTLA reports Michael Orlando Vivona, 26, is suspected of yelling threats and spitting at Kokumai. He already faces multiple hate crime charges in a separate attack on an elderly couple at the same park, Grijalva Park in Orange, California. 
""There was no racial slurs at the beginning,"" Kokumai said back in April. ""As he got into his car he would yell out 'Chinese' and 'Sashimi' and then I was like OK there it is."" 
Kokumai told KTLA she frequently worked out at the park in preparation for the Tokyo Olympics. 
She said she pulled out her phone and began recording when Vivona began acting belligerently toward her. 
According to Fox 11, Vivona is also accused of walking up to a Korean American couple and punching them for no apparent reason. 
The couple often comes to the park to take their daily walk. Police say others there at the time came to help the 79-year-old man and his 80-year old wife. 
`They recognized him from the previous attack on Sakura Kokumai and surrounded him, Sgt. Phil McMullin of the Orange Police Department said. ""There was an officer right there across the street and we arrested him.""

Orange County sees 19 fold increase in anti-Asian hate crimes,Randall,Others,2021-09-18,"The Orange County Human Relations Commission found a 19-fold increase in attacks against Asians Americans, reports the Los Angeles Times. 
The findings analyzing attacks in 2020 mirrors a statewide report which found a 107% increase in hate incidents against Asians. 
""When there are spikes, when there are increases, we have seen an increase locally for anti-Asian hate,"" Mary Anne Foo, executive director of the Orange County Asian Pacific Islander Community Alliance, said to the Voice of OC. 
Foo says part of the spike can be blamed not only on the pandemic, but the rising anti-China sentiment in national and international politics. 
Supervisor Katrina Foley says this sentiment is also reflected in comments made by the public during Board of Supervisor meetings. 
""We hear speakers that, in my opinion, that are often making comments that are truly bigoted and connecting COVID with communism,"" Foley said. ""The public health response to COVID is somehow related to communism and tying it to China. It's very sad to see that happening. I know that [OC Health Officer Dr. Clayton Chau] has taken the brunt of it, (Board) Chairman [Andrew] Do as well."" 
Do told AsAmNews back in July that he's faced racism during his entire six years on the board, but it has increased of late. 
""I think the the language coming from the last administration stoked that fire, legitimized the fringe elements to come out, and and if anything, feel more legitimate,"" said Do who is a Republican. ""They feel like, hey, maybe these racist thoughts that I have are not so out of the ordinary, if people at the very top talk the way I do."" 
The Times reports Black people make up less than 2% of Orange County's population, but were the most targeted. Asian Americans were the most frequently targeted. 
""It really goes without saying that there is a lot of work to be done in our county and across the country,"" said Nhi Nguyen, the hate crime prevention coordinator for the Orange County Human Relations Commission. ",2003
Hate crime reports more than double in Sonoma County,"Chavez, Nashelly",Others,2021-09-20,"When Sebastopol resident Dennis Judd heard about the vandalism of a fountain he commissioned to honor his mother, a Holocaust survivor who died in 2016, it was hard 
for him to believe the crime was a mere coincidence. 
Behind the fountain, which was found toppled and in pieces at Santa Rosa Memorial Park in June of last year, was a mosaic that named 12 of his mother's family members who were killed during the genocide. 
Police have yet to determine whether the vandalism met the definition of a hate crime, but there were 25 other cases in Sonoma County last year that did. 
That number was more than double the number that occurred the year before, according to data released by the FBI. 
As police investigated the fountain vandalism, and two others at the cemetery, Judd focused his efforts on rebuilding the fountain. 
A month later, after donations to a GoFundMe fundraiser seeking help for the repair poured in, the fountain was spouting water again. 
""I think whenever society is challenged, economically or with the pandemic, that makes it easier to come up with blame and hate,"" Judd said. ""And I think the message that needs to be put back out in society, as my mom would talk in her talks about the Holocaust, it was learn to deal with your anger before it translates into hatred."" 
More than a year later, the case has gone cold due to a lack of evidence and a suspect, Santa Rosa Police Department spokesman Sgt. Chris Mahurin said. 
Of the 25 hate crimes last year, four were anti-Jewish. 
Reports of hate crimes motivated by anti-Black bias were the biggest driver of the local increase; a spike that coincided with a national and local reckoning over disproportionate toll of police violence on Black men and women, and other communities of color. 
Statewide and national data show similar trends. 
Teresa Drenick, the deputy regional director for the Anti-Defamation League's Central Pacific region, said increased sensitivity over racial issues in the wake of the local protests, as well as the rise in attacks on Asian American and Pacific Islander community following the COVID-19 pandemic have likely contributed to the rise in hate crime reporting last year. 
""Awareness and urgency to make those reports were heightened in the wake of the social justice movement,"" Drenick said. ""And also, coincidentally, the overt nature of hate crimes really exploded."" 
News item: An unidentified person or group hijacks a Zoom meeting on homeless solutions hosted by the leadership council of Home Sonoma County on July 10, 2020. The digital intruders repeatedly say anti-Black and anti-Semitic slurs, as well as derogatory comments about the LGBT community. 
Hate crimes are defined as offenses that are at least partly motivated by the perpetrator's bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender or gender identity, according to the FBI. 
Unlike hate speech, which directs hatred against a specific group, hate crimes include overt acts of violence, threats, acts of intimidation or plans to commit a crime. 
In 2020, data from the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office and the county's nine municipal law enforcement agencies showed that 10 cases were related to anti-Black bias; four were anti-Latino; four were anti-Jewish; three were directed at gay men; two were anti-LGBT; one was anti-multiracial; and one involving ""anti-other race/ethnicity/ancestry."" 
In 2019, only two of the 11 hate crimes reported to Sonoma County law enforcement agencies were attributed to anti-Black hate, representing a 400% increase. 
Black residents make up 1.5% of the county's population, according to 2020 U.S. Census data. 
The number of reported hate crimes in California rose 32% to 1,339 in 2020. When looking at hate crimes related to anti-Black bias, the data shows those crimes increased by 88%, going from 243 in 2019 to 458 in 2020 statewide. 
Nationally, hate crimes related to anti-Black bias increased 40% between 2019 and 2020, and the hate crime category was the largest both years, as was the case for 
the statewide data. 
Overall, hate crimes in the country increased by 40%. 
Sheba Person-Whitley, executive director of Sonoma County's Economic Development Board, said she was shocked but not surprised by the increases in anti-Black bias- related crimes. 
Her daughter, who is Black and a member of the LGBT community, has faced in-person and online verbal assaults related to her identity while attending high school in Sonoma County, Person-Whitley said. 
She was appalled to hear of last year's Zoom hijacking of a Home Sonoma County meeting, an incident that prompted her to rally around two Black government leaders who were in attendance. 
""Unfortunately, it's almost baked into our culture and our society here in the United States,"" Person-Whitley said. ""We have people on national television saying very bigoted things with no backlash. So, if you have people who already thought that way, they might feel their perspective is validated."" 
News item: A Black delivery driver pulls into a curb to drop-off a package in Rohnert Park's E section on June 19, 2020 when a resident begins yelling racial slurs at him and threatens to kill him. Police find the suspect, but are unable to reach the victim to conduct a photo lineup. 
When examining the factors that may have contributed to the local and statewide increases, Anastasia Tosouni, an associate professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice Studies at Sonoma State University, pointed to the unprecedented confluence of events last year, which saw widespread protests over the murder of George Floyd and broader calls for police reform, as well as a presidential election in which race was a central topic. All of that occurred against the backdrop of the pandemic, which disproportionately affected minority communities. 
Historically, minorities, especially Black Americans, have experienced backlash in the form of hostility when they've asserted their rights in a strong and publicized way, Tosouni said. The country's Civil Rights era is one example. 
The heightened awareness over racial justice-related issues may have also had an impact on local police officers, who ultimately determine whether a crime merits a hate crime classification, Tosouni said. 
Cases that an officer may have not classified as a hate crime in the past, such a fight in which racial slurs were made by one of the parties, may have received that classification in light of the national discourse on race, Tosouni said. 
""It might be the case that hate crimes have increased against Black Americans, or it might be the case that police departments in our country, and California in general are starting to be more assertive,"" Tosouni said. 
News item: A Black family at Lake Sonoma finds the words ""white Pride"" written in the dust of their car on June 21, and a friend files an online police report. While the report is classified as a hate crime, deputies determine the vehicle is not damaged, and therefore no crime occurred. 
Santa Rosa, Sonoma County's most populous city, recorded 11 of the local hate crime reports last year, the most of any local agency, the FBI data shows. 
It was more than twice as many as the five the department reported in 2019. In 2018, the department recorded six hate crimes. 
The Petaluma Police Department and the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office reported six hate crimes each last year, up from four and zero in 2019, respectively. Rohnert Park and Healdsburg each accounted for one of the 25 hate crimes reported in Sonoma County last year. 
Mahurin, the Santa Rosa police spokesman, said part of the increase his department experienced might have to do with its outreach to communities that have historically been hesitant to report crimes. 
A year-old computer system that the officers use to write police reports, which is part of an information-sharing consortium project involving most Sonoma County's law enforcement agencies, may also be making an impact, Mahurin said. 
The system includes a section in which officers must indicate whether a crime included a hate crime component. If officers mark yes, they then have to identify the type of bias they suspect was at play. 
""We have to make that decision as an agency,"" Mahurin said. ""Usually we err on the side of criminal investigation."" 
News item: An online report about a custody order violation in Santa Rosa last October indicates the crime included anti-Native American and/or Alaska Native bias, though the report contains no information on why. Due to the nature of the report, it is forwarded to the Sonoma County District Attorney's Office to handle as a civil matter, though it is automatically classified as a hate crime by the department, police said. 
A Press Democrat analysis of the hate crimes reported last year to local law enforcement shows discrepancies in how officers classified hate crime reports. 
In Petaluma, for example, a U.S. Postal Service employee saw a toy monkey hung by a rope on a tree in front of a home on June 26, and police were asked to investigate. 
After speaking with the homeowner, police learned that the toy animal was an ode to a spider monkey that was a family pet. He had not realized the monkey he intended as a decoration was interpreted as a racist symbol, the homeowner told The Petaluma Argus Courier.

Asian Woman Shoved Into Moving Vehicle,"Tamanaha, Akemi",Others,2021-09-22,"An Asian woman is speaking out after being shoved into a moving vehicle in New York City's Chinatown, ABC 7 reports. 
Last Monday, September 13, a 28-year-old Asian woman was standing on the corner of Eldridge and Grand Street in Chinatown around 2:40 p.m. 
The woman looked both ways as she prepared to cross the street. A video shows the female suspect standing behind the woman. At the right moment, she shoves the Asian woman into a moving vehicle. 
The victim's only physical injury was a bruised knee, but she told ABC 7 the incident left her traumatized. A few days after she began questioning what had happened to her. 
""I started having self-doubts,"" she told ABC 7. ""I didn't go to work for a couple days. I started thinking too much, like over thinking, replaying the scenario. And I thought to myself, did I see her somewhere before, down the street, did I bump into her? Did I cut her off at the stop light and I just didn't know? All that was getting in my head."" 
The victim isn't sure why she was assaulted, but she does wonder if being an Asian American in Chinatown may have had an influence. 
Attacks on Asian Americans in New York City have persisted throughout the pandemic. In June, a man punched a 55-year-old Asian woman unprovoked on the sidewalk, NBC News reports.

'I feel like it's more blatant': Students afraid amid rise in anti-Asian hate,"Henry, Megan",Others,2021-08-04,"Abby Bogart was called a virus at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. The 13-year-old, who is both Asian American and Black, was deeply hurt by the remark, which she says was made by someone she had considered to be a close friend at the time. ""I remember that day bawling to my mom,"" she said. ""We were just sitting there hugging each other and talking it out. We were just very emotional and it was a very sad night."" 
One in eight Asian Americans reported hate incidents in 2020, according to a national coalition battling the problem. And one in 10 reported anti-Asian hate incidents in the first quarter of 2021, including physical assaults, verbal harassment, civil rights violations and online harassment. 
It's an issue that affects adults and children, according to the latest data from the San Francisco-based nonprofit Stop AAPI Hate. 
Of those who reported hate incidents in 2020, 16% came from Asian Americans ages 12 to 20. And about 80% of them reported being bullied or verbally harassed, often at school, Stop AAPI Hate found. 
Racism against people of Asian descent is an ongoing problem, ""but this pandemic, it has been more active,"" said Bogart, an eighth-grader at Metro Early College Middle School, a public STEM school on the Northwest Side. ""Since the pandemic, I feel like it's more blatant.' 
Hate crimes against Asian-Americans overall reached an ""alarming level"" in the United States, according to an August report by the United Nations. More than 1,800 racist incidents against Asian Americans were reported from March to May. 
The attacks included physical assaults, vandalism, verbal harassment, denial of access to services and public spaces, the report said. Victims also reported being spat on, blocked from public transportation, discriminated against in workplaces, shunned, beaten, stabbed, and insulted as transmitters of the coronavirus. 
In March, a Georgia man went on a shooting spree at three Atlanta spas, killing eight people, including six Asian women, provoking fear in a community already feeling fearful and intimidated in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. 
A month earlier, a 61-year-old Filipino American was slashed across the face with a box cutter and left bleeding inside a New York City subway train as his assailant fled. 
And in late January, an 84-year-old Thai immigrant in San Francisco was violently shoved to the ground and died after what his family called an attack ""driven by hate"" and prosecutors said was horrific and senseless. 
With the rise in hate incidents nationwide and the new school year less than a month away, many Asian American students in central Ohio are bracing for the potential of new or continued verbal assaults by fellow students when they return to school in the fall. 
""I am obviously concerned about possible instances that could occur regarding my race,"" said Lou Cariello, who is Asian American. 
The 17-year-old senior at Bexley High School chose to do her schooling remotely last year because of concerns about contracting COVID-19 and xenophobic comments by classmates about Asians and the origin of the virus. 
""I was scared to even walk around my neighborhood with my dogs because I didn't want anyone to look at me as they were driving by or say something,"" she said. 
About 2% of Bexley school students are Asian American or Pacific Islander, according to the most recent data from the Ohio Department of Education. At Columbus City Schools, the state's largest district, the percentage is nearly 4%. 
Cariello, who was adopted from China when she was a year old, remembers some students asking her racist questions even before the pandemic such as, 'Do you support eating dogs?', 'Why are you eating that weird food?' and 'Are you a communist?' 
""I didn't want to imagine what it was going to be like if I went back to school in-person in the midst of everything going on,"" she said. 
She currently plans to go back to school in person for her senior year and said she has a couple of teachers she feels comfortable confiding in if something were to happen. 
Racist incidents targeting Asian Americans occurred before COVID-19, but the pandemic increased the frequency and level of bullying, said Sharon Kim, a member of Ohio Progressive Asian Women's Leadership, a grassroots community group committed to empowering women of Asian and Pacific Islander descent. 
""Being targeted because of someone's race or ethnicity or whatever difference, these are concerns that us parents have had even before the pandemic,"" she said. ""The sad fact of the matter is the pandemic ... just really increased the bullying that was already present."" 
Even before their son Elliot was born, she and her husband worried about him being harassed and bullied because of his Asian ethnicity. 
""It's not if it's going to happen, it's when it's going to happen,"" Kim said. 
Elliot, now 5, is going to be a first-grader at Ecole Kenwood French Immersion Elementary School in Columbus City Schools. He recently told his mother, she said, how someone pulled back their eyes at him as part of a racist gesture in 2019 when he was in preschool. 
""It's pretty heartbreaking,"" she said. ""It's just a reminder that this kind of racialized experience is already in his life experience as something that's probably going to happen again."" 
The pandemic has ""really shown how the world views Asian Americans and it's been incredibly disheartening,"" said Annie Johnson, a junior at Dublin Coffman High School. 
She said schools should take action against students who make racist remarks. 
""My race, my heritage, my culture is not a joke. It's not your punchline,"" said Johnson who is Asian American and white. ""A lot of these jokes, I don't get what's funny about it."" 
About 21% of Dublin school students are Asian American or Pacific Islander, according Ohio Department of Education data. 
Hearing xenophobic comments takes a toll on the 15-year-old. 
""It's so frustrating just because you know you are hearing this and it's not true but at the same time, you know there's nothing you can do about it,"" Johnson said. 
Another way schools can help Asian American and other minority students is by hiring employees whose job is to focus on inclusion and equality for all students in every school building, said Gloria Chan, a 17-year-old senior at Thomas Worthington High School. 
Nearly 5% of Worthington school students are Asian American or Pacific Islander like Chan, according to the latest state education data. 
""I think it really starts with the teachers, because if the students are allowed to get by with that in the classroom, then they are going to do it outside of the classroom and at home, and it's just going to get worse,"" Chan said. ",6736
Asian unity urged in fighting hatred in US,"Zhu, Lia",Others,2021-08-12,"Forum hears troubling accounts as 'fertile ground' for racism yet to be eradicated 
Asian consuls general in San Francisco joined California elected officials at a virtual forum to show solidarity with Asian-American communities, calling on those of Asian descent to stand up against racism. 
The consuls general from eight Asian countries, including China, Japan, South Korea, India and Vietnam, expressed concerns about the rising racism and hate crimes against Asians in the United States and urged the federal and state governments to take concrete measures to address the problem. 
""Throughout the American history, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have made an indelible contribution to the development of the United States. They deserve due recognition and respect and not hate or discrimination,"" said Chinese Consul General in San Francisco Wang Donghua at the forum hosted by Asia Society Northern California on Monday. 
The root cause for the anti-Asian hate is the racial discrimination against people of color in the US, and the ""fertile ground"" for discrimination and prejudice against Asians is yet to be eradicated, said Wang. The scapegoating of Chinese people for the COVID-19 pandemic by some politicians has exacerbated the hate against Asians, he added. 
He said it was encouraging that US President Joe Biden signed into law a bill that is aimed at countering the rising anti-Asian hate crimes. 
""As a member of the Asian consular community, we appreciate the solidarity that California officials have demonstrated against Asian hate. We urge the US federal government and those states who haven't done so to take actions to stop Asian hate, bring perpetrators to justice, ensure the security of all Asians and address the root cause by eradicating the soil for discrimination against Asians and other ethnic groups in the US,"" said Wang. 
Long-existing problem 
California state Senator Dave Min and Assembly member Phil Ting, both of Asian descent, said anti-Asian racism is a long-existing problem in the US and shared their own stories of growing up in California. 
California is a state that tends to be more diverse and more receptive to Asian Americans than other parts of the country, but Ting said his upbringing always made him 
feel like an outsider. 
""I was always feeling that I was a minority, my parents were immigrants, so I never quite fit in,"" said Ting. He said he didn't understand how to articulate that outsider feeling until he took Asian-American studies at high school. 
""This is something that was much larger than one individual spewing hate at me as I was growing up. This was something that was part of our societal fabric, that there were laws on the books that created this otherness, that there were structures in place to make sure that there were systemic racist policies that were put forward,"" said Ting, who sees the teaching of Asian-American history and ethnic studies as a solution. 
""The history of anti-Asian hate and racism is pretty well established in this country. But for those of us who've lived here and grew up here, while we've been accustomed to anti-Asian hate, I think we've been surprised by the depth and breadth and intensity of the anti-Asian hate that has arisen during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Min. 
""These types of incidents, even if they're not violent, can be deeply unsettling and frightening to those of Asian descent,"" he said. 
According to Stop AAPI Hate, from March 2020 to March 2021, the self-reporting platform received 6,603 reports of hate incidents nationwide, and 2,640 of these 
incidents were from California. 
""If you're not at the table, you're on the menu. I think that's been the case with Asian Americans for too long,"" said Min. ""Without our robust Asian American presence, which we still need to grow, we would not have gotten that kind of attention,"" he said.",3876
SF Man Faces Hate Crime Charges for Vandalism of 20 Chinese-owned Businesses,"Tamanaha, Akemi",Others,2021-08-18,"A man is facing 33 charges, including hate crime allegations, for vandalizing 27 businesses, KPIX reports. Twenty of those businesses were primarily Chinese-owned. 
San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin announced the charges Monday. The suspect, Derik Barreto, is accused of using a slingshot, pipe, or hammer to break the window of primarily Chinese-owned businesses, KHRON 4 reports. 
The DA's office charged Barreto with 27 felony counts of vandalism, four felony counts of second-degree burglary, one misdemeanor count of possession of burglary tools and one misdemeanor count of possession of a concealed weapon. 
In June, a string of vandalism cases occurred in San Francisco's Chinatown. Businesses have struggled to remain open because of the cost of repairing the damages. Chinatown business owners believed the vandalism was racially motivated. 
""We absolutely do not tolerate violence or hate in San Francisco. Chinese-owned businesses should be able to operate without fear of being racially targeted by vandalism, burglary, or harassment,"" Boudin said in the release, according to KPIX. ""We stand with San Francisco's AAPI community against hate and will do everything in our power to make sure everyone is and feels safe."" ",1244

'I was devastated': Woman shares story of racist incident in Richmond Hill Dollarama,None,Others,2021-08-26,"For the whole day after she heard the racist word thrown at her, she couldn't stop shaking. 
Now she can barely speak about the episode without breaking down in tears. 
While visiting Richmond Hill from her home in Washington, D.C. in mid-August, Caroline Leung said she was called a racist epithet and told to ""go back to China"" by two women she'd kindly asked to move away from her in a local Dollarama. 
""I felt attacked, unprotected and violated,"" said the 41-year-old PhD student at the University of Maryland. ""I was devastated."" 
Now, she's going public with the incident to educate Canadians about how racist behaviour, often associated to the United States, is also alive and well in her native land. 
--- 
""In the United States, I hear people telling me to go back to China quite often Canadians think this is an American problem but it's not at all,"" said Leung. ""All the stuff we see on the surface (of Canadian culture) that moment made it feel like, 'Is this all just a cover'? The negative sentiment is there against Asians. You can ask any BIPOC person and they will tell you this is not a lone incident."" 
Leung, a mother of one who was born in Canada, said she was one of the first people at the Canada/U.S. border when COVID-19 restrictions were lifted and she could finally to come visit her family north of the border. 
The trip was going well until she decided to swing by the Dollarama at Major Mackenzie Drive and Bayview Avenue to buy some souvenirs to help her young son remember the trip. 
While in line at the store, there were two women who repeatedly bumped into her, she said. 
""I said 'do you mind if you stay on the sticker, I would be more comfortable',"" she said. 
In reply the women called her the slur and followed that up with calls to ""go back to China."" 
""The other woman said 'she's wearing one of those cheap Chinese masks',"" Leung added. ""The only way I felt I could protect myself was to bring out my camera and start filming."" 
Leung said her actions resulted in other customers suggesting she was wrong to film others, until she explained what the women had said to her. 
When she arrived at the counter, the cashier who Leung felt did not want to get involved, said it might be best to exit immediately. 
""She said 'I think it's best if you leave the store',"" she explained. ""I went in my car and I was shaking, I felt very attacked. This is the neighbourhood I grew up in. My father used to live down the street. To have this happen in a place I call home was horrible ... Canada is my safe place"" 
Leung then explained how she felt re-victimized when she noticed the women were being served by the same cashier. 
Dollarama staff were dismissive when approached with her concerns both in person and over email, she added. 
In reply to allegations that staff should be better trained and they didn't treat the incident with the gravity Leung expected, Dollarama said staff are specifically trained to avoid heated interactions. 
""Dollarama aims to promote a safe, discrimination-free and inclusive store environment for both customers and employees,"" said Annie Bedard, a spokesperson for the 
company. 
""Also note that our store employees, as policy, are also instructed to not engage in any argument, altercation or confrontation between other parties, to ensure their safety at all times."" 
Phyllis Naccarato, Leung's mother, said she hopes the interaction teaches people this type of behaviour is not acceptable, especially in a nation where so many people are children of immigrants or immigrants themselves. 
""It brings sadness, I get teary just talking about it,"" she said. ""It's particularly disappointing when it's your own child.""

Racist spews anti-Asian slurs on subway. Safety concerns grow,Randall,Others,2021-08-23,"Yet another racist incident on a New York subway train. 
According to influencer Jackfroot, an Asian American woman said she had boarded a train and had barely sat down, when another woman began verbally assaulting her. 
A video posted on Instagram Sunday shows that passenger calling the Asian American woman a ch*nk and warning ""Don't f*ck with me. Ch*nk."" 
Just this past March, a woman hit an Asian passenger across the face without provocation and then began yelling racial slurs. 
The following month, a man spit on an Asian woman and her three children. 
Then a drunk man tried to push an Asian woman onto the subway tracks in Brooklyn before being stopped. 
All three of those incidents happened in the New York Subway system. 
Recently, Mayor Bill De Blasio pledged to focus subway patrols on bias crimes, according to the New York Times. 
Crisanna Tang told the Times said that in July a maskless man spit on her and told her to go back to China. 
She says she now pays to take the more expensive express bus rather than to ride on a subway and risk her own safety. 
""I just wish these incidents would stop,"" Tang said. ""I am worried about the elderly community. I am really worried not enough is being done for them."" 
This past April, protesters took the subway system to loudly express their concern and to distribute safety messages to passengers recently. 
""We are outraged that Asian Americans are being attacked both above and below ground. And to make matters worse, bystanders are watching us get attacked with complete indifference. This is absolutely unacceptable! Asian American are human beings, and we should be treated as such. That is why we are protesting and why we are giving our fellow New Yorkers the push- and the tools they need to become better upstanders for everyone in our city,"" Barbara Yau, who co- founded the group Concerned Asian American Citizens of New York City with Shirley L. Ng. and Judy Ng last year.

Biden wins kudos on racism stand,"Zhu, Lia",Others,2021-01-28,"Order shielding Asian Americans from hatred gets activists' support
US President Joe Biden on Tuesday signed an executive order to address the rising racism against Asian
Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. The move has been welcomed by advocacy groups as ""a promising
step"".
The executive order, one of four addressing racial equity, directs the Department of Health and Human Services
and the COVID-19 health equity task force to issue guidance on cultural competency, language access and
sensitivity.
It also directs the Department of Justice to engage with the Asian American and Pacific Islander, or AAPI,
community on issues related to hate crimes, hate incidents and harassment.
""The federal government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments
through the actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic
location of its origin,"" reads the executive order.
""Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific
Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI
persons.""
The executive order ""sends a powerful message to the AAPI community that the Biden administration is
committed to addressing racial injustice"", said Cynthia Choi, co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative
Action. ""Specifically, the executive order disavowing discrimination against the AAPI community is a promising
step in recognizing the harm done to the AAPI community.""
Wave of attacks
Since the start of the pandemic, Asian Americans have experienced a wave of racist attacks and harassment.
More than 2,800 people reported incidents of racism and discrimination targeting Asian Americans across the USbetween March 19 and Dec 31, 2020, according to Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition aimed at addressing pandemic-
related racism.Former president Donald Trump and his Republican allies are accused of purposely calling COVID-19 the ""China
virus"" in an effort to blame China for the pandemic.
According to Stop AAPI's research, there have been at least 46 racial attacks in which Trump was actively
invoked, and Trump is ""the greatest spreader"" among politicians of anti-Asian-American rhetoric related to the
pandemic.
The research also found his racist or stigmatizing tweets have by far the greatest reach and were retweeted
over 1.2 million times in the first eight months of last year.
""Calling the coronavirus 'China virus' is racist, hurtful, fake information, unscientific, and without basis. Yet it
inflamed racist attacks and harassment against Chinese Americans throughout the US,"" said Lillian Sing, a
retired judge in San Francisco.
Her grandson Logan was a victim. The 18-year-old high school senior was born and raised in Pennsylvania and
had never experienced discrimination until recently in a soccer game, said Sing. The incident happened when he
was in the restroom, where one player said to the other players: ""Let's get out ... a Chinese who spreads
coronavirus.""
Logan's story isn't an isolated one. A study by the Stop AAPI Hate Youth Campaign found one in four young
Asian Americans have experienced a form of anti-Asian hatred.
""Asian Americans are suffering from more racial attacks and harassments than ever before. In scientific,
business, political, academic and government circles,"" said Sing.
According to the White House, Biden plans to retain Christopher Wray as FBI director and has confidence in the
job Wray is doing.
Sing said: ""His (Wray's) characterization of China as posing a 'whole of society' threat to the US implies that all
individuals of Chinese descent are to be distrusted.
""Hopefully, Christopher Wray will also abide by President Biden's executive order to demonstrate cultural
competency, language access, and sensitivity toward AAPI.""

"Asian worries rise even higher: Two more incidents, including one that ended in a young father's death, come as attacks rise nationally.","Shaw, Julie",Others,2021-06-10,"Philadelphia's Asian community has been on edge over the last few weeks after two recent attacks 
one that left a Chinese American takeout restaurant owner dead, 
and the other in which a high school student was randomly punched while walking with his grandmother. 
In May, Wei Lin, 28, the takeout owner, went to help a delivery driver who didn't speak English after the driver got into a minor car accident. As they were waiting for police to arrive, a woman in the other vehicle called others to the scene, and authorities say a man punched Lin in the head, knocking him unconscious. Lin, a father of two young daughters, died three days later. 
A suspect, Jose Figueroa, 30, of Hunting Park, was arrested and charged with involuntary manslaughter. 
And last week, a 17-year-old Chinese American student was randomly punched by two teens in Mayfair. A female friend of the attackers then started laughing, the victim and his grandmother said. 
Mingchu Pearl Huynh, president of the Northeast Philadelphia Chinese Association and a friend of the boy's grandmother, said she's afraid to walk in the city. ""It can happen to any one of us,"" she said. ""... We are all scared."" 
In both cases, community advocates say they believe the victims were targeted because they are of Asian descent. No racist words were said by the attackers, and authorities haven't raised the prospect of ethnic intimidation charges in either case. But the attacks come at a time of rising violence against people of Asian descent. 
During a news briefing Wednesday on violence in the city, Mayor Jim Kenney said: ""We recognize the trauma and fear inflicted on our Asian American and Pacific Islander community during these uncertain times. So let me be perfectly clear: There is no place for hate or violence in our city against our AAPI brothers and sisters or anyone else. Our administration takes these unspeakable acts very seriously. We are working with the police and leaders from the AAPI community to address concerns and create safer streets for all."" 
According to Stop AAPI Hate, which has been tracking incidents of hate, violence, and harassment against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States, there have been more than 6,600 cases reported to the group from March of last year through March of this year. Stop AAPI Hate began tracking such incidents last year in response to what it called ""the alarming escalation in xenophobia and bigotry resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic."" 
Huynh, asked why she thinks people of Asian descent may be targeted, said: ""I think in people's mind, Asians are weak."" 
John Chin, executive director of the Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation, agreed. He said the assault on the 17-year-old boy is more clearly a racial incident. ""The attackers could have attacked anyone on the street, but for some reason they sought out this particular family on the street and attacked them,"" he said. 
As for the punching of the takeout owner, Chin said the assailant might have ""felt the bravado to physically intimidate him"" because of stereotypes of Asian Americans, including that they are weak or might not report incidents to police. 
Elijah Anderson, a Yale University sociology professor, who studies urban communities like Philadelphia, said he disagreed that Asians are targeted because they are perceived as weak. 
""It's complicated,"" he said. Attacks on any group of people can come from another group who feel their ""race is better than other people"" or who ""feel their own group is under threat,"" he said. 
Lin's wife, who asked not to be identified by name because she feared for her safety, said Monday that she thinks her husband was punched because of his Asian face. ""They think Asian people is weak,"" she said at her husband's Kensington takeout, which closed after the attack. 
She showed pictures and videos of her husband playing with their daughters, now 19 months and 3 months old. Her husband, who immigrated to this country from China's Fujian province then became an American citizen, often helped people, she said. 
Police last week arrested Figueroa, of the 4000 block of North Sixth Street, in the fatal attack on Lin. He posted bail and has been released as he awaits a preliminary hearing. 
His attorney, Geoffrey Seay, said Figueroa was called to the accident scene at L and Luzerne Streets by his mother or another woman who was in the other vehicle. He declined to comment on the case except to say, ""This isn't a hate crime."" 
The takeout's delivery driver, speaking in Mandarin Chinese on Wednesday, said through an interpreter that he, too, was injured. He said that after Lin was punched, the assailant and two other men in the other group pushed him to the ground. He said he was hit in the back, arm, chest, and eye. 
On Monday, Huynh walked with Yue Xian Wu, the grandmother of the 17-year-old boy who was punched, to the scene of the teen's attack. Wu, speaking in Mandarin Chinese, described how she and her grandson were walking about 7 p.m. Friday on Hawthorne Street near Friendship, next to Mayfair Elementary School, when two teens, about 17 or 18 years old, ran toward her grandson and punched him in the face, ear, and back. 
A girl around the same age came over and started laughing, then left with the two assailants, Wu said. 
""She feel like they treat us like a toy, like an entertainment and hit us for fun, for a game,"" Huynh said of Wu, interpreting for her. ""She feel like Asians don't report to the police and don't speak English,"" making them an ""easy target."" 
Wu's grandson, Yuheng Chen, suffered a bloody nose, bruises on his right ear, temporary dizziness, and various cuts. But he didn't seek medical treatment. Speaking at the home he shares with his grandmother, he brushed off the incident, saying he didn't want to bother people. Although he initially reported the attack, he expressed reluctance about following up with police about it. ""I don't want other people to feel I'm sad,"" he said. 
""This is not normal,"" Huynh told Chen. ""This is not right. That's why I'm fighting. ... If we don't stand up for ourselves, the police cannot help. They can only do so much.... You'll only be a victim if you continue to be like, 'Oh, they hit me, that's OK.' If anyone hit me like that, I will yell. I will make the whole town know about it and I'd say, 'Stop it.",6368
Inside the California organization tracking anti-Asian hate incidents,"Seshadri, Mallika",Others,2021-06-17,"Richard Lim was walking along a quiet sidewalk near UC Berkeley's fraternity row last summer when, he said, two men called out to him. 
""Hey Coronavirus, why don't you take yourself and go home,"" they shouted at the Asian American Studies graduate student, who was wearing a mask. ""You don't want to contaminate anyone."" 
Even within his own family, the racist harassment Lim faced was not unique. His aunt, who works at an Asian supermarket, had also experienced racist verbal attacks, making her and Lim just two of thousands of Asian Americans who have reported experiencing harassment during the COVID- 19 pandemic. 
Later that summer, with incidents on the rise, Lim decided to do something. He became a volunteer with Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition based in California that has recorded nearly 7,000 hate incidents involving Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders nationwide since the beginning of the pandemic and created reports based on their findings. Despite being a small volunteer organization, the group has in just over a year become a leading source for tracking incidents of hate in the country, and its work has been cited by dozens of media outlets including The Examiner, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, KQED, MSNBC and NBC News. 
""Collecting the data and reporting on the data and getting in front of the media and other folks was really important,"" state Sen. Richard Pan, a Sacramento Democreat who chairs the California Legislature's Asian Pacific Islander Caucus, said of the coalition's work. ""Without that collaboration, without that effort, I'm sure we would have individual stories, but they would not have highlighted this challenge that we're seeing."" 
Volunteers like Lim say Stop AAPI Hate's impact has extended beyond publishing reports. 
""We've grown to be more than just a data collection center,"" Lim said. ""We've become a foundation for grounding a movement."" 
More than 2,800 reports were submitted to Stop AAPI Hate during 
March alone. 
Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University, co-founded Stop AAPI Hate in March 2020 along with colleagues at two Asian-American advocacy organizations, Chinese for Affirmative Action's Cynthia Choi and the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council's Manjusha Kulkarni. 
""I knew from Asian American history that when epidemics came from Asia, Asians would be blamed and then face racism,"" said Jeung. ""I quickly started documenting the racism."" 
The center soon received a number of grants from foundations, including one from professional basketball player Jeremy Lin, and gathered a group of volunteers and student researchers who could aid their mission. 
Nearly a year later, the state of California pitched in, setting aside $1.4 million for the Stop AAPI Hate Coalition and UCLA's Asian American Studies Center to conduct research on hate crimes against Asian Americans. The funding was championed by the Asian Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus. 
While the FBI, the Department of Justice and California's Attorney General's Office collect data on hate crimes in California, no government agency was systematically tracking the recent uptick in harassment of Asian Americans, Pan said. 
Volunteers review each report submitted by community members to the Stop AAPI Hate website; more than 2,800 came in during March 2021 alone. Women reported more than two thirds of all incidents in the coalition's most recent national report. About 44% involved Chinese Americans. 
While about 12% of survivors said they experienced some form of physical assault, more than two-thirds reported verbal harassment. Others reported civil rights violations, such as workplace discrimination or online attacks. 
""When someone calls you a racial slur from a moving car, that's not something that you can necessarily call the police about. That's not violent. You are not physically hurt,"" said Chinese for Affirmative Action spokesperson Yamuna Hopwood. 
""But it's hateful all the same."" 
Once received by the coalition, reports are entered into a database. If necessary, the report is then translated into English. Stop AAPI Hate does not verify the reports, Jeung said, but volunteers do ""clean up"" the data. 
Along with editing reports for spelling and grammar, they interpret certain aspects of a case, such as determining what type of hate incident took place, said Eric Augustus Bai, a data engineer who helped Stop AAPI Hate develop new ways to visualize their data. 
Aggregated data sets allow tracking of trends within anti-Asian racism, Jeung said. He stressed the importance of depicting racism as ""widespread, institutionalized and systemic."" Recent reports from the coalition have analyzed the impact of racism on different Asian American ethnicities, on women and girls and on mental health. 
Brian Levin, who directs the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, said Stop AAPI Hate's findings line up with his own research, which focuses on crimes reported to police. Using police data, the center found that hate crimes against Asians in the U.S. increased by almost 200% between the first quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 - a sign, Levin said, that the trend has not yet peaked. 
Some community members have contacted Stop AAPI Hate in the wake of an incident as an alternative to calling the police, organizers say. The coalition does not have the capacity to directly respond to incidents of harassment, but plans to create online resources to help survivors, including multilingual videos that address actions people can take if bullied, ways to talk to a child dealing with trauma and how to talk to family about race. 
Volunteers also work on other projects aimed at changing common narratives about Asian Americans. 
""If part of the issue is that Asians are being represented or seen as perpetual foreigners and treated as foreigners to be objectified and attacked, then we have to change that narrative,"" Jeung said. ""And narrative work involves education."" 
This past school year, more than 20 high school interns helped the coalition create social media campaigns and a series of workshops covering intersectionality, the yellow peril stereotype, Japanese American incarceration and mental health. 
Rebecca Wu, a junior at Alhambra High School, spent part of the year developing the workshops, which will be posted on the center's website for use in high school classrooms and student club meetings. 
""I was looking at the worksheets we made, the slides and the outline of the lesson...I was just so amazed,"" Wu said. ""That was kind of when I felt like, well, like we could be taken seriously."" 
Stop AAPI Hate has also been working with Asian American students to learn about their concerns and ideas for increased safety on school campuses. Student leaders drafted a letter with their suggestions - which range from expanding mental health services to creating a multilingual, online hub for students to anonymously report hate incidents - and State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond sent it to district superintendents and charter school administrators on Thursday. 
""It's really hard,"" Hopwood said. ""Acknowledging pain and suffering that victims feel, that we feel vicariously through them, (is) an important step to realize that this is not OK."" 
Jeung said he often spends his day being ""pulled from all sides,"" tending to media requests, working with corporations interested in donating to Stop AAPI Hate and attending listening sessions run by the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services and the White 
House. 
Each day, he said, he goes through ""the range of emotions, from anger to depression to hope."" 
""We're still grieving over the Atlanta shootings. We're still angered by seeing our elderly pushed and shoved,"" Jeung said. ""That's, for me, a real heavy burden to support the community at the moment."" 
Others, like San Francisco State University graduate student Boaz Tang, who has been reviewing incident reports for the past year, say they are using their anger to fuel their volunteer work, instead of just stewing. 
""I'm going to try to do what I can with the opportunities that I have, just so I don't have to sit on my rage and feel numb,"" Tang said. 
Although Stop AAPI Hate seeks to uplift Asian American communities during a time of need, the coalition has faced criticism for its name. And some activists say they worry that the focus on anti-Asian hate incidents is getting co-opted in a way that will lead to more police presence and targeting of Black people within Asian American communities. 
Jacob Lacuesta, an Asian American Studies graduate student at San Francisco State, said he supports the coalition's efforts but that the name Stop AAPI Hate homogenizes the Asian American community and is a ""complete erasure"" of different Asian identities, leaving out South Asians and Middle Eastern people, among others. 
Jeung said naming the organization was not the coalition's top priority. ""We didn't spend a lot of time thinking about or trying to brand ourselves,"" he said. ""We're just trying to address the racism."" 
And though racism against Asian Americans predates the pandemic, Hopwood said the events of the past two years provided an opportunity to 
create new solutions. 
""This did not start when the pandemic did, and it won't end when the pandemic ends,"" she said. ""It's all about taking the energy and a lot of the attention that this issue has gathered in this moment and trying to channel it into long-term, meaningful change.""

New Study Finds Most Perpetrators of Anti-Asian Hate Crimes Are White,"Tamanaha, Akemi",Others,2021-06-16,"New analysis of anti-Asian hate crime statistics reveals a majority of perpetrators are White, NBC News reports. 
Janelle Wong, a professor of American Studies at the University of Maryland, College Park examined nine sources and four different data states relating 
to anti-Asian hate crimes. She looked at data from Stop AAPI Hate, Pew Research and official law enforcement statistics. 
Wong's analysis revealed that more than three-quarters of perpetrators of anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents, before and during the pandemic, were White. 
Unfortunately, news reports and social media often encourage the idea that most anti-Asian violence and discrimination is committed by people of color, NBC News reports. 
""This is really how crime is framed in the United States - it's framed as the source is Black,"" Wong told NBC News. 
Wong says a misreading of a study from the American Journal of Criminal Justice, which examined anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents from 1994-2014, may have also contributed to misplaced blame. The study found that compared to anti-Black and anti-Latino hate crimes, a higher proportion of perpetrators of anti-Asian hate crimes were people of color. 
Ultimately, however, the study found that more than three-quarters of the perpetrators were White. 
The misconceptions perpetuate harmful racial stereotypes, specifically anti-Blackness, NBC News reports. Yet, Wong pointed out that despite the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, Black people are the most targeted racial group. 
Wong added that the misconceptions can also hurt opportunities for racial solidarity. Most anti-Asian attackers are not people of color, however, research suggests that most people of color are concerned about the rise in anti-Asian hate. 
A poll conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 85 percent of Black Americans and 82 percent of Hispanic Americans were at least somewhat concerned about the violence against Asians had increased during the pandemic. Only 74 percent of White Americans were at least somewhat concerned. 
Within those groups, 50 percent of Black Americans, 47 percent of Hispanic Americans and 41 percent of White Americans were extremely concerned.

Attacks on Asian Americans are abhorrent,None,Others,2021-06-13,"It's a matter of human nature, I suppose, to choose to place blame on someone or something for an agonizing, catastrophic event. We may not always have all the correct information, and we may not even be accurate as to what was behind it, but I guess that really doesn't matter, as long as someone pays. 
All right, so you're angry, join the club! I totally believe 100% of all Americans are angry regarding how the pandemic affected them for one reason or another. You have been sick, your family and friends have been sick, you were laid off, your business went under, or regrettably someone you loved died. All good reasons to be angry. 
So who pays for your pain? Our nation is kind of at that point right now, where many people have picked out someone to vilify for COVID-19. And believe me, there are many targets to choose from. Of course, there's Donald Trump, who was president when the pandemic began. Then we can add former Vice President Mike Pence, who was Trump's pandemic point man. I'm quite sure most Americans have had enough of Dr. Fauci, who can't help changing his mind on a daily basis. Of course, President Biden's mask mandate was frustrating, and his COVID-19 relief package price was so astronomical, it may have actually crippled the restart of America's recovery. 
Needless to say, the daily updates and recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were more confusing than Dr. Fauci's daily diatribe. And if you're a Minnesotan, Gov. Walz's lockdown, mandates and restart program would have more than tested the patience of Job. 
Or maybe we can blame the Chinese. After all, isn't China where the virus came from? But what if we don't know which Asian people we come in contact with are actually Chinese? After all, don't all Asian people look alike? Shouldn't all of them be punished for this indiscriminate virus? 
Regrettably, that's exactly what's happening across the world and in our own backyards. Asian people have become targets of opportunity for many angry people in America. NBC News reported 3,800 hate incidents between March 19, 2020, and Feb. 28, 2021. That number is up from 2,600 incidents reported in that time period a 
year ago. 
An Asian American Pacific Islander advocacy organization reported 68% of the assaults happened to women, while 29% of victims were men, and 3% listed themselves as transgender or nonbinary. 
These attacks include being spat upon, verbally abused, pushed, shoved, punched, or thrown to the ground, or refusing to give them service in a store. However, some people have taken it to a sadistic level. The BBC reports a Chinese woman was slapped in the face before being set on fire. An elderly Thai man was killed when he was violently thrown to the ground. 
Sorrily this is not the first time Asian people have been singled out for oppression and violence in the United States. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the government systematically rounded up people of Japanese descent, placing 120,000 of them in confinement camps for nearly four years, fearing they would attack America from within. 
What everyone needs to realize is that every Asian American in our country has also suffered through the ravages of COVID-19 just as we all have. If anyone can actually attempt to justify these abhorrent attacks, you truly need to look into your soul and figure out who you really are.

Asian healthcare workers in the COVID-19 pandemic: a long road to recovery,Jo-Hsuan Wu,Others,2021-06-28,"Almost one and a half years ago,
the first case of COVID-19 was
confirmed in Wuhan, China,
followed by a state of global health
emergency due to a worldwide pandemic.
Effective vaccines against COVID-19 were
finally released, and over 40% of the US
population has now been fully vaccinated.
The battle of the United States versus
COVID-19 seems to have reached the
mitigation phase. However, for many living
in this country, the detrimental effects of
this virus may still be ongoing.
Long before the pandemic, the Asian
population in the United States had
been viewed and treated as the physical
embodiment of foreignness and disease, and
this stigma does not disappear because you
are a medical worker wearing a white coat.
As the stress levels of society elevated with
the outbreak of a China-originated virus, the
increase in negative bias against the Asian
population was perhaps not surprising.
When I first moved to the United States
to advance my career, it was right at the peak
of the pandemic. News of racist assaults
and ignorant attacks against Asians were
broadcast, and I can recall some headlines
saying ‘the assaults are spreading faster than
the coronavirus’. Although I live in one of
the most Asian-friendly states, in California,
it was not easy to reassure myself and others
about my personal safety.
While many can practice social isolation
by working from home, most healthcare
workers are still meeting people of all
ethnic backgrounds and personal values.
Born and raised in a country with limited
understanding about racial discrimination,
I was prepared for possible hostility from
people of different skin colors. “To some,everyone with yellow skin either has COVID-
19, or should be partially responsible for theimpact of COVID-19 in this country,” said
one of my Asian American friends. Were
Asian healthcare workers treated aggressively
by racist patients? Yes. Were they teased
disrespectfully on subjects about COVID-19?Of course. However, because of our jobs as
healthcare workers, we are used to ignoring
such comments and suppressing our feelings
when we encounter discrimination.
I later realized that racism does not
come only from patients. Occasionally,
discrimination against Asians, including
microaggressions, can be observed within the
medical community. These microaggressions
may be an anonymous comment in an
online physician forum, a careless statement
recorded in an academic interview, an
ignorant joke told by some hospital workers
passing by, or even an unconscious act of a
colleague. Physical attacks are not common
in our work environments, but emotional and
verbal aggressions can be seen in all forms
and from all sources. Are these comments
repeated when people leave work and interact
with others in non-medical professions? We
cannot know. Nevertheless, with the public
influence of healthcare workers, due to their
professional roles, even the least intended
discriminative language may worsen the
overall effect on society. Sometimes I would
tell myself, “You may need to fight not
only the coronavirus, but also the racism
in your working environment.” In the time
of COVID-19, this fear of Asian healthcare
workers can be easily learned.
It is undeniable that Asian healthcare
workers have suffered from an aggravated
negative bias because of the COVID-19
pandemic. However, I have also learned
to appreciate the opposite side of this; the
pursuit of diversity and equality is also a
shared goal for many in this country. Owing
to my cultural background, in the past I
was unaware that not being discriminated
against on the basis of your skin color is
essential for good mental health. Now I am
grateful that I work in a department that has
long focused on diversity and equality issues.
I have also witnessed many non-Asian
medical workers using their voices to help
eliminate anti-Asian sentiments. Seeing the
efforts of colleagues and strangers, I feel
encouraged to speak up for other Asianhealthcare workers who may or may not
be lucky enough to feel safe, secure and
respected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
With the rapid distribution of vaccines
in the United States, it is estimated that
normality may resume imminently. Beyond
the control of COVID-19, it is unclear what
other aspects of normality should be expected.
The balance between public health and
infection? The resumption of social activities?
Or the recovery of a thriving economy?
In addition to the number of infections
and hospitalizations, the complications of
aggravated racism in certain populations
must be considered. Recovery from the social
and psychological aspects of the COVID-19
pandemic will take longer than recovery from
the disease. This will require medical workers
to attend to the racism-related experiences
and mental health needs of not only their
patients but also their co-workers.
COVID-19 swept through and shook
the United States on multiple levels.
The pandemic revealed not only the
weakness of the human immune system
and the US healthcare system but also
the underestimated extent of racial
discrimination in society and within the
medical community. COVID-19 has taught a
lesson that we are grateful for, but also fearful
of. For many Asian healthcare workers, the
negative experience we have gone through
may not be cured or healed easily. The road
to recovery is long, and for everyone working
in the medical field, this is one important
goal we should fight together for.

Salutatorian condemns anti-Asian racism. Gets some boos,Randall,Others,2021-06-21,"An Asian American high school graduate who used her Salutatorian speech to condemn anti-Asian hate and oppression of all people of color is being subjected to racist cyber-bullying by those who accused her of being anti-Semitic. 
Al Dia News reports Rachel Cheng has been harassed on both Facebook and Instagram and has been called out for not condemning the Chinese government for its treatment of Muslims in Uyghur. 
The crowd at the graduation at Western High School in Broward County, Florida sat mostly silent during the four minute speech. 
""Yeah, '21 is our graduation year. But 21 is the number of times I was called ch*nk in a one year time frame our school went online from COVID-19. That kind of ugliness was coming from everywhere and everyone,"" said Cheng. 
""I was chased out of the store because they didn't want ""China virus people in the store...coming to fear not for not only my life, but the lives of my parents and peers just on a single trip to the grocery store became our reality."" 
She says her sentiments are shared by all those who have faced racism-African Americans, Native Americans, Pacific Islander, Hispanic 
and Latinos. 
That's where some in the audience began to turn on her. 
""To my Middle Eastern peers, who have been facing struggle after struggle and have been in constant fear of their families and friends being struck down by a militant government who have had their land stolen and abused, I applaud you."" 
A smattering of boos broke out. Yet she continued to wrap up her speech, not missing a beat. She went on to condemn anti- Semitism. Who walked away from the podium after wrapping up her speech to a round of applause.

Man Faces Hate Crime Charges for Threatening Asian Postal Worker,"Tamanaha, Akemi",Others,2021-06-09,"Authorities have charged a 26-year-old man with a hate crime for allegedly threatening Asian American postal worker who was delivering mail in Daly City, California, KTVU reports. 
The San Mateo County District Attorney's Office said Tuesday that officials had charged Lamont Demetrius West Verdon, of Oakland, with making criminal threats with a hate crime enhancement. 
Verdon allegedly threatened an Asian postal worker standing outside his United States Postal Service truck on June 5, CBS San Francisco reports. 
""F-k you, I'm going to kill you, you f-king Asian,"" prosecutors say Verdon shouted before rummaging through the postal worker's mail bag. 
The victim ran back to his mail truck, locked himself inside and called 911. Police arrested the suspect nearby. 
Verdon is being held at Maguire Correctional Facility in Redwood City on $1,000 bail, CBS San Francisco reports. He will be represented by a public defender. 
On Monday, Verdon plead not guilty to all charges at a preliminary hearing. His next court appearance is June 17.

"Asian worries rise even higher: Two more incidents, including one that ended in a young father's death, come as attacks rise nationally.","Shaw, Julie",Others,2021-06-10,"Philadelphia's Asian community has been on edge over the last few weeks after two recent attacks 
one that left a Chinese American takeout restaurant owner dead, 
and the other in which a high school student was randomly punched while walking with his grandmother. 
In May, Wei Lin, 28, the takeout owner, went to help a delivery driver who didn't speak English after the driver got into a minor car accident. As they were waiting for police to arrive, a woman in the other vehicle called others to the scene, and authorities say a man punched Lin in the head, knocking him unconscious. Lin, a father of two young daughters, died three days later. 
A suspect, Jose Figueroa, 30, of Hunting Park, was arrested and charged with involuntary manslaughter. 
And last week, a 17-year-old Chinese American student was randomly punched by two teens in Mayfair. A female friend of the attackers then started laughing, the victim and his grandmother said. 
Mingchu Pearl Huynh, president of the Northeast Philadelphia Chinese Association and a friend of the boy's grandmother, said she's afraid to walk in the city. ""It can happen to any one of us,"" she said. ""... We are all scared."" 
In both cases, community advocates say they believe the victims were targeted because they are of Asian descent. No racist words were said by the attackers, and authorities haven't raised the prospect of ethnic intimidation charges in either case. But the attacks come at a time of rising violence against people of Asian descent. 
During a news briefing Wednesday on violence in the city, Mayor Jim Kenney said: ""We recognize the trauma and fear inflicted on our Asian American and Pacific Islander community during these uncertain times. So let me be perfectly clear: There is no place for hate or violence in our city against our AAPI brothers and sisters or anyone else. Our administration takes these unspeakable acts very seriously. We are working with the police and leaders from the AAPI community to address concerns and create safer streets for all."" 
According to Stop AAPI Hate, which has been tracking incidents of hate, violence, and harassment against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States, there have been more than 6,600 cases reported to the group from March of last year through March of this year. Stop AAPI Hate began tracking such incidents last year in response to what it called ""the alarming escalation in xenophobia and bigotry resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic."" 
Huynh, asked why she thinks people of Asian descent may be targeted, said: ""I think in people's mind, Asians are weak."" 
John Chin, executive director of the Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation, agreed. He said the assault on the 17-year-old boy is more clearly a racial incident. ""The attackers could have attacked anyone on the street, but for some reason they sought out this particular family on the street and attacked them,"" he said. 
As for the punching of the takeout owner, Chin said the assailant might have ""felt the bravado to physically intimidate him"" because of stereotypes of Asian Americans, including that they are weak or might not report incidents to police. 
Elijah Anderson, a Yale University sociology professor, who studies urban communities like Philadelphia, said he disagreed that Asians are targeted because they are perceived as weak. 
""It's complicated,"" he said. Attacks on any group of people can come from another group who feel their ""race is better than other people"" or who ""feel their own group is under threat,"" he said. 
Lin's wife, who asked not to be identified by name because she feared for her safety, said Monday that she thinks her husband was punched because of his Asian face. ""They think Asian people is weak,"" she said at her husband's Kensington takeout, which closed after the attack. 
She showed pictures and videos of her husband playing with their daughters, now 19 months and 3 months old. Her husband, who immigrated to this country from China's Fujian province then became an American citizen, often helped people, she said. 
Police last week arrested Figueroa, of the 4000 block of North Sixth Street, in the fatal attack on Lin. He posted bail and has been released as he awaits a preliminary hearing. 
His attorney, Geoffrey Seay, said Figueroa was called to the accident scene at L and Luzerne Streets by his mother or another woman who was in the other vehicle. He declined to comment on the case except to say, ""This isn't a hate crime."" 
The takeout's delivery driver, speaking in Mandarin Chinese on Wednesday, said through an interpreter that he, too, was injured. He said that after Lin was punched, the assailant and two other men in the other group pushed him to the ground. He said he was hit in the back, arm, chest, and eye. 
On Monday, Huynh walked with Yue Xian Wu, the grandmother of the 17-year-old boy who was punched, to the scene of the teen's attack. Wu, speaking in Mandarin Chinese, described how she and her grandson were walking about 7 p.m. Friday on Hawthorne Street near Friendship, next to Mayfair Elementary School, when two teens, about 17 or 18 years old, ran toward her grandson and punched him in the face, ear, and back. 
A girl around the same age came over and started laughing, then left with the two assailants, Wu said. 
""She feel like they treat us like a toy, like an entertainment and hit us for fun, for a game,"" Huynh said of Wu, interpreting for her. ""She feel like Asians don't report to the police and don't speak English,"" making them an ""easy target."" 
Wu's grandson, Yuheng Chen, suffered a bloody nose, bruises on his right ear, temporary dizziness, and various cuts. But he didn't seek medical treatment. Speaking at the home he shares with his grandmother, he brushed off the incident, saying he didn't want to bother people. Although he initially reported the attack, he expressed reluctance about following up with police about it. ""I don't want other people to feel I'm sad,"" he said. 
""This is not normal,"" Huynh told Chen. ""This is not right. That's why I'm fighting. ... If we don't stand up for ourselves, the police cannot help. They can only do so much.... You'll only be a victim if you continue to be like, 'Oh, they hit me, that's OK.' If anyone hit me like that, I will yell. I will make the whole town know about it and I'd say, 'Stop it.",6368
Restaurant Owner Speaks Out About Racist Encounter,"Tamanaha, Akemi",Others,2021-06-30,"An Asian American restaurant owner in Atlanta says a customer sent her racist and threatening text messages, FOX 5 Atlanta reports. 
Tse-chih Chang, the owner of Grand China Restaurant, says she received racist text messages from a customer after explaining that it would take longer than usual to provide a refund. 
Last Sunday, a woman had called to cancel an order that was taking too long to deliver. Chang explained that they would cancel the order, but it would take a while to give the customer a refund, FOX 5 Atlanta reports. She assured the customer the refund would come eventually. 
The woman called the restaurant multiple times from two different numbers demanding a refund. When the refund finally went through, Chang texted a photo of the transaction to the woman's phone. That's when the harassing texts began. 
The woman called Chang an expletive, threatened to physically harm her and blamed her for COVID-19. 
Many Asian restaurants have faced racism and harassment since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In March 2020, just a few weeks into lockdown, a Chinese restaurant in Washington had its windows smashed, NBC News reports. The vandal also left a message on the side of the building: ""Take the corona back you ch*nk."" 
A ramen restaurant in Texas was vandalized with racist phrases like ""Go back to China"" after its owner spoke out against lifting the state's mask mandate in March 2021, CBS News reports. 
""The community has to try to get along and support each other. We should respect each other, and we should not look down upon or trash any race,"" Chang told FOX 5

Anti-Asian racism hurts everyone,None,Others,2021-06-11,"The recent rise in anti-Asian hate crimes are horrific and heartbreaking, but also just the latest instance of anti- Asian hate in our country. 
In the past month alone, stories of hate crimes and racist language against Asian-Americans have become commonplace on social media and news outlets. These attacks don't just harm their victims, they also harm the mental and physical health of Asian-Americans and all Americans. 
As an Asian-American physician, I would know. 
Of the 2,000 students who attended my high school in Omaha, Nebraska, there were a total of seven or eight Asians in the whole school - amid only 12 students of color. I felt the pressure of wanting to fit in of wanting to be white - and that pressure of course took a toll on my well-being. 
The numerous instances of anti-Asian racism we experience - from seemingly less serious jokes about our eyes; to having, ""Go back to [insert wrong country here]!"" yelled at us; to being the victim of or witness to physical attacks have dire consequences for our health. Trauma after trauma compounds, and racist barriers to health 
care make it even harder to treat. 
But it's not just Asian-Americans who are harmed by these racist actions, it's all of us. 
Take, for example, the Asian hate enabled by many during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are all tired of the pandemic: having to quarantine, avoid loved ones, and wear a mask all the time bothers us - it's only human. 
When our lives are interrupted and filled with worry and frustration, we're faced with a decision about how to move forward. Unfortunately, in American history, it's been common for some to spiral into negativity and seek someone to blame - as we've seen with Japanese internment camps, McCarthyism and Islamophobia following 9/11. 
Like a nervous athlete who gets inside his or her head and 'chokes', some people make a worried situation worse by becoming negative and hateful contributing to the heavy mental and physical burden already carried by 
Asian Americans. 
But think also of where we could be as a nation had those Americans channeled their energy into eradicating the pandemic and easing the economic burden it caused. 
- 
Nervous athletes don't have to choke with the right mindset they can use this energy to instead have sometimes unbelievable performances - when you hear of an athlete ""in the zone,"" this is what they mean. 
If we want to be stronger if we all want to be healthier and happier - we have to learn how to channel our energy not into hate, racism, or blame, but into positive solutions.

"Filipino Man Punched, Told to Go Back to Where He Came From at Manhattan Subway Station","Tamanaha, Akemi",Others,2021-06-09	,"A Filipino man says he was punched and told to go back to his home country on a Manhattan subway, ABC7 reports. 
He says the attack happened at around 7:20 a.m. when he got off the 6 train at the 103rd Street station on the Upper East Side. He saw someone attacking an Asian man and shouting ""go back to where you came from."" 
The attacker approached the Filipino man after his first victim escaped and punched him repeatedly. 
""Go back to where you came from,"" the attacker allegedly shouted at the victim. 
The man asked ABC 7 not to reveal his name or his face. He did however show his bloody face mask a proof of the attack. 
This is the latest in a number of attacks against Asian Americans in New York City. In March, an Asian man was pushed onto the subway tracks in Queens, according to ABC 7. That same month, a Filipina woman was kicked and beaten outside an apartment building, The New York Times reports. ",917
Fighting racism calls for all to take a clear stand against it,"Chua, Mui Hoang",Others,2021-06-11,"This means calling it out, in public and online, rather than shrugging it off to keep up the pretence of getting along 
Racism has been much in the news after a video was widely circulated of a Chinese man scolding an Indian man, who was out with his girlfriend, for preying on Chinese girls. The Chinese man was heard on video calling their relationship a disgrace and saying they should date within their own race. 
Mr Dave Parkash, 26, is of Indian-Filipino descent and his girlfriend Jacqueline Ho, 27, is half-Thai and half-Chinese Singaporean. The encounter was filmed by Ms Ho and made public by Mr Parkash, and rapidly went viral. 
This came after an incident last month, when a Singaporean Indian woman out exercising with her face mask on that left her nose uncovered, was asked to wear her mask properly, and then reportedly kicked in her chest by a Chinese man uttering racial slurs. 
Many have spoken up against these incidents, which are being investigated by the police. 
Watching the latest video, I wondered what was on the Chinese man's mind when he accosted Mr Parkash thus in public. If you listen to his words, he appears to be making an assumption that many other Chinese Singaporeans will agree with him - that it is a disgrace to date outside one's race. 
What struck me was not his sentiment - many of us would have heard similar comments on social media, or from relatives and friends. What struck me was how such bigoted views, once privately expressed in closed groups, were being expressed in public. As Irish writer Oscar Wilde observed, hypocrisy is the compliment vice pays to virtue, so keeping mum on one's private bigoted views at least acknowledges the virtue of social norms that frown on the expression of such unsavoury views. 
That the lecturer felt able to confront Mr Parkash publicly with his own bigoted views made me wonder if he felt others in society would agree with him. 
That was what made me uncomfortable - the realisation that in Singapore, we may be creating a social environment where people think it is acceptable to mouth racist words and to chide those from minority communities for failing to conform to certain expectations. 
Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam, who has been quick to call out such racist incidents in the past, shared on his Facebook page: ""I used to believe that Singapore was moving in the right direction on racial tolerance and harmony. Based on recent events, I am not so sure anymore."" 
Are things getting worse? If so, what has changed, and how did we get here? 
THE 3CS: CECA AND COVID-19 AND CULTURE CLASH 
Several forces converge to expose existing fault lines on race. 
First is the Ceca factor. Short for the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement, Ceca is a free trade agreement between Singapore and India that eases the movement of goods, services and people between the two countries, allowing for easier business travel and for intra-company transfers. It has been blamed for facilitating the entry of Indian migrants to compete for jobs with Singaporeans. 
Sociological theories on racism include a view that racism springs from resource competition. In this view, prejudice towards another race is due to competitive pressure for jobs, status or political power. 
One can construct an explanation for this quite easily: Indian skilled workers take away jobs from locals; they may even hire among their own kind (economic competition). 
Status competition is complex and extends to all major races. The arrival of highly-skilled and high-income Indian nationals with superior attitudes and caste consciousness upsets other Indian Singaporeans who feel they are looked down upon by the new arrivals. 
The Chinese may also feel threatened if this group takes jobs and leadership positions away from them, or outbids them in prime housing areas (economic competition). The new Indian immigrants who become citizens influence the vote (political competition). Meanwhile, the Malays may also feel threatened if the proportion of Indians in the national population rises, upsetting the long-established delicate demographic balance. 
In short, having many Indian skilled immigrants risks upsetting segments of the Singapore-born population. People may then act out of their anxiety, allowing personal bigoted views free rein. Politicians who spout such views, and failure by others to call them out as racist, also help make such views mainstream. 
Apart from Ceca fostering competition, the other factor fuelling racism is Covid-19. 
Living in a global pandemic and being forced to adopt unnatural behaviours like social distancing and avoiding the workplace, while worrying over job and income loss, causes mental stress in many. 
In May last year, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres alluded to this when he said ""the pandemic continues to unleash a tsunami of hate and xenophobia, scapegoating and scare-mongering"" and urged governments to ""act now to strengthen the immunity of our societies against the virus of hate"". 
Across the world, people stigmatise communities associated with each wave of Covid-19 infection. 
Hate speech worldwide against Chinese and East Asians rose when the virus was described as the Wuhan or Chinese virus. Closer to home, anti-Muslim sentiments surfaced in Singapore online, when there was a surge of cases in Malaysia after large-scale religious gatherings there. 
In Singapore in recent months, India and Indian nationals have been the target of online abuse as arrivals from India formed a growing proportion of imported cases, and as the Delta variant, which originated in India, became dominant here. 
While some Singaporeans think online trolls and negativity are harmless social ills, research shows that social media hate speech, when prolonged and insistent, can spark real-life acts of hate. 
In March last year, Boston University researchers tracking hate speech and other malicious activity on social media platforms noticed a spike in the use of words like ""Chinese"" and ""virus"". An international team of researchers from the United States, China, Italy, Germany, Cyprus and Iran, led by assistant professor Gianluca Stringhini, sifted large-scale data sets from Twitter and the alt-right fringe network 4chan's Politically Incorrect board, called /pol/, from Nov 1, 2019 through March 22 last year. 
According to an article on the university website: ""They reported an explosion of Sinophobia - anti-Chinese slurs, threats and conspiracy theories as the pandemic spread from China to other countries. 
""Researchers tracked a shift on Twitter to posts blaming China for the pandemic, while on /pol/, known for polarising hate speech and where people can post anonymously, the shift was toward the use of more and new Sinophobic slurs."" 
The report added: ""In April 2020, Stringhini and the other researchers issued their findings in a preliminary e-preprint as 'a call to action', warning that the online anti- Asian rhetoric evolving around the pandemic could possibly lead to hate attacks in the real world and most certainly harm international relations"". 
They were right, and the Asian-American community is today living with the reality of attacks. 
This is a chilling reminder that a climate of hate speech online creates an environment that validates sentiments of hate that can eventually escalate to acts of violence. 
Many Singaporeans have noticed a rise in race-fuelled xenophobic comment against Indian nationals online. While Singaporeans tend to draw a line between Singapore Indians and India Indians, as though negativity against non-citizens is acceptable, prejudicial and scapegoating views of any community are just wrong. It requires effort to police ourselves from racist or xenophobic behaviour. 
We must remember that there are real-life consequences to racist and xenophobic comment. 
TRIBAL INSTINCTS AND GENERATIONAL SHIFTS 
The third C that explains the heightened race awareness springs from a contest or even clash of viewpoints on race. 
On one side are those who say the long-established way of managing race relations has delivered racial harmony for decades and should continue. This includes using strong laws and social norms to maintain peace, and emphasising harmony while keeping disagreements and heated discussions behind closed doors. 
But younger Singaporeans want more candid dialogue and more recognition of latent racism. Perhaps influenced by ideas originating from the West about social justice and critical race theory (the idea that racism is not just about personal prejudice but is embedded and perpetuated by systems and policies), they want to probe race issues even if this provokes discomfort among older Singaporeans. An increasing number also point out how the Government's own pronouncements and policies accentuate racial differences, such as the statement that Singapore is not ready for a non-Chinese prime minister, or the way self-help groups are organised by race. 
Alluding to the generational divide, Leader of the Opposition and Workers' Party chief Pritam Singh wrote on his Facebook page: ""Tectonic shifts are taking place with regard to societal norms in Singapore. And in my estimation, this is being felt most strongly between younger and older Singaporeans. There will continue to be episodes of divergent cultural and generational norms."" 
Openness to hearing the lived experiences of our minority communities is the beginning of genuine understanding and integration. 
While most people do not see themselves as racist, racism is part of the human experience. 
Evolutionary psychology has taught us that humans have a tendency to view people through a tribal lens. The human brain is said to be capable of forming close ties with only about 150 people - recognising and tracking greater numbers impose too great a cognitive load. As a short cut, when interacting with large groups, say in a city, we look out for people who look like us, who are likely to be our kin, to support us. The hunter-gatherer societies from which we are descended hard-wired humans to prefer those who look like us and to view others with suspicion - so the theories go. 
Such theories explain the prevalence of racism across cultures. But even if correct, they do not excuse bigoted behaviour from modern humans with free will and intelligence, who should know better than to treat others of different skin colour as inferior creatures. 
Singaporeans especially live in a society whose cultural DNA is precisely to overcome instinctual habits of racial affiliation. It is not for nothing that we pledge ourselves, as one united people regardless of race, language or religion. 
In Singapore, many of us who love our multiracial country, cultures and cuisine, pride ourselves on not being racist. But in our eagerness to assert our multicultural credentials, we may fall into the danger of denial of racism as felt by others. 
When we say, for example, that the recent incident is due to an individual's personal or mental health issue, we are guilty of deflecting from the mainstream. We try to minimise the impact of this incident by emphasising its singularity, when in fact it might be the opposite. As Mr Parkash and many other minority commenters have noted, encounters with such racist attitudes are not uncommon. 
I have come to realise over the past year, talking to various people about race and religion, how much being a member of the majority Chinese community can blind me to the daily slights and insults felt by a non-Chinese person. Such obliviousness is not racist, but can be enablers of racism. 
Father Clifford Augustine, an Indian who sometimes describes himself as a ""big black man with a big brown dog"" Rufus, is a Franciscan friar. He told me recently: ""Do you know when I take the bus, even when it is fairly crowded, the seat next to me would be unoccupied? I am happy with that. I have the space. But it is telling."" 
We are both Singaporean. He is my friend. Hearing his quiet acceptance of his lived reality in the country of his birth tore me up inside. 
A few days later, I came across an article on racism on theconversation.com website from Australia that included this observation: ""A comment, joke or action doesn't need to be intentionally hurtful for it to be racism. But understanding this requires us to evaluate words or behaviours by their outcomes, rather than just their intention. 
""Avoiding the seat next to an Aboriginal man on the bus could be hurtful, even if it was not intended to be. Imagine how this man might often face similar scenarios on his commute to and from work."" 
Plenty of recent research has shown how repeated experiences of avoidance can accumulate to create stress and discomfort, even mental illness, in the recipient, the article added. 
This is the explanation about why ""microaggressions"" matter. These are acts, words or assumptions in daily life that are targeted at minority communities, that make them feel different and as though they do not belong. It is easy for majority communities to make light of a stray comment here and there about race. But imagine facing comments like these each time you step outside your home, day in and day out. 
Those of us who are older grew up in a Singapore where casual racism was the norm. The concept of microaggressions had not been thought of; and we expected our friends of all races to laugh along at casual banter and racist comment. 
We thought it was a mark of racial harmony that we all got along. But what if the price of that surface harmony was a thousand small cuts in the heart of our minority community friends? What if each careless comment or joke caused a small wound in his sense of self? 
We can say - we did not know then. But we know now. Should we change or hark back to the fictitious good old days? 
I am beginning to realise that to fight racism, it is not enough not to be racist. One must also be anti-racist. This means speaking up against racist comment or acts when we encounter them, online or in person. Silence is complicit. Every non-response emboldens those with latent racist views to think they have supporters among us. Thus emboldened, some will escalate their words into action. 
In fact, some already have.",14283
'A foundation for grounding a MOVEMENT': Inside the California organization tracking anti-Asian hate incidents,"Seshadri, Mallika",Others,2021-06-09,"""Collecting the data and reporting on the data and getting in front of the media and other folks was really important. Without that collaboration, without that effort, I'm sure we would have individual stories, but they would not have highlighted this challenge that we're seeing."" 
Sen. Richard Pan 
Chairperson of the California Legislature's Asian Pacific Islander Caucus 
Richard Lim was walking along a quiet sidewalk near UC Berkeley's fraternity row last summer when, he said, two men called out to him. 
""Hey Coronavirus, why don't you take yourself and go home,"" they shouted at the Asian American Studies graduate student, who was wearing a mask. ""You don't want to contaminate anyone."" 
Even within his own family, the racist harassment Lim faced was not unique. His aunt, who works at an Asian supermarket, had also experienced racist verbal attacks, making her and Lim just two of thousands of Asian Americans who have reported experiencing harassment during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Later that summer, with incidents on the rise, Lim decided to do something. He became a volunteer with Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition based in California that has recorded nearly 7,000 hate incidents involving Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders nationwide since the beginning of the pandemic and created reports based on their findings. Despite being a small volunteer organization, the group has in just over a year become a leading source for tracking incidents of hate in the country, and its work has been cited by dozens of media outlets including The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, KQED, MSNBC and NBC News. 
""Collecting the data and reporting on the data and getting in front of the media and other folks was really important,"" state Senator Richard Pan, who chairs the California Legislature's Asian Pacific Islander Caucus, said of the coalition's work. ""Without that collaboration, without that effort, I'm sure we would have individual stories, but they would not have highlighted this challenge that we're seeing."" 
Volunteers like Lim say Stop AAPI Hate's impact has extended beyond publishing reports. 
""We've grown to be more than just a data collection center,"" Lim said. ""We've become a foundation for grounding a movement."" 
Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University, co-founded Stop AAPI Hate in March 2020 along with colleagues at two Asian- American advocacy organizations, Chinese for Affirmative Action's Cynthia Choi and the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council's Manjusha Kulkarni. 
""I knew from Asian American history that when epidemics came from Asia, Asians would be blamed and then face racism,"" said Jeung. ""I quickly started documenting the racism."" 
The center soon received a number of grants from foundations, including one founded by professional basketball player Jeremy Lin, and gathered a group of volunteers and student researchers who could aid their mission. 
Nearly a year later, the state of California pitched in, setting aside $1.4 million for the Stop AAPI Hate Coalition and UCLA's Asian American Studies Center to conduct research on hate crimes against Asian Americans. 
The funding was championed by the Asian Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus. 
While the FBI, the Department of Justice and California's Attorney General's Office collect data on hate crimes in California, no government agency was systematically tracking the recent uptick in harassment of Asian Americans, Pan said. 
Volunteers review each report submitted by community members to the Stop AAPI Hate website; more than 2,800 came in during March 2021 alone. Women reported more than two thirds of all incidents in the coalition's most recent national report. About 44% involved Chinese Americans. 
While about 12% of survivors said they experienced some form of physical assault, more than two-thirds reported verbal harassment. Others reported civil rights violations, such as workplace discrimination, or online attacks. 
""When someone calls you a racial slur from a moving car, that's not something that you can necessarily call the police about. That's not violent. You are not physically hurt,"" said Chinese for Affirmative Action spokesperson Yamuna Hopwood. ""But it's hateful all the same."" 
Once received by the coalition, reports are entered into a database. If necessary, the report is then translated into English. Stop AAPI Hate does not verify the reports, Jeung said, but volunteers do ""clean up"" the data. 
That involves editing reports for spelling and grammar, but also interpreting certain aspects of a case, such as determining what type of hate incident took place, said Eric Augustus Bai, a data engineer who helped Stop AAPI Hate develop new ways to visualize their data. 
Aggregated data sets allow Stop AAPI Hate to track trends within anti-Asian racism, Jeung said. He stressed the importance of depicting racism as ""widespread, institutionalized and systemic."" Recent reports from the coalition have analyzed the impact of racism on different Asian American ethnicities, on women and girls and on mental health. 
Stop AAPI Hate may be new, but it's rooted in the work of people with years of experience focusing on Asian American issues, said Karin Wang, a professor of public interest law at UCLA and the former vice president of programs at Asian Americans Advancing Justice. 
""In terms of what they were able to come together and do, I do think it's been really impactful,"" she said. ""I mean, we live in an age where data drives everything."" 
Brian Levin, who directs the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at Cal State University, San Bernardino, said Stop AAPI Hate's findings line up with his own research, which focuses on crimes reported to police. Using police data, the center found that hate crimes against Asians in the U.S. increased by almost 200% between the first quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 - a sign, Levin said, that the trend has not yet peaked. 
Some community members have contacted Stop AAPI Hate in the wake of an incident as an alternative to calling the police, organizers say. The coalition does not have the capacity to directly respond to incidents of harassment, but plans to create online resources to help survivors, including multilingual videos that address actions people can take if bullied, ways to talk to a child dealing with trauma and how to talk to family about race. 
Volunteers also work on other projects aimed at changing common narratives about Asian Americans. 
""If part of the issue is that Asians are being represented or seen as perpetual foreigners and treated as foreigners to be objectified and attacked, then we have to change that narrative,"" Jeung said. ""And narrative work involves education."" 
This past school year, more than 20 high school interns helped the coalition create social media campaigns and a series of workshops covering intersectionality, the yellow peril stereotype, Japanese American incarceration and mental health. 
Rebecca Wu, a junior at Alhambra High School, spent part of the year developing the workshops, which will be posted on the center's website for use in high school classrooms and student club meetings. 
""I was looking at the worksheets we made, the slides and the outline of the lesson...I was just so amazed,"" Wu said. ""That was kind of when I felt like, well, like we could be taken seriously."" 
Stop AAPI Hate has also been working with Asian American students to learn about their concerns and ideas for increased safety on school campuses. Student leaders drafted a letter with their suggestions which range from expanding mental health services to creating a multilingual, online hub for students to anonymously report hate incidents and State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond sent it to district superintendents and charter school administrators on Thursday. 
As the coalition has reported more and more cases, its volunteers say they've had to balance their own emotional struggles with the tasks at hand. 
""It's really hard,"" Hopwood said. ""Acknowledging pain and suffering that victims feel, that we feel vicariously through them, (is) an important step to realize that this is not okay."" 
Jeung said he often spends his day being ""pulled from all sides,"" tending to media requests, working with corporations interested in donating to Stop AAPI Hate and attending listening sessions run by the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services and the White House. 
Each day, he said, he goes through ""the range of emotions, from anger to depression to hope."" 
""We're still grieving over the Atlanta shootings. We're still angered by seeing our elderly pushed and shoved,"" Jeung said. ""That's, for me, a real heavy burden to support the community at the moment."" 
Others, like San Francisco State University graduate student Boaz Tang, who has been reviewing incident reports for the past year, say they are using their anger to fuel their volunteer work, instead of just stewing. 
""I'm going to try to do what I can with the opportunities that I have, just so I don't have to sit on my rage and feel numb,"" Tang said. 
Although Stop AAPI Hate seeks to uplift Asian American communities during a time of need, the coalition has faced criticism for its name. And some activists say they worry that the focus on anti-Asian hate incidents is getting co-opted in a way that will lead to more police presence and targeting of Black people within Asian American communities. 
Jacob Lacuesta, an Asian American Studies graduate student at San Francisco State, said he supports the coalition's efforts but that the name Stop AAPI Hate homogenizes the Asian American community and is a ""complete erasure"" of different Asian identities, leaving out South Asians and Middle Eastern people, among others. 
Jeung said naming the organization was not the coalition's top priority. ""We didn't spend a lot of time thinking about or trying to brand ourselves,"" he said. ""We're just trying to address the racism."" 
While the Stop AAPI Hate coalition has called for allyship between different marginalized communities, Lacuesta said some media coverage of attacks on Asian Americans has perpetuated anti-Blackness. ""Though there are perpetrators of many backgrounds, Black individuals tend to get the most media attention,"" he said. 
For example, a Fox News segment from last month falsely suggested there is a conspiracy by other news organizations and Democrats to not ""identify the race of the attackers"" and strongly implied a majority of those attackers were Black. 
While Stop AAPI Hate does not advocate for increased policing as a response to the violence against Asian Americans, some government responses to the attacks have funneled resources to law enforcement, such as a new federal hate crimes law signed by President Joe Biden last month. That has drawn criticism from some of the coalition's supporters. 
""When Stop AAPI Hate is democratized as a hashtag or as a movement...once it's in the world, you don't get to control it, you don't really get to reel it back, there's no undo button,"" said Tang. ""It's really cool that the movement has grown. But also, things can get co-opted, and it can be taken places that the people who started the organization never intended."" 
Moving forward, members of the Stop AAPI Hate coalition say they hope to continue their work combating white supremacy, while seeking to cultivate relationships with different communities of color. 
Lim, the volunteer who said he was harassed near UC Berkeley, noted that Asian Americans have faced discrimination in the United States since the early 1800s. 
""This historical moment is nothing new,"" Lim said. ""It doesn't take long to go back even 10 to 15 years to see different forms of anti-Asian hate come across in national political discourse, to understand how Asian Americans are consistently seen as the perpetual foreigner."" 
Although racism against Asian Americans predates the pandemic, Hopwood said the events of the past two years provided an opportunity to create new solutions. 
""This did not start when the pandemic did, and it won't end when the pandemic ends,"" she said. ""It's all about taking the energy and a lot of the attention that this issue has gathered in this moment and trying to channel it into long-term, meaningful change.""

"Reports of anti-Asian hate top 10,000",Randall,Others,2021-11-18,"A new study just released by Stop AAPI Hate reveals that reports of hate from Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have now reached 10,370. 
The period covered begins with the start of the pandemic from March 19, 2020 to September 30, 2021. 
A survey released in conjunction with the report found Asian Americans with a high school education are experiencing hate at twice the rate of those with at least some college. 
41 out of 100 of those who halted their education after high school report being victims of anti-Asian hate versus 20% of those who entered college and 13% of those with a BA or higher degree. 
""It's tragic but not surprising that Asian Americans with lower education levels are experiencing more hate,"" said Cynthia Choi, co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate and co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action. ""Anti-Asian hate is tied to systemic racism against our community. Stopping hate is not about quick fixes like law enforcement but about deeper investment in our communities."" 
Equally troubling for Asian American parents, 30% report their children have experienced anti-Asian hate in school. 31% of Pacific Islander parents report the same thing about their kids. 
""The levels of Asian American children experiencing hate in school is devastatingly high,"" said Russell Jeung, Ph.D., co- founder of Stop AAPI Hate and professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University. ""There needs to be an urgent push toward incorporating solutions that promote racial understanding in schools, including through investment in Ethnic Studies."" 
However, the concern is not limited to just children. Adults report being worried about going back to work due to the backlash facing many Asian Americans. 
31% of Asian Americans and 26.4% of Pacific Islanders say they've experienced a hate incident at work during the past 
year. 
23.5% of Asian Americans and 21.7% of Pacific Islanders say they fear going back to work because of potential hate or discrimination. 
""When it comes to stopping anti-Asian hate, our elected leaders should be responsive to the Asian American community,"" Manjusha Kulkarni, co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate and executive director of Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council. ""Locally and nationally, they must make real investments in civil rights, community resources, and education.” 
AsAmNews has done numerous reports on efforts to further education about Asian Americans in the schools. 
More education and public awareness is cited as the number one solution by 
52.8% for AAs and 57.5% for PIs. 
Community-based solutions and civil rights rank 2nd and 3rd ahead of more law enforcement. ",2657
'Go eat some f*cking rice': Man says he's Being Racist to Protect his Country,"Tamanaha, Akemi",Others,2021-10-13,"A video posted on Reddit's r/PublicFreakout forum featuring a white man admitting to being racist towards an Asian American man has gone viral. 
The video was posted by Reddit user u/tefunka and taken in the parking lot of 798 House, a restaurant in El Monte, California. It shows an Asian American man confronting a white man in the parking lot. 
The white man can be seen calling the Asian American ""f*cking Chinese"" and an ""Asian motherf*cker."" He tells the Asian American man to ""go eat some f*cking rice"" and to go back to his country. 
""I was born here, motherf*cker,"" the Asian American man replies. ""Why don't you go back to your own f*cking country?"" 
The White man tells the Asian American man that ""this is [his] country."" The Asian American man asks him if he is an aboriginal, referencing the fact that Native Americans were in the country before either of them. 
The Asian American man also calls the White man a racist, and the White man admits to being racist. 
""Yeah, I'm f*cking racist,"" the man replies. ""I'm protecting my f*cking country, you motherf**ker."" 
It is unclear how the incident started. The Reddit post states that the man called the driver a racist slur, and the Asian American man, who was also a passenger defended the driver. The video has gone viral on Reddit.

MAN BANNED AFTER WOMAN WAS SPIT ON UW CAMPUS  HATE CRIME ALLEGED,"Meyerhofer, Kelly",Others,2021-10-02,"UW-Madison Police arrested a man on a tentative charge of disorderly conduct with a hate crime enhancer after he allegedly spit on and made comments about COVID-19 
to an Asian-American student last month. 
Morgan R. Kroll, 37, of Madison, was arrested Monday and appeared in court Thursday, police spokesperson Marc Lovicott said. UW-Madison Police identified Kroll through security cameras and with the assistance of the Madison Police Department. 
Kroll, who is not affiliated with UW-Madison, is now banned from the campus as part of his court-ordered bail conditions. A phone message left with Kroll's attorney, Jason Gonzalez, was not returned Friday. 
The student told police she was walking on West Dayton Street near Ogg Hall shortly before 10 p.m. on Sept. 15 when a man approached her, spat in her face and made statements about COVID-19. She told investigators she felt targeted because of her race and appearance. 
Racist, anti-Chinese graffiti appeared on the UW-Madison campus at the beginning of the pandemic. One message said, ""It's from China #CHINESEVIRUS,"" mirroring language used by President Donald Trump despite the World Health Organization going out of its way to avoid including people or places when naming the disease. 
University officials denounced behavior blaming China for COVID-19 and held a town hall for students in March 2020. They said at the time that 82 bias incident reports had been filed so far in the spring 2020 semester, more than half of which involved discrimination toward Asian or international students.

UC investigates instructor calling COVID-19 'the Chinese virus',"Mitchell, Madeline",Others,2020-09-19,"A University of Cincinnati dean is investigating an email to an engineering student in which an adjunct instructor
is accused of referring to the novel coronavirus as ""the Chinese virus."" The email came after the student had to
miss a lab session due to being quarantined for possible exposure to the novel coronavirus.
""I think that the school should take disciplinary actions against the professor because (his) actions completely
violate the school's values,"" 20-year-old Evan Sotzing told The Enquirer Thursday evening.
UC investigation underway
University spokeswoman M.B. Reilly said Thursday night that the ""matter has already come to the attention of
the dean who is already looking into this on behalf of the student.""
Sotzing said he has been in contact with UC's Dean of Engineering and Applied Science, John Weidner, who he
says is ""looking into it.""
Weidner said he referred the matter for review to the university's Office of Equal Opportunity and Access. That
department handles inquiries regarding discrimination, harassment or retaliation based on disability, race, color,
religion, national origin and other identities, according to their website.
""These types of xenophobic comments and stigmatizations around location or ethnicity are more than troubling.
We can better protect and care for all when we speak about COVID-19 with both accuracy and empathy – something we should all strive for,"" Weidner wrote to The Enquirer.
Emails lay out incident
Sotzing received the email from John Ucker, who is listed as an adjunct instructor in UC's College of Engineering
and Applied Science. He did not reply to an email from The Enquirer Thursday evening.
In emails forwarded to The Enquirer, Sotzing, a third-year engineering student, wrote to Ucker that he would not
be able to attend an in-person lab scheduled for Tuesday because his girlfriend tested positive for the novel
coronavirus at UC's University Health Services.
Sotzing was tested the same day, he said, and he received a negative COVID-19 result. However, Sotzing said
the university's health officials told him to quarantine for two weeks because of his proximity to a positive
patient.
Those tests were taken on Sept. 4, Sotzing said. The lab was scheduled for Tuesday, on Sept. 15, which would
have fallen in the two-week quarantine time period.
Sotzing provided photo evidence of his test results in an email to Ucker, and wrote that he had been told not to
attend any in-person classes until Thursday. Ucker did not reply to Sotzing's email until after the in-person lab
had already happened.
""For students testing positive for the chinese (sic) virus, I will give no grade,"" the email reads. ""You can read the
info I sent to the class re: the torsion test.""
'This kind of language is completely unacceptable'
UC stated in its Return to Campus Guide that it encourages faculty to be flexible with students, especially in
regards to attendance policies during the pandemic. Weidner said Ucker has a ""routine policy"" of allowing
students to forego one of the lab tests so that a grade will not be recorded.
UC has reported 321 COVID-19 cases among students as of Thursday. Hamilton County officials said this week
the positive rate for the new coronavirus is spiking in Cincinnati's Corryville, Mount Auburn and CUF (Clifton
Heights/University Heights/Fairview) neighborhoods around UC.
Sotzing said he is not clear whether Ucker's message meant he was getting a zero grade or if the professor is
merely not grading the assignment.
""This kind of language is completely unacceptable. And especially from people, like, in power... it has no place in
this country and it contributes to Asian xenophobia,"" Sotzing said.
Sotzing posted the professor's email response on Twitter Thursday afternoon.
""My girlfriend tested positive for COVID and the University of Cincinnati's Health Department instructed me to
not attend my in-person lab. Not only did my professor give me a zero for not going, but this was his response,""
the post reads, with a screenshot of the email. Within three hours, the post had over 6,000 likes and over 2,000
retweets.
""He needs to apologize for the fact that he made that comment,"" Sotzing told The Enquirer Thursday.

Plainfield official sued over alleged racist COVID-19 comments,"Muscavage, Nick",Others,2020-09-23,"PLAINFIELD – A Fanwood man is suing a Plainfield Fire Department official and the city over claims he was the
victim of discrimination because of comments made to him about COVID-19.
Timothy Burkhard, who is Asian American, filed a lawsuit against Plainfield and Deputy Fire Chief Pietro Martino,
after Martino made discriminatory comments about Burkhard's ethnicity and the coronavirus, according to the
lawsuit.
Burkhard, who was hired as a firefighter at the Plainfield Fire Department in July 2018, filed his lawsuit in Union
County Superior Court in July. The case was dismissed but was later reinstated by Union County Superior Court
Judge Mark Ciarrocca on Sept. 11.
In March, Martino began to make ""racist comments about Asians"" to Burkhard during the fire department's
training on COVID-19, according to the lawsuit.
Martino ""mockingly"" asked Burkhard if he had recently been to Wuhan, China ""while he squinted his eyes so that
they narrowed in a racist caricature of Asian facial features and left his mouth open,"" according to the lawsuit.
The ""outrageous conduct"" was witnessed by at least 19 firefighters attending the training, the lawsuit claims.
Five lieutenants and a battalion chief were among those present.
None of the firefighters present objected to Martino's comments or told him they were inappropriate, according to the lawsuit. Martino never apologized.
Burkhard's lawyer, Pitman based-attorney Sebastian Ionno, called Martino's alleged comments ""appalling.""
""It is even more appalling that the City of Plainfield was provided timely notice of this incident and failed to
remediate or repudiate this repulsive racist and divisive conduct,"" he said in a statement. ""Thankfully, New
Jersey's Law Against Discrimination does not change with the political winds and always prohibits discrimination
even when a person's race or ethnicity may not be popular due to external world events.""
Plainfield did not respond to requests for comment.
Martino's conduct has resulted in a workplace where firefighters ""now believe it is acceptable workplace behavior
to openly disparage Asian-Americans for their race and as being responsible for the spread of Coronavirus,""
according to the lawsuit.
Because of Martino's ""grossly discriminatory conduct,"" Burkhard has been subjected to a hostile workplace
environment because of his race.
Martino has also been involved in several other ""harassment incidents,"" according to the lawsuit.
Burkhard, in his lawsuit, contends that Plainfield and Martino violated the state Law Against Discrimination in
disregard of his rights.
As a result, Burkhard has suffered annoyance, inconvenience, stress, anxiety, humiliation, depression and
severe emotional distress, the lawsuit says.
Burkhard's lawsuit is not the first time racial discrimination has been alleged at the Plainfield Fire Department.
In 2018, Plainfield agreed to pay $450,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by a former deputy fire chief alleging he was
the victim of discrimination.
Jeffrey Courtney, who is white, filed a lawsuit in 2016 against former Plainfield Fire Chief Frank Tidwell, the city
and fire department alleging that he was not promoted to chief based on the color of his skin.
The settlement also included Courtney's retirement. According to public records, Courtney made $140,140 as
deputy fire chief.
Tidwell filed his own lawsuit against the city, the mayor and multiple officials alleging that they engaged in a
conspiracy to force him into retirement. Mayor Adrian Mapp was dismissed from the lawsuit last year.
The lawsuit is ongoing in Union County Superior Court.

U.S. officials need to stop spreading ‘political virus’ that fuels racial discrimination,None,Others,2020-09-16,"Racial discrimination has always been a scar on the American society, one that has been continuously ripped wider open since
the COVID-19 pandemic.
As some U.S. politicians are bent on politicizing the pandemic and maliciously making China a scapegoat for their
incompetence in containing the outbreak, the virus of racial discrimination against Asian Americans is also spreading across
the country.
Asian Americans are frequently humiliated and even attacked in public, and suffering continuous discrimination on social
media platforms.
The racial group faced a double whammy of unemployment and discrimination amid the outbreak, according to many reports
recently released by American research institutions and civil society organizations.
However, some U.S. officials have played dumb about the situation, which has fully revealed the hypocrisy and cruelty of the
so-called American human rights.
Relevant data have been rather dreadful. Racial discrimination against Asian Americans is becoming more common, pointed
out a survey report from American think tank Pew Research Center.
31 percent of Asian Americans said they have been subject to racist slurs or jokes since the pandemic began, while 26
percent said they’ve feared someone might physically attack them, the survey found.
As the number of racist attacks against Asian Americans in various areas of New York has increased significantly, the New
York City Police Department has even established an Asian Hate Crime Task Force recently, the first task force in the U.S. that
is aimed at Asian hate crimes.
Across the country, Asian American health-care workers have reported a rise in bigoted incidents, according to an article
published on The Washington Post.
The racial hostility has left Asian Americans, who represent 6 percent of the U.S. population but 18 percent of the country’s
physicians and 10 percent of its nurse practitioners, in a painful position on the front lines of the response to the coronavirus
pandemic, the article said.
“Some COVID-19 patients refuse to be treated by them. And when doctors and nurses leave the hospital, they face increasing
harassment in their daily lives, too,” it continued.
What lies at the root of such pernicious consequences is certain U.S. politicians’ misdeed of spreading “political virus”.
Some U.S. officials have taken every opportunity and played every trick they can to attack and stigmatize China, including
calling the COVID-19 “Chinese virus” and “Wuhan virus”, which has fostered extremism and racism in the U.S. and become
the main culprit of the dramatically increasing attacks and threats targeting Asian Americans.
The attacks and smear campaign launched against China by some American politicians have ignited anti-Asian sentiment,
according to an article published by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).
“Yet public figures and politicians play a key role in promoting racial equality and non-discrimination principles. In this
regards, it is dismaying to witness State officials adopting alternative named for the COVID-19 coronavirus,” said Tendayi
Achiume, the United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and
related intolerance.
“Indeed, instead of using the internationally recognized name of the virus, these (U.S.) officials have adopted names with
geographic references, typically referring to its emergence in China. This sort of calculated use of a geographic-based name
for this virus is rooted in and fosters racism and xenophobia,” she pointed out in a recent statement.
Systemic racism is a malady afflicting the American society.
Color has obviously played a major role in determining the fate of many Americans, U.S. scholar Thomas Sowell wrote in his
book Ethnic America: A History.
In history, the notorious Chinese Exclusion Act and crimes against Asian Americans such as sending a large number of Asians
to concentration camps during the World War II have startled the world.
Asian Americans now still suffer continuous harassment, exclusion and structural discrimination in the U.S., arousing great
concern among the international community and American people with breadth of vision.
This year, the special procedures of the U.N. Human Rights Council have repeatedly condemned the U.S. for its racial
discrimination and hate speech.
Recent hate crimes and violent assaults against people of Asian descent should sound an alarm for America, said nearly 200
American foreign policy scholars and former diplomats in a joint statement issued on USA Today.
They called upon U.S. leaders at every level and in every sector to take action against anti-Asian racism and express support
for Asian diaspora and Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities.
Only those who lack competence themselves would deliberately invent divisions and confrontations against others.
The conflicts and antagonisms in the American society won’t stop worsening unless certain U.S. officials break off the political
scheme to pass the buck to China for their misconduct in dealing with the epidemic.
Otherwise, other groups of people, in addition to Asian Americans, may end up a new victim of some U.S. officials.
In the U.S., a country that claims to be a “beacon of freedom”, some U.S. politicians, however, have ignored the international
human rights law, openly incited and condoned racial discrimination, and violated the bottom line of human civilization by
blatantly trampling on human rights, which is by no means tolerable.

Drawing on her experience,"Wang, Qian",Others,2020-09-02,"With a popular online comic strip, overseas Chinese artist Cao Siyu lightheartedly sets about deconstructing
stereotypes and cultural misunderstandings between East and West, Wang Qian reports.
What is the difference between Chinese and Western cultures? For visual designer Cao Siyu, the answer is often
a simple one, and it can usually be found in her comics, which highlight cultural differences and connections
based on her experiences and observations while living abroad.
Born and raised in Beijing, Cao, 32, left home at 20 to study in the United States for her bachelor's degree in
English literature and, later, the United Kingdom for her master's degree in graphic design. She now runs a
visual thinking workshop in Paris. Visual thinking is defined as ""any mental process based on the visual
processing capabilities of the mind"", a common mode of thinking alongside verbal, kinesthetic, musical and
mathematical thinking.
""My experience shows that although travel is much easier and faster today, the distance between cultures
doesn't shorten,"" Cao says, adding that she wants to build a bridge and break the stereotypes between different
cultures.
""After staying in three countries, I have much to tell about the usual shock while adapting to life in new
cultures, so I started drawing the web comic to share my experiences and observations as a Chinese person
living abroad,"" Cao says, adding that after 12 years overseas, she can understand situations from both sides.
After she encountered many misunderstandings and came face to face with stereotypical views, about China,
Cao was inspired to create Tiny Eyes Comics, an internet-based cartoon strip illustrating the ""big world through
tiny Chinese eyes"".Since her first illustration in late 2016, Cao has posted more than 300 comics to her
Instagram account, which has attracted about 41,000 followers.
Focusing on everyday topics, including family relationships, food, different ways of thinking and social customs,
Cao's comics feature a girl named Tiny Eyes and portray her life in a lighthearted way.
""Although Tiny Eyes looks similar to me, she is not me. She can be anyone who feels related to the experience,""
Cao says, adding that the comics can shed light on China for foreigners who are curious about the country.
A book of the Tiny Eyes comics was published in France in May last year and an English version is currently in
production.
Its French publisher Equateur says about the book: ""In a few strokes, Siyu Cao produces scenes of everyday life
¡• and challenges the prejudices and representations we make of each other, deconstructing them with personal
anecdotes.""
Italian magazine Grazia says: ""Her simple sketches have played a big part in demystifying Chinese culture.""
Her comic creation has continued and COVID-19 has made her realize how important it is to help people from
different cultural backgrounds to communicate with each other. Using her pencil, she hopes that her drawings
can help people stay connected in a socially-distanced world.
One of her comics shows the cultural differences behind the debate about usage of masks, which has been a
divisive topic throughout the pandemic. To wear or not to wear, that is the question that has led to unexpected
controversy and, in some cases, even physical conflict, in some parts of the world.
At the beginning of the outbreak, Cao heard a case about an Asian woman in France wearing a mask being
insulted and expelled from a train by other passengers.
In a bid to illustrate the cultural approach to the wearing of masks, she posted a comic strip illustrating a
Chinese girl wearing a mask on the metro being stared at weirdly by others. In the strip she explains that
Chinese people wear masks to prevent infection, as well as avoid passing the virus to others, especially since
the SARS outbreak in 2002-03, while before April, the French were encouraged to wear a mask only when
showing coronavirus symptoms.
As France has witnessed a record high COVID-19 surge in recent months, several cities, including Paris and
Nice, last month made masks mandatory.
""The wearing of masks is just one example of a cultural difference that can trigger tension, even discrimination,
during the pandemic,"" she says.
Many people around the world have commented on the post. An Instagram user named Carjoyflo said:
""Fascinating cultural difference. That helps explain it - I have a number of Chinese international students at my
California school who are wearing masks."" Another user, Vagabondying, said: ""Exactly the same in Italy. Very
well explained.""
One of her popular illustrations shows how complicated French cutlery compares to the Chinese tradition of
using chopsticks. Chinese people can use chopsticks to eat everything, but in France, there are no less than
eight types of fork, knife and spoon required to finish a single, multiple-course meal.
Another culinary difference between Chinese and Westerners is hot water. In her illustration, no matter if it is
winter or summer, in a French restaurant, sparkling water is always served before the meal; in the US, the default is usually water with ice; while in China, people drink hot water a lot, because unprocessed tap water
is undrinkable and people believe that hot water is good for the health.
Besides food culture, she also covers expressions of love in her comics. Although emotions are universal, how
to express them differs between East and West. In her illustrations, while an American professes love for her
mother directly over the phone, Tiny Eyes displays the same sentiment by asking after the health of her loved
ones and buying nice things to make their life more comfortable.
Many foreign readers say they find her illustrations enlightening, helping them to understand China, while
Chinese immigrants have felt seen and understood, according to Cao.
This feedback and connection with her readers has been ""the biggest motivation"" for her to keep creating.
She remembers that her comics helped an English teacher who adopted her daughter from China in 2002
gain ""great insight"" about the culture behind her little girl.
A neurosurgeon in Berlin, who was born in China, but grew up in Germany and studied in the US and Italy,
thanked her, saying: ""I really love your comics, they are not only cute and funny, but portray complex and
multilayered issues and thoughts in a very intelligent and light way.
""I am sure that they are also inspiration for those who have completely different upbringings and cultural
backgrounds and that is the beauty of your work.""

Increased racism against Asian-Americans amid pandemic: Report,None,Others,2020-09-18,"Los Angeles, Sep 18 (IANS) A report released by a US civil rights group showed Asian-Americans have
experienced increased racism since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country more than 6 months ago.
The report was issued on Thursday by the Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center, which was formed in March by the
Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, Chinese for Affirmative Action and San Francisco State University's
Asian American Studies department, reports Xinhua news agency.
As of August 5, the report said, 2,583 incidents of anti-Asian discrimination nationwide had been self-reported,
in which over 40 per cent, namely 1,116 reports, occurred in California.Reports submitted to the group were likely under-counted, the survey noted, citing that 5.4 per cent of Asian-
Americans in California reported being ""unfairly treated"" due to race or ethnicity, compared to 2.1 per cent of allstate residents during pandemic.
The report underlined the impact of racism and xenophobia against Asian-American youth during the pandemic,
while analyzing 341 incidents of anti-Asian discrimination involving youth reported to the Stop AAPI Hate
Reporting Center from March 19 to July 22.
""In over half (56 per cent) of these cases, perpetrators employed anti-Chinese hate speech, including blaming
China and Chinese as the source of the virus and mocking Chinese dietary habits.
""Even though adults were present in almost half of the incidents (48 per cent), bystanders intervened in only 10
per cent of the cases,"" the report said.
Tony Thurmond, California State Superintendent of Public Instruction, was quoted as saying that country is
suffering two pandemics: Covid-19 and racism.
""It breaks my heart that so many of our Asian-American and Pacific Islander youth and families have been
subject to demeaning, discriminatory attacks,"" he said.
""All Asian Americans are being hit hard by the groundswell of anti-Asian rhetoric promoted by our president, but
youth are particularly vulnerable,"" warned Russell Jeung, professor of Asian-American studies at San Francisco
State University.
""The hate Asian-American youths are facing could cause irreparable damage to their self-identity and social
relationships.""

Professor on leave after 'Chinese virus' email,"Mitchell, Madeline",Others,2020-09-24,"The University of Cincinnati professor accused of referring to COVID-19 as ""the Chinese virus"" has been put on
administrative leave with pay.
In an email sent to adjunct instructor John Ucker, UC's College of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean John
Weidner wrote that Ucker's courses will be handled by another faculty member for the time being.
""As you are aware, a student in one of your courses has raised a concern regarding one of your emails. This
matter has been referred to UC's Office of Equal Opportunity and Access (""OEOA"") for review. As such, effective
immediately you are being placed on an administrative leave with pay pending the outcome of that review,"" the
email reads.
Ucker's ""full cooperation"" with the OEOA review is ""both expected and appreciated,"" Weidner wrote.
Weidner began investigating after third-year engineering student Evan Sotzing, 20, posted on social media an
email he received from Ucker. The email came after Sotzing had to miss a lab session due to being quarantined
for possible exposure to the coronavirus.
""For students testing positive for the chinese (sic) virus, I will give no grade,"" the email reads. ""You can read the
info I sent to the class re: the torsion test.""

""I think that the school should take disciplinary actions against the professor because (his) actions completely

Sotzing said he is not clear whether Ucker's message meant he was getting a zero grade or if the professor is
merely not grading the assignment. He said he was offended by what he called ""racist language"" from Ucker in
the email, and the notion that Ucker might punish a student for adhering to national, state and local health
guidelines.
The following morning, Weidner confirmed that the matter was referred for review to the OEOA. That
department handles inquiries regarding discrimination, harassment or retaliation based on disability, race, color,
religion, national origin and other identities, according to its website.
""These types of xenophobic comments and stigmatizations around location or ethnicity are more than troubling.
We can better protect and care for all when we speak about COVID-19 with both accuracy and empathy –
something we should all strive for,"" Weidner wrote to The Enquirer.
News of the investigation came on the same day that the U.S. House of Representatives passed a measure
condemning anti-Asian bigotry and discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Increased numbers of Asian Americans have reported harassment and even physical assaults amid political
rhetoric blaming China for the pandemic from President Donald Trump and others.
The House measure, a nonbinding resolution, does not require the Senate to pass it, nor does it require the
president's signature.
According to Ucker's personnel file, he has taught at the university since 1996. A letter sent in August states
Ucker was offered an adjunct position in the College of Engineering and Applied Science effective Aug. 24
through Dec. 12, and compensated $3,600 for the semester.
The letter states three requirements Ucker is expected to fulfill: to hold two office hours per week; not to miss
any classes; and to ""do a good job teaching and taking care of the students.""

"Asian American youths angry, sad, fearful over surge in racist behavior","Mojadad, Ida",Others,2020-09-20,"Caleb Lee wishes he was surprised to hear that someone spit on an Asian American friend biking in Golden Gate
Park recently. A white woman told his friend, then 16 years old, to go back to China and called her a slur,
according to Lee.
Another friend was also told to go back to China by a classmate, before schools shut down, and called the same
slur.
""I was more angry and pissed off at the fact that the world just doesn't care and disregards this hate toward
us,"" said Lee, a 16-year-old junior at San Francisco's Urban School. ""It's sort of just become a harsh reality that
so many [Asian American Pacific Islander] individuals have been dealing with racism and hate in the form of
physical and verbal harassment.""
Caleb's words echoed some of the despair felt by Asian American youth surveyed this year by Stop AAPI Hate, a
reporting center launched by Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council (A3PCON), Chinese for Affirmative Action,
and San Francisco State University's Asian American Studies Department. The group has tracked more than
2,600 incidents of racial animus since mid-March, when much of the country went into a shel-ter-in-place to
curb coronavirus.
California accounts for 1,135 of those incidents, while 258 occurred in San Francisco as of Thursday. That's
shockingly high compared to 108 in Los Angeles, 54 in San Jose, 50 in Oakland, 28 in San Diego, and 20 in Sacramento.
Lee and a few other Urban School students worked on a nationwide effort by Stop AAPI Hate to track impact on
youth, culminating in the report ""They Blamed Me Because I Am Asian"" released on Thursday.
Seventy-seven percent of nearly 1,000 youth surveyed expressed anger over the spate of racism, 60 percent
said they were disappointed, and 46 percent expressed sadness or depression. Twenty-three percent said they
were scared.
They received 341 reports from youth nationally over an 18-week period, with 81 percent reporting bullying or
verbal harassment. Twenty-four percent said they faced shunning and social isolation while 8 percent reported
physical assaults.
Nearly 17 percent said they were harassed at school and online, respectively, and 14 percent were harassed in
public parks. Adults were present in 48 percent of the cases but bystanders intervened only 10 percent of the
time. Forty-one percent of incidents were perpetrated by youth, the rest by adults.
Nearly 60 percent of verbal harassment involved blaming Chinese people for the COVID-19 pandemic either as
being infected or as the source, while nearly 26 percent related to dietary habits, like shaming Asian Americans
for supposedly eating bats or dogs. One 17-year-old reported that a white man online told him his insides were
full of bats and to die by suicide for being a ""dirty f________dog-eater.""
""Historically, we've seen [upticks in racism] in pandemics, war and economic downturn,"" said Russell Jeung, a
San Francisco State professor who helped start Stop AAPI hate. ""We have all three. You think San Francisco is
this progressive, liberal town but again, I think, COVID fears and political rhetoric has really screwed up a lot of
anger.""
San Francisco has double the number of physical assaults compared to nationwide, according to Jeung. Density
may explain the concentration, even in places like The City and New York, where overtly welcoming attitudes of
immigrants are expressed.
But ultimately, Jeung said political rhetoric is to blame. President Donald Trump has repeatedly targeted China
for the virus and used epithets like ""Chinese virus"" and ""kung flu"" picked up by right-wing media. He has also
heightened tensions between the two countries, leading to a Cold War-like state of relations that ripples to
individual behavior.
""I just find it very debasing and dehumanizing that others can treat people that way,"" said Jeung, whose wife
was deliberately coughed on by a man in Oakland. ""People are wanting to share their stories and wanting it to
stop from happening. By having that collective voice, we're pushing for more bystander intervention.""
Jeung said that on an individual level, witnesses should attend to the targeted person to make sure they are
safe and to show social support, though he doesn't recommend engagement. Should that not immediately
transpire, people being targeted should call out and ask for assistance or approach someone nearby and express
their concern.
On a larger level, anti-racism training for teachers and administrators while implementing ethnic studies is part
of the answer. Grassroots community workshops and signage in stores help foster an anti-racist culture, too.
Lee said the long-term goal is to change the narrative of Asian Americans as silent, complacent model minorities
who blend into white America. Because the social fallout from the pandemic has proven the ""very false and very
harmful stereotype"" internalized in AAPI minds, too.
In the meantime, they hope workshops and preparing teachers will prevent aggression when the campus is
open again.
""There's a slight amount of fear and worry in the back of our mind that when we return we might receive
hate or racist comments,"" Lee said. ""But more than that, we have hope for this. By spreading awareness, it
will eventually reduce the hate because people might understand what they hadn't before. COVID-19 is not
going to be the last time.""

Reports show rising racism against Asian-American youths,None,Others,2020-09-18,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- Asian Americans are experiencing increased racism amid the COVID-19
pandemic, according to two reports released Thursday by Los Angeles-based Stop AAPI (Asian American and
Pacific Islander) Hate Reporting Center.
The first report ""They Blamed Me Because I Am Asian,"" written by 87 high school interns from the center's
Youth Campaign, analyzed 990 interviews with AAPI youths this summer to explore how young people are
coping with rising racism.
It showed that 77 percent of Asian American youths expressed anger over the current anti-Asian hate in the
United States, and 60 percent were disappointed at racism.
Incidents of harassment focused on blaming China and Chinese people as the source of the virus and mocking
Chinese dietary habits, it said.
The second report, written by a group of experts, analyzed 341 incidents of anti-Asian discrimination involving
youths reported to the center from March 19 to July 22, including 24 physical assaults.
It showed that in 56 percent of the incidents, perpetrators employed anti-Chinese hate speech, and that even
though adults were present in almost half of the incidents, bystanders intervened in only 10 percent of the
cases.

In the time of Zoom,"Roberts, Dmae",Others,2020-09-07,"MY TURN
Before the pandemic caused shutdowns, sheltering in place, and social distancing, I had never heard of Zoom, a
videoconferencing application that apparently many professionals in the world were already using.
Now I spend several hours a week and sometimes meet daily with people on Zoom. At first, it was novel and fun
as I learned how it differed from Skype, FaceTime, and Google Hangouts. Events I once attended or produced in
person, such as moderating panels for organizations or theater shows, suddenly were possible to conduct with
between 10 and 100 people virtually.
It's different talking to people primarily through my computer screen. I prepare for these meetings and events
in my home office by putting on makeup, making sure there's decent lighting, and wearing a top I hadn't
previously worn on a chat. Then I hit ""start"" much like one would for a live television show. It took some time to
stop looking at myself to check my posture or framing on-screen. After a while, I couldn't stand looking at the
boxes in the groupings that feel much like ""The Brady Bunch"" or ""Hollywood Squares"" - now I simply ignore it.
The first Zoom event I moderated was held in May. It was an affinity group conversation with about 25 Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI). It was for Oregon Humanities and the topic was anti-AAPI COVID-19
racism. We commented about how emotional it was for us to be able to gather this way to talk. I still have
similar feelings when I meet with friends and colleagues whom I haven't seen in person for a long time. I
learned to interview guests on my radio program via Skype or FaceTime long ago. It's not the same as meeting
in person. It never can be. But it is possible to connect meaningfully when I meet with people using Zoom.
Occasionally when I'm ""Zoomed out,"" I ask if a good old-fashioned phone call is possible, which is sometimes
more intimate and personal to me than Zoom. This type of communication allows me to walk around without
being stuck in front of a monitor with people watching. It also allows me to fiddle around with un-done
busywork around the house.
Since having to stay at home, I realized my anxiety and work stress were reduced. For 30 years, I've performed
most of my work within my home office, but I have also done a lot of public speaking and recorded field
interviews in public for radio documentaries and my local arts show, Stage & Studio, on KBOO. I used to look
forward to a lunch meeting - or a theatre rehearsal or stage play - that would get me out of the house. But until
life changed so dramatically for all of us, I didn't grasp how much time and energy it took to be able to
participate in these public engagements.
I've learned through the years that I'm both an introvert and an extrovert - an omnivert, if you will. Yes, I
attend parties or get on a stage to perform, but it's not natural for me. I have to gear up for public events. And
at times I experience mild panic attacks and anxiety about putting myself in the spotlight. ""Busy weeks"" used to
be typical for me. Looking back, I think I got used to feeling tired. I wonder now if I can ever go back to that old
schedule of constant multi-tasking and travel from place to place for my multiple jobs.
Nowadays, on the infrequent occasion when I actually go to a store or accompany my husband on an errand, I
look at everyone as a potential virus carrier. It saddens me to not be able to chit-chat with people, but at the
same time, I'm relieved I don't have to expend energy gearing up for in-person interactions or battling my
unease with public speaking.
I've always been an anxious person and prone to worry. I think it's something I inherited from my mother and
from an insecure childhood. Not having to deal with anxiety on a near-daily basis has been better for my health.
I sleep better, have time to exercise every day, and my life is more simple. This is a profound realization for me
- and an indicator that I may not return fully to what I'd been doing. Maybe this is the way I should have always
lived.
When a vaccine is finally tested, approved, and distributed to the public, and we one day receive the ""all clear""
(that is the hope), we'll emerge profoundly changed. I cannot go back to the way I worked or the feelings of
angst and exhaustion I used to tolerate. I suspect this may be true for others.
But for now, virtual conferencing and staying mostly at home seem to be the way things are in this time of
Zoom.

Asian Americans fighting hate crimes plus coronavirus at the same time,None,Others,2020-07-08,"As the coronavirus first reported in China now ravages the U.S., Asian Americans are continuing to wrestle with a second epidemic: hate. Hundreds of attacks on Asian people
have been reported, with few signs of decline.
Asian Americans in California reported 832 incidents of discrimination and harassment in the last three months, according to the new data collected by ""Stop Asian American
Pacific Islander Hate,"" the leading aggregator of incidents against Asian Americans during the pandemic.
The incidents included 81 assaults and 64 potential civil rights violations.
The new report released on Wednesday by Stop AAPI Hate shows that incidents of racism and discrimination are not isolated to any particular area but are a statewide problem
in California as Asian Americans have reported incidents in 34 counties so far in the most populous state of the United States, adding that incidents are reportedly taking place
in California in retail stores, in the workplace and online.
""Anti-Asian American harassment has also been further stoked by President Trump's repeated use of the term 'Kung Flu' in recent rallies, and as recently as last night,
comments on Twitter scapegoating China for the United States' devastating failure to control the coronavirus,"" said the group in a statement.
They noted that discrimination and harassment of Asian Americans in California has drawn national attention recently after a series of videos in Torrance, California featured a
woman using graphic racist language against Asian Americans.
""The viral video of racism in Torrance is one example of hundreds. It's the tip of the iceberg of anti-Asian American hate and discrimination,"" said Russell Jeung, chair and
professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University. ""Without government accountability, we risk COVID-related racism against Asian Americans becoming
deeply entrenched, ultimately impacting the lives of millions of people in California and around the country.""
""Racist demagoguery matched with anti-immigrant policies have always been used to deny Asian Americans full social and political rights,"" said Cynthia Choi, co-executive
director of Chinese for Affirmative Action.
""In California, we have to do more than condemn racist rhetoric – we must take bold action today to address attacks whether they happen in grocery stores, in the workplace or
in the schoolyard,"" Choi added.
Stop AAPI Hate sent a letter to California governor Gavin Newsom Tuesday night to recommend the establishment of a Racial Bias Strike Team comprised of key state agencies
and departments to oversee workplace and employment discrimination, provide mental health services to vulnerable communities, and offer support to local Asian American-
serving organizations.
Meanwhile, Asian Americans in New York have been helping themselves confronted with the increase of targeted hate crimes by equipped themselves with GoPros and guns.
When Eddie Song leaves his Manhattan home, it can feel like heading into battle. The Korean American startup founder and avid rider dons his armored motorcycle jacket,
motorcycle gloves, a skull face mask and a GoPro camera.
""The GoPro is on all the time whenever I leave the house now. Basically it's a rolling camera,"" Song said. ""With the combination of looking intimidating and having the camera –
if they pick a fight with me, they know I'm prepared.""
During the pandemic, an online hate reporting center has received nearly 1,500 reports of racist abuse against Asians nationwide since it launched March 19. Stay-at-home
orders mean in-person run-ins are down somewhat but vandalism of Asian-owned homes and businesses is up, according to the advocacy groups running the portal.
It's difficult to predict whether incidents will dramatically drop once society goes back to ""normal,"" Levin, a former NYPD officer, said, noting that the pandemic is
unprecedented.
""Generally, when there's a catalytic event, hate crimes tend to decline and have a bit of a half-life,"" he said. ""But that presupposes a singular catalytic event as opposed to a
rolling one.""

Asian Americans use social media to fight racism,"Zhu, Lia",Others,2020-07-23,"Asian Americans have started social media campaigns to combat the rise in racism they have faced amid the
coronavirus pandemic.
In a video released on Tuesday on several social media platforms, a group of Asians in face masks detailed the
discrimination, harassment and racism they have experienced - such as being told to ""go back to China"" or
having people cough at them or spit in their direction.
Pulling off their masks, they reveal their occupations as firefighter, nurse, doctor, delivery woman, bus driver
and other roles considered essential in the pandemic. The minute-long video is titled Fight the Virus. Fight the
Bias - the message they declare at its end.
The video, produced by the Advertising Council, a nonprofit organization that makes public service
announcements, and Emmy Award-winning writer Alan Yang, is aimed at building a sense of humanity and
breaking the silence around the hatred impacting the Asian-American community.
""Amid this pandemic and the stresses associated, nobody should have to also endure the added layer of fear
that comes from this surge in racial violence and harassment,"" said Advertising Council President and CEO Lisa
Sherman. She said she hoped the video would inspire US citizens to rethink their biases and help end the wave
of racism facing Asian Americans. Reports by many civil rights organizations show that Asian communities across the US are enduring increasing
harassment and assaults since the novel coronavirus began to spread in the country.
The Anti-Defamation League recently compiled a list of coronavirus-related anti-Asian incidents from January to
June, including people being physically assaulted, properties being vandalized, and an online meeting disrupted
by anti-Asian slurs in the chat function.
Stop AAPI Hate, a coronavirus-related racism-reporting platform, recorded more than 2,000 incidents across the
country in three months.
Statements by US President Donald Trump and his allies referring to COVID-19 as the ""Chinese virus"" or the
""kung flu"" have fueled xenophobia and bigotry toward people of Chinese descent and other Asian Americans,
said Russell Jeung, chair and professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University.
""President Trump's insistent use of the term 'Chinese virus' creates an implicit association that the virus is
Chinese, and that the Chinese have the virus,"" Jeung said.
Political scapegoat
Subsequently, others have blamed Chinese and Asians in the US for being the source of the disease, said Jeung,
who compiled the Stop AAPI Hate data. He noted that when Trump began using the terms, incidents of bias
against Asian Americans jumped.
""It's clear that President Trump is scapegoating China for the pandemic. He does so to deflect responsibility for
his poor handling of this public health crisis, and more recently to avoid dealing with 'Black Lives Matter' and
America's racial injustices,"" said Jeung. ""By blaming China, he seeks to create an outside enemy that his
political base could be angry with.""
A survey by the Pew Research Center showed that 4 in 10 US adults said that it had become more common for
people to express racist views toward Asians since the pandemic began.
About a quarter of the Asian-American respondents said they feared someone might threaten or physically
attack them, a higher percentage than for any other group.
The Trump administration has been criticized for doing little about the rise in anti-Asian hate amid the pandemic,
in comparison with actions taken by previous administrations in similar situations such as the SARS outbreak
and the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
After the 9/11 attacks, then president George W. Bush, a Republican, and the attorney general and FBI director
immediately issued statements that hate crimes and discrimination against Arab, Muslim, Sikh and South Asian
Americans would not be tolerated.

Experts call on nations to curb racism,Cui Jia,Others,2020-07-06,"In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries should curb the alarming rise in xenophobic incidents and hate speech directed at groups based solely on their race, ethnicity or
nationality because such incidents threaten the solidarity needed to fight the disease, international human rights experts said in an online seminar on Friday.
More than a dozen human rights experts from around the world shared their views at the seminar, which was titled ""Addressing Contemporary Forms of Racism: Challenges
Posed by the Pandemic and the National Responses"".
The seminar was hosted by the Human Rights Center of Central South University, the Wuhan University Institute of International Law and the Cross Cultural Human Rights
Centre at Vrije University Amsterdam.
""People who are perceived or known to be of Chinese or other East Asian descent have been subject to racist and xenophobic attacks related to the virus. Reports received
indicate that racially motivated violence and other incidents against people of Asian descent have reached an alarming level in some countries,"" said E. Tendayi Achiume, the
United Nations special rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, in a statement.
Due to time zone differences, her statement was delivered by Kellie-Shandra Ognimba, from the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.
Achiume said Asian-Americans have been subject to such attacks since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The attacks have ranged from physical assaults, vandalism and
verbal harassment to denial of access to services and public spaces. Women have reported being harassed more than twice as often as men.
The situation is partly caused by irresponsible and discriminatory remarks by some public figures, she said.
""It's dismaying to witness state officials adopting alternative names for COVID-19 instead of using the internationally recognized name of the virus. These officials have adopted
names with geographic references, typically referring to its emergence in China. This sort of calculated use of a geographic-based name for this virus is rooted in and fosters
racism and xenophobia,"" she said.
Naming the virus with geographic references may not constitute as hate speech itself, but it will trigger hate speech, said Sun Shiyan, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences' Institute of International Law.
During the pandemic, COVID-19-related racist hate speech has been rampant in various countries, especially on social media. Such speech not only affects many ethnic groups
but also may threaten international solidarity in efforts to respond to the health crisis, Sun said.
Meanwhile, the Chinese community in the Netherlands has moved from indirectly challenging racist comments to tackling them head on, especially during the outbreak. The
assertiveness of the younger generation has been significant, said Tom Zwart, director of the Amsterdam university's Cross Cultural Human Rights Centre.
On Feb 6, a so-called corona song was broadcast by a radio station in the Netherlands. In the song, a number of crude remarks were made about Chinese people and Chinese
restaurants.
About 60,000 people of Asian origin objected to the song by formally reporting it as a crime to the police. The public prosecutor then announced that it would investigate if the
singer and songwriter had committed the crime of offending a group of people on the basis of race.
On June 2, the prosecutor announced that it had decided not to pursue the case. The decision sparked outrage in the Chinese community, Zwart said.
He added that last week, community representatives opted to challenge the prosecutor's decision, further proof that it is ready to confront the issue in ""a very direct way"".

Divided we fall,"YASA, DILVIN",Others,2020-07-19,"From being told you’re “too pretty to be Aboriginal” to being blamed for COVID-19, three women on the
receiving end of racial abuse share their experiences with Dilvin Yasa.
It’s the land of mateship and fair go, but Australian academics have been documenting some disturbing factors
where minority groups are concerned.
According to the University of Western Sydney’s Challenging Racism Project, one in three people experienced
racism in the workplace in 2015-16, while a 2013 study published in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence found
seven in 10 students experienced or observed racism during their childhood.
Professor Tim Soutphommasane, Australia’s race discrimination commissioner from 2013 to 2018 and the author
of On Hate, says that while we’re seeing a global anti-racism moment, with people across the world talking and
thinking about racism with a new level of seriousness, racism is on the rise on home ground. “Bodies such as
the Australian Human Rights Commission and some state anti-discrimination bodies have received a higher
number of complaints about racial discrimination,” he explains. “There has been a spike in racial hostility
directed at people from Asian backgrounds in particular.”
This isn’t a matter of “hurt feelings”, or that people who are targets of racial taunts are delicate or sensitive, Soutphommasane adds.
“There’s a large amount of research that shows the psychological, even physiological, effects of racism on
people’s wellbeing; it can diminish a person and sap them of their dignity.
People who aren’t from minority backgrounds don’t always understand the damage it can cause.” Lee Lin Chin
was the first person I idolised, because of everything she represented. With her media career, quirky wardrobe
and short hair, not only was she the antithesis of the ‘typical’ Asian mould of that ladylike woman with the long,
glossy hair, but she was visible to mainstream Australia at a time when minority groups were invisible on screen.
“When you’re Asian, there are all these expectations you’ll be good with numbers or work in medicin. But I was
passionate about drama and the arts. Square peg, round hole.
I grew up in an environment where it wasn’t unusual to have people scream ‘Go back to your own country’ as
you’re going about your business.
That’s sad in itself but one of the things that’s been concerning me lately is the fetishisation of Asian women.
I’ve been stalked on trains by masturbating men and once I was followed home by a guy who kept asking, ‘Are
you an accountant? Do you work in finance?’ It happens in the workplace, too; earlier in my career, I remember
one of my company directors picking me up and swinging me around as he told me how much he loves Asian
women. It’s a strange fixation that’s rooted in male dominance and white supremacy.
The COVID-19 era has brought to light an overt form of racism I haven’t experienced for a long time. Recently I
was standing in line at Aldi with my four-year-old son and, even though I was following social-distancing
guidelines, the woman in front turned around and spat, ‘Maintain social distancing because you are Asian.’
I told her that I was born here and that I didn’t personally cause the virus, but it fell on deaf ears. I understand
it’s a time of fear for everyone but that incident has really shaken me. I’ve been anxious about going out in
public and I ask myself, ‘Do people see me, or do they see “generic Asian spreading disease”?’ It’s a terrible way
to live.
I don’t think Australia is more racist than other countries but I think we believe we’re a lot more tolerant than
we really are. This is a country filled with citizens who think nothing of saying, ‘Oh, you speak really good
English’ to someone with a broad Aussie accent. And ‘I don’t normally like Asians but you’re pretty nice’, and
then laughing it off as some kind of joke. As a stand-up comedian [Ngo is a member of the Tight 5 Comedy
group], I can tell you with some experience that ‘casual racism’ is no laughing matter.”
“MOST OF THE RACISM I’VE EXPERIENCED HAS COME FROM OTHER RECENT ARRIVALS“ Maie Sufan, a “40-
something” engineer and support relations co-ordinator for Islamic Relief Australia, moved to Australia from her
native Syria in 2006.
“When I moved to Australia for love, I left behind a very successful life as an engineer and lecturer. It was hard
to leave my country but even though I wasn’t sure about how different things would be culturally in Australia, I
wasn’t too worried. I knew it to be a multicultural nation and Australians have a reputation overseas for being
friendly and inclusive. I felt welcomed as soon as I landed.
When you wear a headscarf you get used to people openly staring, but while I’ve had my share of ‘f...ing Muslim’
comments in the streets, I’ve only ever had two major incidents where the behaviour has been extreme.
The first time was not long after I arrived, when a woman in her 50s followed me around a shopping centre
screaming in my face about why I was in ‘her country’. She yelled, ‘We have a stupid government letting stupid
Muslims like you into our country.’
She was aggressive and intimidating.
The second time was at the Royal Sydney Easter Show when I picked up an egg in the barn, not knowing this
was something I was not allowed to do, and a man nearby began screaming at me. He was annoyed about
the egg but made his argument about my religion, background and about people not understanding where
they belong.
Both times I held my ground and defended my right to be in Australia but these experiences are infuriating.
Yes, of course it’s their country but it’s my country, too. What’s more, I love this country by choice.
Over the years I’ve discovered that the people who think it’s okay to make hurtful comments are not
necessarily who you think they might be. Most of the racism I’ve experienced over the last 14 years has come
from those with different cultural backgrounds and other recent arrivals to this country.
By contrast, the majority of ‘typical’ Australians have been very friendly and accepting and I’ve made some
lovely friends. When the Lindt Cafe situation unfolded in 2014, people went out of their way to ensure I was
okay and that I remained safe. I think two major incidents and a handful of comments in 14 years isn’t
unreasonable.
The biggest problem with racism in our country is that the poison often trickles from the top down. It seems
as though if anyone wants to be successful in politics in Australia, they have to start spouting hate speech
about other cultures. These are our leaders and our role models, and if we’re learning how to treat our fellow
Australians from them, we’re going to be in big trouble moving forward.” “Born to a proud Wadjanbarra Yidinji
and Jirrbal mother and an African- American father, I often refer to myself as ‘double black’. It took me years
to claim that identity because so much of my childhood was spent figuring out who I was.
When we moved to the States, I was told I couldn’t identify as black because I had ‘lighter skin and good
hair’. To them, I was mixed. When we moved back to Australia, when I was 10, it was just as strange. I didn’t
grow up on country and didn’t look like my extended family. As a kid I didn’t feel Aboriginal enough and I
grew up confused about what being black even meant.
I was 11 when I first heard the words ‘You’re too pretty to be Aboriginal’, and that’s the moment I realised
being Aboriginal was considered dirty, like no good can come of it. Over the years, there have been others:
‘You’re not like the rest’, ‘You’re too articulate’ and ‘You could pass yourself off as Brazilian – that’s much
better.’
There is this view that I should be happy by my proximity to whiteness, as though assimilation is something
I’m trying desperately to achieve, but people don’t realise comments like that perpetuate genocide on my
culture. In efforts to explore my Aboriginality and beauty I created the documentary Too Pretty to Be
Aboriginal, which screened in 2019 on NITV Our Stories.
When there’s hate bubbling up around you, there’s also a level of internal racism you experience. I was raised
with messages like, ‘You’re black so you have to work twice as hard.’ And, ‘Don’t behave in a way that can be
deemed as too urban or show too much attitude lest you’re labelled aggressive.’ You learn to present yourself
in a way that’s socially acceptable for the masses but it’s at the cost of your identity.
When I started my magazine, Ascension, I wanted it to be a one-stop shop for women of colour but since the
Black Lives Matter protests began, I’ve noticed a significant shift in the demographic of my readership.
For the first time ever, people from all backgrounds are coming to us, eager to embrace diversity. And while
one part of me feels like shouting, ‘Yes! This is the opportunity we’ve been waiting for’, another part can’t
help wondering if we’re just a trend. Is it Black Lives Matter today and then something else tomorrow? I’m
opting to remain positive.
Not to take away support from America – I’m an African-American woman; my people need it – but
Australia needs to acknowledge its own black history first and stop sweeping it under the carpet. It’s
hypocritical to say “black lives matter” but then deny ours.
I don’t believe the government will ever come to the table to rectify the atrocities against my people.
I truly believe that if Australians can channel the compassion and love of humanity displayed during the
bushfires and extend it to First Nations people, we could start a revolution.
The solution starts with us.” • If you experience racial discrimination you can lodge a complaint with the
Australian Human Rights Commission at humanrights.gov.au/complaints.

Teen charged in London over racially aggravated attack on S'porean,"Ng, Keng Gene",Others,2020-07-20,"A 15-year-old boy has been charged by the London Metropolitan Police over his alleged involvement in a racially
aggravated assault on Singaporean student Jonathan Mok in London.
A police spokesman said the boy was charged with wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm without intent
and will appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court on Aug 10.
The police added that a 16-year-old boy who was arrested on March 4 in connection with the case has been
released with no further action taken against him.
On March 3, Mr Mok, 23, opened up on Facebook about the attack, which took place in Oxford Street near the
London Underground's Tottenham Court Road train station.
The University College London law student said he heard a group of young people say ""coronavirus"" as he
walked past them at about 9.15pm on Feb 24.
When he turned to face the group, he was punched in the face, with one of the suspects saying ""I don't want
your coronavirus in my country"" before the group fled.
The incident resulted in Mr Mok having to go for facial surgery, reported Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao.
On March 4, the Singapore High Commission in London said on Facebook that it was ""deeply disturbed"" by the
attack and recognised its ""broader implications"", given the large Singaporean community in Britain.
It also promised to ensure that the London Metropolitan Police ""follow through with their investigation with the
utmost priority"".

Survey confirms discrimination against Asian Americans amid coronavirus pandemic
""(We) do not believe that the assault reflects the majority view of the British people in particular towards
Singapore, given the close and special relationship between the UK and Singapore,"" the High Commission
added.
British High Commissioner in Singapore Kara Owen said in a tweet on March 3 that she was ""shocked and
saddened by the attack"" and wished Mr Mok a speedy recovery.
Mr Mok said in his Facebook post: ""Why should anyone, simply because of the colour of their skin, be subjected
to abuse, in any form, verbal or physical? Why should I keep quiet when someone makes a racist remark
towards me?
""Racism is not stupidity - racism is hate. Racists constantly find excuses to expound their hatred - and in this
current backdrop of the coronavirus, they've found yet another excuse.""

Asian Americans report more than 800 hate incidents in California during COVID-19 pandemic,None,Others,2020-07-03,"LOS ANGELES, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Asian Americans in California have self-reported 832 incidents of discrimination and harassment in the last three months, according to the new
data collected by a coalition of Asian American groups.
Stop Asian American Pacific Islander Hate, the leading aggregator of incidents against Asian Americans during the pandemic, released the findings during a Wednesday virtual
conference. The Stop AAPI Hate reporting center was founded by the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, Chinese for Affirmative Action and San Francisco State
University's Asian American Studies Department.
The incidents included 81 assaults and 64 potential civil rights violations.
The new report shows that incidents of racism and discrimination are not isolated to any particular area but are a statewide problem in California as Asian Americans have
reported incidents in 34 counties so far in the most populous state of the United States, adding that incidents are reportedly taking place in California in retail stores, in the
workplace and online.
""Anti-Asian American harassment has also been further stoked by President Trump's repeated use of the term 'Kung Flu' in recent rallies, and as recently as last night,
comments on Twitter scapegoating China for the United States' devastating failure to control the coronavirus,"" said the groups in a statement.
They noted that discrimination and harassment of Asian Americans in California has drawn national attention recently after a series of videos in Torrance, California featured a
woman using graphic racist language against Asian Americans.
""The viral video of racism in Torrance is one example of hundreds. It's the tip of the iceberg of anti-Asian American hate and discrimination,"" said Russell Jeung, Chair and
Professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University. ""Without government accountability, we risk COVID-related racism against Asian Americans becoming
deeply entrenched, ultimately impacting the lives of millions of people in California and around the country.""
""Racist demagoguery matched with anti-immigrant policies have always been used to deny Asian Americans full social and political rights,"" said Cynthia Choi, co-executive
director of Chinese for Affirmative Action.
""In California, we have to do more than condemn racist rhetoric - we must take bold action today to address attacks whether they happen in grocery stores, in the workplace or
in the schoolyard,"" Choi added.
Stop AAPI Hate sent a letter to California governor Gavin Newsom Tuesday night to recommend the establishment of a Racial Bias Strike Team comprised of key state agencies
and departments to oversee workplace and employment discrimination, provide mental health services to vulnerable communities, and offer support to local Asian American-serving organizations.

Residents share racial experiences in Hanover area,"Veloso, Mariana",Others,2020-07-19,"Like all parents, Ystein Mitchell worries for the safety of his child.
But as a Black man, he also has to worry whether his child will face racism for being biracial.
""It's sad that I have to tell my kid about racism and prejudiced people,"" Mitchell, 27, said.
Mitchell, an entrepreneur and brand owner, has a 5-year-old son and after a recent interaction with a neighbor
that his son witnessed, he had to tell him about racism.
""I had to explain to him that there's some people that may not like him, me or him, just solely because of our
skin color, or of our racial background or our religion. ... So, I explained to him ... not everybody's gonna like
you for who you are, some people are not gonna like the way you look but that doesn't matter.
""It doesn't change who you are, those people are the problem, not you.""
Mitchell described the experience as ""disheartening.""
""I'm more concerned about when he goes back to school, how he's going to be towards children that are
Caucasian because I don't want him thinking, which is what I told him, ... that all white people are bad, just
certain types of people that choose to live a racist and prejudiced life,"" the McSherrystown resident said.
Mitchell said this is especially important being that his son's mother and her family are white.
As Black Lives Matter protests have swept the nation in the recent months, many claim that racist issues don't
exist in small rural communities like Hanover and Gettysburg.
In response, some in these communities have stood up to unmask what life for a person of color in this area is
really like.
Latrecia Thomas, of Harrisburg, has Black sons, and she said that the Black Lives Matter movement occurring
today will hopefully pave the way for her children.
""Honestly, I hope that they don't have to scream out Black Lives Matter when they get older,"" the 29-year-old
said. ""That me saying it now ... and us working on it now, that this whole racial adversity is, for the most part,
gone by the time our children get older, so that they can live free and feel free.""
Black Lives Matter Protests: 'I want to be treated like a human'
To Thomas, Black Lives Matter has a very simple meaning.
""The gist ... is: 'Hi, we're here. I'm a person. I want to be treated like a human, I respect you, you respect me,'""
Thomas said.
The movement for her means community and a platform for Black people to share their grievances.
""It makes it all inclusive for all of us Black people to say your life does matter ... regardless of what your
circumstances are and regardless of what you've done. You don't deserve to be treated worse than anyone
else,"" Thomas said.
She attended recent protests in Harrisburg and Baltimore and said that she was able to have some very
enlightening conversations with people because of it.
""That's probably my favorite way to protest, especially if someone's open to that conversation because we have
to educate, we have to say like 'This is what I'm feeling and maybe you don't understand that because you
haven't taken the time to sit down and see that I had this real emotion behind that,'"" Thomas said.
She said she was happy to hear there were similar protests in Hanover, where she grew up.
Annie Henry, 24, was one of the organizers of the Black Lives Matter protest in Hanover on Sunday, May 31.
Now, in the COVID-19 pandemic, Asian Americans like herself have experienced discrimination from those
blaming the Asian community for the virus. Henry said that personal experience of being fearful of others
making racist remarks gave her a glimpse at what Black people deal with every day.
She believes that it's important for people to know what kind of action they can take regarding these national
issues.
""It is a privilege to not have to be involved in politics, a privilege that I could have if I chose not to, but I think
it's important that we use the privileges we do have to help those who might not. It shouldn't be left up to the
people who are oppressed to fix the systems that oppress them,"" Henry said.
She admitted she did have some reservations about organizing the protest in Hanover.
""If you look at the demographics of (Hanover), statistically, it is a very white town, and when there's a
homogeneous population, it's sometimes difficult to understand other experiences and other perspectives,""
Henry said.
""When we don't see diversity, when we don't have diverse thoughts, then the way that our town functions is
going to be from the white perspective. And that's not that people are being wrong, but it's understanding
that, and it's acknowledging that.""
Despite these reservations, ""I'm very happy we were able to do it peacefully and still impactfully.""
Henry also helped with the protest on Saturday, June 6, which was organized by the same person who
organized various recent protests in Gettysburg and Hanover, Matthew Anselmi.
Anselmi, of Gettysburg, is originally from Detroit where he said he lived in a poverty-stricken neighborhoods
with many Black families.
He said that from what he's seen on Facebook, many people think that the protests are just about George
Floyd's death and charging the officers involved, but it's about much more.
""Granted, this most recent slaying by the police is what has ignited worldwide protests, but it's just one
instance that speaks to hundreds of years of injustices and I think it's really important to get this message
out to rural America,"" the 31-year-old said.
He said that since organizing the protests, he and his family have received sexual assault and death threats
mostly on Facebook. While he said they have not filed any reports with police, he has provided police with
names of those that have threatened him and his family.
""Initially it was mind blowing, but it makes total sense. We're making an entire ideology uncomfortable, it's to
be expected. There's a lot of news on the national level that has painted all protesters as violent thugs so
people have been conditioned to respond a certain way, we are here to break these cycles,"" he said through
Facebook messenger.
Tori Gilbert, 24, of Gettysburg, said that when she saw the protest downtown she almost cried.
""Because I was like this is beautiful, I'm so glad to see so many people support it in this town because there
is also a lot of racism in this town."" she said.
Is there racism in small towns like Hanover, Gettysburg?
Thomas attended South Western High School in the Hanover area, and although she said she got a great
education, it was also the first place she experienced racism.
She described an instance where she and two of her friends, the only Black cheerleaders at the school, were
walking to a Wendy's when a man with a Confederate flag on the back of his truck drove by and called them
the ""n"" word.
""I was extremely taken aback because it was the first time I've ever had that happen to me. (My friend) had
been there longer than me and so had our other friends. They started telling me how they were used to
people doing it. I did go and report that to the principal and let them know, nothing was done about it,""
Thomas said.
She eventually saw the man again at a school dance.
""That's really where I learned to start reading more and start understanding how to say things to people
more because it wasn't being paid attention to, no one cared that people were calling us names and making
us not feel like we belonged,"" Thomas said.
Thomas not only experienced racism at school, but also in the community. She said that people would tell her
mother, an immigrant from Ghana who spoke with an accent, to ""go back to Africa,"" that her white friends'
parents wouldn't let her and her siblings play with them at their homes, and that managers at work would
often treat her differently than her white co-workers.
Thomas said that the racism she experienced in Hanover was why she left the area, ""because I just didn't
want to have to keep going through that as an adult.""
Mitchell is also the child of an immigrant, but his family came to the United States from St. Lucia, an island
in the Caribbean. He was born in Maryland, near the D.C., Maryland, Virginia triangle, where he said
there's a lot of diversity and because of that he never experienced racism or prejudice. Then he moved to
Pennsylvania.
""I started to see people with Confederate flags, really proud of waving Confederate flags and disrespecting
people or saying things (that are prejudiced). ... It seems like up here in Pennsylvania they're very proud
of that, some people are very proud of being ignorant,"" Mitchell said.
He also attended South Western, where he said he experienced racism.
Anselmi, a white man who grew up in a very diverse community, was shocked at the racism that he
witnessed once he moved to Hanover.
""When I first moved here, I remember being at the south Hanover Walmart and being in line and I was
caught in between two older white men, and they were just so openly using the 'n' word and just talking
(about Black people) like they are straight animals that need to be put down ... It completely blew my
mind that these people, not knowing who I am, were so comfortable with their racism."" Anselmi said.
Racism on social media
Though many people use platforms like Facebook to share information about the protests and the
movements, much of those posts are followed by backlash.
While he was organizing the Hanover protest, Anselmi said rumors on social media were circulating about a
bus of Black people going from Baltimore to Hanover.
He said the attention that rumor gained appalled him.
""Then I see their reaction to the idea of a few Black people being sent up here in buses, and they are
terrified. It's like the reaction was like, we're being threatened with an invasion from a hostile foreign
country,""; Anselmi said.
This was his reaction to this rumor, the events of which never actually occurred on the day of the protest:
First: ""They have their own mess down there and I'm sure that not too many people have the time to come
up to Hanover.""
Second: ""They just got national news recognition for a very peaceful protest that policemen partook in.""
Third: ""We are protesting for Black lives so if there does end up being a couple of buses from people that
live in Baltimore coming to support our cause then hallelujah. You know what I mean, like this is who we're
fighting for.""
Thomas said she has witnessed individuals from Hanover who regularly post ""racist memes, racist ideology,
racist rhetoric.""
While Thomas said it's OK for people not to agree about Black Lives Matter, it all comes down to respect.
""When it starts to becoming that you're making fun of Black Lives Matter, you compare Black people to
the planet of the apes so calling us animals themselves and saying that we need to basically shut up,
and that it's not true and that we just want attention. That is incorrect. ... It's just not right,"" Thomas
said.
Gilbert has also seen posts online from people who don't believe races should mix or who don't think
white privilege exists. At the end of the day, she said it's important for everyone to be knowledgeable
about the Black Lives Matter movement.
""I feel like everyone needs to be aware that there is a lot of racism still going on,"" Gilbert said.
'If we continue this way with all this racial intensity, we will fail as America'
Though much unrest has led to the Black Lives Matter protests, the movement also hopes to make
change for a better future.
""I hope the protests bring about vigilance and that people are on the lookout for things that aren't right
and that they're willing to stand up and say, 'I see this. Even though it's uncomfortable, it's not right.
And as an American, I'm going to say that's not welcome here,'"" Thomas said.
Thomas and Anselmi both also said they would like to see legislation passed against racism both from
the community and police.
Henry said she believes preventing racial injustice begins with education followed by action.
""I think the first part of it is understanding where you play a part in the problem and where you can
help. ... Then also getting involved with donating to organizations that are doing things like helping elect
more diverse government officials and helping to advocate for marginalized groups,"" she said.
""I also think that events like (the protests) get people to think about what's happening and to hold
ourselves and the organizations and businesses and things we're a part of accountable.""
Mitchell just hopes change comes in time for his son to live in a better world.
""I just hope in his lifetime that maybe there's some type of change and some type of shift in the culture
and people realize that (racism and prejudice) it's so just not the right thing to do, it's very ignorant.
And we need to really get a grip on social matters,"" Mitchell said.
""I hope that everybody can live and coexist equally, regardless of skin color, religion or creed.""
Thomas said she wants these protests to help end the treatment of Blacks as ""second class citizens.""
""I think that if we continue this way with all this racial intensity, we will fail as America, we will fail
because it takes all of us to run this country it takes all of us to do what needs to be done, and we owe
it to our children, not just our Black children but white children as well,"" Thomas said.
Amanda Beard-White, of Penn Township, is the executive director of the Hanover Diversity Alliance,
which is currently working to form a Human Relations Commission in Hanover Borough, Penn Township,
West Manheim, Conewago Township and McSherrystown Borough.
The commission would be able to work with police if someone made a discrimination complaint. It would
then review those complaints and decide what action would be taken either on the local or the state
level.
They would also work to remove old discriminatory laws from the books. For example, Beard-White said Hanover still has a Sundown Law that doesn't allow people of color to be in the streets by a certain
time of the evening.
Although these laws are no longer enforceable, Beard-White said they are demeaning to the
communities of color in this area.

"Asians in US face racial bias amid outbreak, survey finds","Ghosh, Nirmal",Others,2020-07-02,"About four in 10 black American and Asian American adults surveyed say people have acted uncomfortably around them because of their race or ethnicity since the beginning of
the Covid-19 outbreak, according to a new Pew Research Centre survey.
Only 13 per cent of white adults say this has happened to them.
Asians have borne the brunt of racist reactions; about three in 10 Asian adults (31 per cent) say they have been subject to slurs or jokes because of their race or ethnicity since
the outbreak began, compared with 21 per cent of black adults, 15 per cent of Hispanic adults and 8 per cent of white adults.
The findings are not out of line with reports of incidents of discrimination against Asian Americans since the coronavirus outbreak first emerged in China and then spread in the
United States.
Against a background of intensifying pushback by the US against China, Beijing's actions - or lack of them - in the initial stages of the pandemic have become a domestic
political issue in the US, with President Donald Trump blaming China as he campaigns for re-election. The President has even used the term ""kung flu"" - widely considered
derogatory - twice, although the White House has said the term merely underlines the origin of the coronavirus.
Pew Research surveyed 9,654 American adults from June 4 to 10 for the study on personal experiences with racial and ethnic discrimination since the beginning of the
coronavirus outbreak, and opinions about whether racist views towards different groups have become more common.
Everyone who took part is a member of Pew Research's American Trends Panel, an online survey panel recruited through a national, random sampling of residential addresses.
The survey is weighted to be representative of the US' adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories.
However, as the survey included a total sample size of 278 Asian Americans, and English-speaking Asian Americans only, it may not be representative of the overall Asian
American population, Pew Research said.
Asian Americans, who account for 6 per cent of the US population, are the fastest growing major racial or ethnic group in the country. Hispanics make up 18 per cent of the
population overall, while Black Americans are 12 per cent,
The survey also found that a majority of Asian adults (58 per cent - more than black or Hispanic adults) say it is now more common for people to express racist or racially
insensitive views about people who are Asian than it was before the coronavirus outbreak.
31%
Proportion of Asian Americans who say they have been subject to slurs or jokes because of their race or ethnicity since the outbreak began - compared with 21 per cent of black
adults, 15 per cent of Hispanic adults and 8 per cent of white adults.
It also found 42 per cent of black Americans and 36 per cent of Asian Americans saying they worry a great deal or a fair amount that other people might be suspicious of them
because of their race or ethnicity if they wear a mask or face covering when in stores or other businesses.
In contrast, 23 per cent of Hispanics and just 5 per cent of white adults say they worry about this.
Black Americans had mixed experiences though, with many experiencing more support in the wake of the May 25 death of African American George Floyd while he was
restrained by a police officer, which ignited nationwide outrage across ethnic groups.

"China: Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian's Regular Press Conference on July 9, 2020",Francis (Pope),Others,2020-07-10,"China News Service: According to reports, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized China's political system and
epidemic response at a press conference on July 8. Do you have any comment?
Zhao Lijian: For quite some time Pompeo has been busy concocting fake news to vilify China and drive a wedge between
China and other countries. All this has laid bare his deep-seated Cold War mindset, zero-sum game mentality and
ideological prejudices.
Facts can speak for themselves, while lies repeated a thousand times are still lies. We advise this US politician to rectify
his mistakes and stop spreading the political virus to avoid become a laughing stock.
CCTV: A follow-up question. US Secretary of State Pompeo said in the same interview that ""Beijing claimed for months
that it reported the outbreak of the virus to the WHO. Now we know that's not true."" He also said, the CPC ""has an
enormous credibility problem"", that it ""chose to hide and obfuscate and deny basic truth"", and that it ""has to be held
accountable."" I wonder if you have any comment?
Zhao Lijian: The first thing I want to say is, Mr. Pompeo, stop talking about credibility, truth or accountability because we
are so fed up with your words.
Speaking of credibility, while promoting ""America first"" in recent years, the US has been habitually breaching its
international commitments and obligations and withdrawing from organizations and treaties. It is literally the biggest
""trouble maker"" in the world.
Speaking of the truth, I'd like to ask Mr. Pompeo: can US government tell people in America and around the world the truth behind the Fort Detrick biolab, the EVALI, and the US biolabs located all over the world?
Speaking of accountability, in less than six months, there have been over three million confirmed COVID-19 cases and
more than 130,000 death tolls in the US; the US government should indeed be held accountable for this.
With their own image and reputation hitting rock-bottom, I wonder why Mr. Pompeo and his like are so brazen to talk
about credibility, truth and accountability? We advise those US politicians heed the strong rejection from the international
community to the country's frequent pullback from various agreements and organizations.
After the COVID-19 broke out, China notified the WHO at the earliest time possible, and the timelines published by both
sides have listed all the facts that are mutually corroborated. Turning a blind eye to the internationally acknowledged
facts, Pompeo is so obsessed in fabricating lies and shifting the blame. His behaviors, instead of covering up the
incompetence of the US side to fight the pandemic, only reveal his nature of lying and cheating and some American
officials' hypocrisy, arrogance and ignorance.
Reuters: First question, out of concerns over China's national security law for Hong Kong, the Australian Prime Minister
today announced the decision to suspend the country's extradition agreement with Hong Kong and extend visas for Hong
Kong residents in Australia. Do you have any comment? Second, Global Times cited sources that China is considering
suing the German scholar Adrian Zenz and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Can you confirm this? Third question,
in his speech on Sunday, Pope Francis didn't talk about his concerns over freedom and human rights in Hong Kong which
he planned to speak of. Some say Pope Francis may have been under China's pressure. Has China asked the Vatican not
to talk about Hong Kong?
Zhao Lijian: On your first question, the Australian side's comments and measures are in serious violation of international
law and the basic norms governing international relations. They constitute gross interference in China's internal affairs,
and China doesn't accept it. We express strong condemnation and reserve the right to make further reaction, and
Australia should bear all the consequences.
The Law on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong SAR is an important step to ensure the steady and
sustained implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" principle. Its implementation will strengthen Hong Kong's
legal framework, ensure social order, improve business environment, and contribute to Hong Kong's prosperity and
stability. The attempt to pressure China will never succeed.
China urges Australia to immediately change course, stop intervening in Hong Kong affairs and China's domestic affairs,
and prevent further harm to China-Australia relations.
On your second question, I noticed the report and Adrian Zenz's argument. Why is he so anxious to speak if he's done
nothing to be guilty of? It's common sense that all deliberate slanders should be condemned and held accountable.
As is widely known, Adrian Zenz and the ASPI have been smearing China by fabricating lies. Their rumors on China have
already been proven false by facts like a slap in the face. So if the report you mentioned is true, I'm not even surprised.
It's not the first time that Chinese and foreign media reveal those behind Zenz and the ASPI. I'll not repeat it here. Here's
a piece of advice: come back to the right course as soon as possible, because too many vile deeds will inevitably lead to
one's self-destruction.
On your third question, I am not aware of the situation, but we hope and believe that people of vision who truly care
about Hong Kong will choose to act in ways beneficial to Hong Kong's development. China will continue to engage in
constructive dialogues with the Vatican and work for the improvement of bilateral relations.
Shenzhen TV: The Daily Telegraph reported an Oxford University expert's opinion that as is proved by more and more
evidence, the coronavirus may have lain dormant across the world and emerged when the environmental conditions were
right for it to thrive rather than starting in China. What is China's comment?
Zhao Lijiang: The report once again vindicates the fact that tracing the origin of the virus is a complex scientific issue,
and it is up to scientists around the world to conduct international scientific research and cooperation. WHO officials have
said virus tracing is an ongoing process that may involve multiple countries and localities. As this process proceeds, we
should be open to the many possibilities for where the virus may come from.
China continues supporting scientists around the world in conducting global scientific research on the source and route
of transmission of the virus. We also support WHO-led cooperation among member states on the zoonotic source of
COVID-19 and in other fields.
Global Times: Several media outlets have reported that a number of Chinese students in Australia were recently
subjected to racial discrimination and even violent attacks. On July 4, a Chinese student at the University of South
Australia was seriously injured in an abuse and attack near Adelaide's Chinatown by three local men. What is China's
comment?
Zhao Lijian: Recently there has been rising discrimination against overseas Chinese, including Chinese students, and
even Asians in Australia. Some of them suffered violent attacks, and their physical and mental health and even lives
were seriously threatened. In response to these circumstances, the Chinese government issued a travel advisory and
an alert for Chinese students going to study in Australia. This is a truly responsible practice.
We once again remind students who plan to study or are studying in Australia to conduct a risk assessment and be
cautious when making the choice to go or return to Australia, and remind the overseas Chinese in Australia to
strengthen safety precautions. We once again urge the Australian side to face up to the problem and take concrete
measures to protect the safety, rights and interests of Chinese citizens in Australia.
Xinhua News Agency: The website of the US Department of Defense released Secretary Mark Esper's message on the
accomplishments in the implementation of the National Defense Strategy on July 7. He said that ""China and Russia
constitute our top strategic competitors"", and that ""we established a China Strategy Management Group and I directed
the National Defense University to refocus its curriculum by dedicating 50 percent of the coursework to the PRC."" Do
you have any comment?
Zhao Lijian: This US official's remarks and the 2018 National Defense Strategy he mentioned are fundamentally flawed
and run counter to the trend of the times as they preach nothing but obsolete concepts of a Cold-War mentality, a
zero-sum game mindset, and hyped-up strategic competition between major countries.
China's policy towards the US is consistent and clear. We are committed to working with the US side for non-conflict,
non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation. At the same time, we are firmly committed to
safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests. China urges the US to discard its Cold-War
mentality and ideological bias, view the world and China-US relations in the 21st century in a correct way, and work
with China to move forward the bilateral relations along the track of coordination, cooperation and stability.
China Daily: It is reported that Côte d'Ivoire's Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly passed away on July 8. What's
your comment?
Zhao Lijian: We deeply mourn the passing of Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly and extend sincere condolences to
the government of Côte d'Ivoire and his family.
Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly was friendly to China and made contributions to the development of China-Côte
d'Ivoire relations. China stands ready to work with Côte d'Ivoire for more progress in our friendly cooperation.
The Paper: According to people familiar with the matter, Chinese and Indian armies are expected to carry out a joint
verification to assess the implementation of the disengagement process once the withdrawal of troops is completed in
the western sector of China-India boundary. The two militaries are set to hold extensive talks on bringing back peace
and tranquility in the region. Can you confirm that and give us some updates on the disengagement? Will there be
more bilateral talks between Chinese and Indian troops?
Zhao Lijian: Following the consensus reached at the commander-level talks, the Chinese and India border troops have
been taking effective measures to disengage at Galwan Valley and other areas in the western sector. The overall
situation at the China-India boundary is stable and ameliorating. The two sides will continue to maintain dialogue and
communication through military and diplomatic channels, including holding a new round of commander-level talks and
the meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs. We hope India
will work with China towards the same goal to implement consensus reached between the two sides with concrete
actions and jointly de-escalate tensions in the border region.
BBC: Earlier you mentioned that Australia was in breach of basic norms governing international relations with its
comments and moves regarding Hong Kong. Can you tell us which laws they are?
Zhao Lijian: Isn't ""non-interference in other countries' internal affairs"" a basic norm governing international
relations? Do I have to elaborate?
Associated Press of Pakistan: According to reports, Chinese and Pakistani experts held a video conference on
COVID-19 yesterday. Could you give us more details?Zhao Lijian: Experts from China and Pakistan held a video conference on COVID-19 on July 8. The meeting was co-
chaired by Yao Wen, Deputy Director-General of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, andDr. Aamer Ikram, Executive Director of Pakistan's National Institute of Health. Participants include Chinese
Ambassador to Pakistan Yao Jing, experts of China's National Health Commission, representatives of Pakistan's
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and embassy in China, and public health experts from both countries. Chinese experts
briefed their Pakistani colleagues on China's prevention and control experience, practices in clinical diagnosis and
treatment and the progress in vaccine research and development. They also took questions raised by the Pakistani
side.
Both sides spoke highly of the mutual support and close cooperation since the epidemic broke out. They believe this
meeting further enhances mutual understanding and agree to continuously strengthen technical exchange,
experience sharing and cooperation on vaccine R&D, jointly cope with the epidemics and uphold public health
security of the two countries and the world at large.
AFP: Yesterday French foreign minister said that France was considering taking measures in response to China's
implementation of the law on safeguarding national security in Hong Kong. He didn't specify what these measures
could be, but several European countries could join the move. Do you have any comment on that?
Zhao Lijian: We noticed the reports. I'd like to stress that Hong Kong affairs are China's internal affairs that allow no
foreign interference. We hope those countries can view the Law in a fair and objective manner, exercise prudence in
their words and deeds, and do things that are conducive to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.

"China: Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian's Regular Press Conference on July 9, 2020",Francis (Pope),Others,2020-07-10,"China News Service: According to reports, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized China's political system and
epidemic response at a press conference on July 8. Do you have any comment?
Zhao Lijian: For quite some time Pompeo has been busy concocting fake news to vilify China and drive a wedge between
China and other countries. All this has laid bare his deep-seated Cold War mindset, zero-sum game mentality and
ideological prejudices.
Facts can speak for themselves, while lies repeated a thousand times are still lies. We advise this US politician to rectify
his mistakes and stop spreading the political virus to avoid become a laughing stock.
CCTV: A follow-up question. US Secretary of State Pompeo said in the same interview that ""Beijing claimed for months
that it reported the outbreak of the virus to the WHO. Now we know that's not true."" He also said, the CPC ""has an
enormous credibility problem"", that it ""chose to hide and obfuscate and deny basic truth"", and that it ""has to be held
accountable."" I wonder if you have any comment?
Zhao Lijian: The first thing I want to say is, Mr. Pompeo, stop talking about credibility, truth or accountability because we
are so fed up with your words.
Speaking of credibility, while promoting ""America first"" in recent years, the US has been habitually breaching its
international commitments and obligations and withdrawing from organizations and treaties. It is literally the biggest
""trouble maker"" in the world.
Speaking of the truth, I'd like to ask Mr. Pompeo: can US government tell people in America and around the world the truth behind the Fort Detrick biolab, the EVALI, and the US biolabs located all over the world?
Speaking of accountability, in less than six months, there have been over three million confirmed COVID-19 cases and
more than 130,000 death tolls in the US; the US government should indeed be held accountable for this.
With their own image and reputation hitting rock-bottom, I wonder why Mr. Pompeo and his like are so brazen to talk
about credibility, truth and accountability? We advise those US politicians heed the strong rejection from the international
community to the country's frequent pullback from various agreements and organizations.
After the COVID-19 broke out, China notified the WHO at the earliest time possible, and the timelines published by both
sides have listed all the facts that are mutually corroborated. Turning a blind eye to the internationally acknowledged
facts, Pompeo is so obsessed in fabricating lies and shifting the blame. His behaviors, instead of covering up the
incompetence of the US side to fight the pandemic, only reveal his nature of lying and cheating and some American
officials' hypocrisy, arrogance and ignorance.
Reuters: First question, out of concerns over China's national security law for Hong Kong, the Australian Prime Minister
today announced the decision to suspend the country's extradition agreement with Hong Kong and extend visas for Hong
Kong residents in Australia. Do you have any comment? Second, Global Times cited sources that China is considering
suing the German scholar Adrian Zenz and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Can you confirm this? Third question,
in his speech on Sunday, Pope Francis didn't talk about his concerns over freedom and human rights in Hong Kong which
he planned to speak of. Some say Pope Francis may have been under China's pressure. Has China asked the Vatican not
to talk about Hong Kong?
Zhao Lijian: On your first question, the Australian side's comments and measures are in serious violation of international
law and the basic norms governing international relations. They constitute gross interference in China's internal affairs,
and China doesn't accept it. We express strong condemnation and reserve the right to make further reaction, and
Australia should bear all the consequences.
The Law on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong SAR is an important step to ensure the steady and
sustained implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" principle. Its implementation will strengthen Hong Kong's
legal framework, ensure social order, improve business environment, and contribute to Hong Kong's prosperity and
stability. The attempt to pressure China will never succeed.
China urges Australia to immediately change course, stop intervening in Hong Kong affairs and China's domestic affairs,
and prevent further harm to China-Australia relations.
On your second question, I noticed the report and Adrian Zenz's argument. Why is he so anxious to speak if he's done
nothing to be guilty of? It's common sense that all deliberate slanders should be condemned and held accountable.
As is widely known, Adrian Zenz and the ASPI have been smearing China by fabricating lies. Their rumors on China have
already been proven false by facts like a slap in the face. So if the report you mentioned is true, I'm not even surprised.
It's not the first time that Chinese and foreign media reveal those behind Zenz and the ASPI. I'll not repeat it here. Here's
a piece of advice: come back to the right course as soon as possible, because too many vile deeds will inevitably lead to
one's self-destruction.
On your third question, I am not aware of the situation, but we hope and believe that people of vision who truly care
about Hong Kong will choose to act in ways beneficial to Hong Kong's development. China will continue to engage in
constructive dialogues with the Vatican and work for the improvement of bilateral relations.
Shenzhen TV: The Daily Telegraph reported an Oxford University expert's opinion that as is proved by more and more
evidence, the coronavirus may have lain dormant across the world and emerged when the environmental conditions were
right for it to thrive rather than starting in China. What is China's comment?
Zhao Lijiang: The report once again vindicates the fact that tracing the origin of the virus is a complex scientific issue,
and it is up to scientists around the world to conduct international scientific research and cooperation. WHO officials have
said virus tracing is an ongoing process that may involve multiple countries and localities. As this process proceeds, we
should be open to the many possibilities for where the virus may come from.
China continues supporting scientists around the world in conducting global scientific research on the source and route
of transmission of the virus. We also support WHO-led cooperation among member states on the zoonotic source of
COVID-19 and in other fields.
Global Times: Several media outlets have reported that a number of Chinese students in Australia were recently
subjected to racial discrimination and even violent attacks. On July 4, a Chinese student at the University of South
Australia was seriously injured in an abuse and attack near Adelaide's Chinatown by three local men. What is China's
comment?
Zhao Lijian: Recently there has been rising discrimination against overseas Chinese, including Chinese students, and
even Asians in Australia. Some of them suffered violent attacks, and their physical and mental health and even lives
were seriously threatened. In response to these circumstances, the Chinese government issued a travel advisory and
an alert for Chinese students going to study in Australia. This is a truly responsible practice.
We once again remind students who plan to study or are studying in Australia to conduct a risk assessment and be
cautious when making the choice to go or return to Australia, and remind the overseas Chinese in Australia to
strengthen safety precautions. We once again urge the Australian side to face up to the problem and take concrete
measures to protect the safety, rights and interests of Chinese citizens in Australia.
Xinhua News Agency: The website of the US Department of Defense released Secretary Mark Esper's message on the
accomplishments in the implementation of the National Defense Strategy on July 7. He said that ""China and Russia
constitute our top strategic competitors"", and that ""we established a China Strategy Management Group and I directed
the National Defense University to refocus its curriculum by dedicating 50 percent of the coursework to the PRC."" Do
you have any comment?
Zhao Lijian: This US official's remarks and the 2018 National Defense Strategy he mentioned are fundamentally flawed
and run counter to the trend of the times as they preach nothing but obsolete concepts of a Cold-War mentality, a
zero-sum game mindset, and hyped-up strategic competition between major countries.
China's policy towards the US is consistent and clear. We are committed to working with the US side for non-conflict,
non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation. At the same time, we are firmly committed to
safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests. China urges the US to discard its Cold-War
mentality and ideological bias, view the world and China-US relations in the 21st century in a correct way, and work
with China to move forward the bilateral relations along the track of coordination, cooperation and stability.
China Daily: It is reported that Côte d'Ivoire's Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly passed away on July 8. What's
your comment?
Zhao Lijian: We deeply mourn the passing of Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly and extend sincere condolences to
the government of Côte d'Ivoire and his family.
Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly was friendly to China and made contributions to the development of China-Côte
d'Ivoire relations. China stands ready to work with Côte d'Ivoire for more progress in our friendly cooperation.
The Paper: According to people familiar with the matter, Chinese and Indian armies are expected to carry out a joint
verification to assess the implementation of the disengagement process once the withdrawal of troops is completed in
the western sector of China-India boundary. The two militaries are set to hold extensive talks on bringing back peace
and tranquility in the region. Can you confirm that and give us some updates on the disengagement? Will there be
more bilateral talks between Chinese and Indian troops?
Zhao Lijian: Following the consensus reached at the commander-level talks, the Chinese and India border troops have
been taking effective measures to disengage at Galwan Valley and other areas in the western sector. The overall
situation at the China-India boundary is stable and ameliorating. The two sides will continue to maintain dialogue and
communication through military and diplomatic channels, including holding a new round of commander-level talks and
the meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs. We hope India
will work with China towards the same goal to implement consensus reached between the two sides with concrete
actions and jointly de-escalate tensions in the border region.
BBC: Earlier you mentioned that Australia was in breach of basic norms governing international relations with its
comments and moves regarding Hong Kong. Can you tell us which laws they are?
Zhao Lijian: Isn't ""non-interference in other countries' internal affairs"" a basic norm governing international
relations? Do I have to elaborate?
Associated Press of Pakistan: According to reports, Chinese and Pakistani experts held a video conference on

"Biases you didn't know existed in the healthcare industry, and how they impact patients and medical professionals","Ettinger, Zoë",Others,2020/07/29,"Biases are forms of discrimination in which we hold unfair beliefs about an entire group of people. These biases can be conscious (explicit) or
unconscious (implicit).
Business Insider spoke to Dr. Jasmine Marcelin, a doctor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and Dr. Chloë Fitzgerald, a researcher of
implicit bias, to gain a greater understanding of bias in medicine.
Both explicit and implicit bias are prevalent in the medical field, and they can affect how patients of different races, genders, faiths, and
sexualities are treated.
Due in part to biases, black women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women, according to
the CDC.
Though there has been great progress in reducing explicit biases, implicit biases are much harder to tackle, and they take active participation
to identify and eliminate.
Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.
Biases are present in many human interactions. These typically unfair assumptions, which can encompass entire groups of people, affect how
we feel about and treat members of other races, genders, faiths, weights, sexualities, and abilities. In healthcare, the effect of biases on
patients can lead to dangerous consequences.
Explicit biases, or conscious biases, are easier to detect because they are overt, according to Dr. Chloë Fitzgerald, who co-authored Implicit
bias in healthcare professionals: a systematic review, which was published in BMC Medical Ethics.
""If someone had explicit bias, they might say, 'Oh, you know, obese people just don't work as hard, or they're lazy,'"" Dr. Fitzgerald told
Business Insider. However, ""if it was implicit, they might choose someone else over an obese person to do a task because they'll assume the
obese person will be slower to do it,"" she said.
Dr. Jasmine Marcelin, who co-authored The Impact of Unconscious Bias in Healthcare: How to Recognize and Mitigate It in The Journal of
Infectious Diseases, said a lower presence of minorities in the medical field perpetuates bias.
Dr. Fitzgerald and Dr. Marcelin identified ways biases affect the healthcare industry.
Explicit bias against diverse groups has led to extreme abuse within the medical profession, like the Tuskegee Syphilis Study conducted
between 1932 and 1972.
The Tuskegee Syphilis Study was an experiment that spanned 40 years, starting in 1932. It involved 600 black men, 399 with syphilis, and
201 without the disease, to test the effects of untreated syphilis. The study was carried out without their consent, as researchers told the men that they were being treated for ""bad blood,"" a term used to describe several ailments, including syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. (In 1974, a $10
million settlement was reached out of court with the participants and their families, and in 1997, President Bill Clinton apologized to them on
behalf of the country.)
""The Tuskegee study demonstrated how conscious bias, in this case manifested in the form of racism, led to the unethical treatment of black
men that continues to have long-lasting effects on health equity and justice in today's society,"" Dr. Marcelin said.
Due in part to biases, black women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women, according to
the CDC.
Dr. Fitzgerald said black women were historically abused by white doctors performing gynecological procedures on them without their consent.
These doctors held the false belief that black women somehow experienced less pain.
The field of infectious diseases is also affected by implicit bias, according to Dr. Marcelin.
She is passionate about reducing biases in the field of infectious disease.
""I definitely think from a pandemic standpoint there is a huge risk for minority groups who are affected. We have a lot of data that shows that
the effects of systemic racism and bias on minority groups has led to worse outcomes in those groups,"" she said.
Black people are 2.4 times more likely to die from the coronavirus.
Data from AMP Research Lab revealed that there were 54.5 coronavirus-related deaths per 100,000 in America's black population, while there
were 22.7 per 100,000 for America's white population.
Though these deaths can be attributed in part to the way systemic racism makes black people less likely to have access to healthy food, green
spaces, and livable wages, they could also be a result of the biases black people experience in healthcare.
A review published in Academic Emergency Medicine compiled studies on implicit bias in healthcare professionals and found that a in a
majority of studies, physicians showed an implicit preference for white patients.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention even released guidelines for healthcare professionals to ensure they are not allowing bias to
influence their treatment of patients during the pandemic.
Biases can also affect how medical professionals treat their colleagues, and minority medical professionals face microaggressions.
Microagressions are brief but common negative verbal or non-verbal behaviors against minorities.
An example Dr. Marcelin gave of a microagression is from a YouTube video in which an Asian woman is running on a trail in California, and
another jogger stops her and asks her where she's from. The woman responds that she is from California, but the other person says, ""No, but
where are you from, from?"" This assumes that just because the woman is of Asian heritage, that she cannot be from the United States.
Dr. Marcelin shared that she herself has experienced bias in the workplace — from both patients and colleagues — as an African American
female doctor.
Dr. Marcelin, not pictured, said, ""There are many times that I have walked into patient situations and they have assumed that I am not the one
that's in charge, even after I have identified myself as being the attending. I've had other healthcare professionals barging in on me in the
middle of talking with patients and completely ignoring my presence in the room with the patient. I've had patients who asked me to take out
their trash.""
Minorities in the healthcare field often have to pay the ""minority tax"" at work, Dr. Marcelin added. That is, they expend extra time and effort
trying to combat bias and educate others on the effects of bias, with no compensation for their work.
Many diseases have been historically examined in male bodies, with the assumption that the same diagnoses would apply to women.
Heart attacks, for example, can be experienced differently by women, and doctors have misdiagnosed women who've had them. ""Women can
experience pain in heart attacks in quite different ways that don't fit what we often think of as the classic heart attack,"" said Dr. Fitzgerald.
Men are also affected by biases. They are less likely to be diagnosed with mental health issues since they present them differently, said Dr.
Fitzgerald.
Depressed men may present as angry rather than sad, according to the University of Rochester Medical Center. It is also often harder for men
with depression to get help, due to stereotypes of sadness as weakness in men.
Countries with low rates of obesity have biases against people who are obese.
Biases against the obese often discount genetic and health factors that affect weight.
""Stereotypes against the obese may manifest in a lack of effort to make a connection with the patient, spending less time in clinical
interaction and ultimately less investigation of different diagnoses,'"" said Dr. Fitzgerald.
Though the medical field shares the same biases as the general population, some specialties, like pediatrics, display somewhat lower levels,
said Dr. Fitzgerald.
A 2008 study found implicit biases in pediatrics to be slightly lower than biases towards adults. The authors cited that further research is
required to assess the effect on quality of care.
LGBTQ populations experience disparities in physical and mental health outcomes due to biases, according to Dr. Marcelin's research.
""Stigma and bias (both conscious and unconscious) projected by medical professionals toward the LGBTQ population play a major role in
perpetuating these disparities,"" wrote Dr. Marcelin.
In the medical field, ""there's a lack of LGBTQ mentorship, poor recognition of scholarship opportunities, and noninclusive or even hostile
institutional climates,"" she wrote.
Dr. Marcelin's research showed that LGBTQ junior physicians did not disclose their sexual identity on residency applications for fear of
rejection.
Junior physicians in the field also reported that they did not disclose that they are gay to colleagues and supervisors for fear of rejection or
poor evaluations.
Though the US population is relatively diverse, there is a low rate of diversity in the healthcare profession.
According to Dr. Marcelin's research, although the US population is 13% African American and 18% Hispanic, only 3% of full-time medical
school faculty is African American and only 4% is Hispanic.
In medicine, high rates of diversity lead to excellence in treatment. Reducing biases is everyone's issue, said Dr. Marcelin.
""Diversity is better overall for everyone. So what needs to [change] is more white people, especially straight white men, who need to
embrace the importance of diversity and inclusion and equity. Recognize why it's important to recognize the benefits and put in the effort to
[make that change],"" said Dr. Marcelin.

Racist slurs reflect US failure to deal with outbreak,"Chen, Weihua",Others,2020-07-11,"The latest use of ""China virus"" and ""kung flu"" by the US president and some other US leaders is not just a
presidential election year stunt and a desperate bid to deflect public attention from the administration's failure
to timely and appropriately respond to the pandemic, but blatant racism that people should not ignore, let alone
condone.
The US president indulged in racist slurs during his 2016 election campaign, and now with his job approval
rating holding steady at a low level and the picture of the US' response to the novel coronavirus pandemic
looking increasingly bleak, blaming China to distract American public attention has become a strategy for the US
administration ahead of the presidential election scheduled for November.
Gallup polls in the past week showed that only 38 percent of Americans approve of the job the US president has
been doing while a new high of 65 percent of adults in the US say the pandemic situation in the country is
getting worse, contradicting what the US administration claims.
With more than 3 million COVID-19 cases and 131,000 deaths, the US is by far the worst-hit country, which
reflects its poor pandemic control and mitigation response. Many other economies, such as the European Union,
have effectively flattened, even lowered the curve after suffering a heavy blow. Yet the world's only superpower
continues to set single-day records - it registered more than 60,000 new cases on Tuesday.
That's why US politicians have intensified their attacks against China, often using racist language, in campaign rallies, on TV and social media, in a bid to deflect public criticism.
Sadly, resorting to such racist rhetoric is regarded as a good strategy by some Republicans to appeal to the
voters. The fact that many supporters in campaign rallies cheered the leaders who used racist language should
shock the world, especially after worldwide anti-racism protests sparked by the death of African American
George Floyd due to police brutality in Minnesota on May 25.
The racist slurs relished by top US officials are also partly responsible for the increasing discrimination and
attacks against Asian Americans. A Pew survey released on July 1 showed that about four in 10 US adults say it
has become more common for people to express racist views against Asians since the pandemic broke out.
However, the condemnation of such racist language against Asian Americans is more muted than during the
recent Black Lives Matter movement. Peter Navarro, a White House trade adviser with a track record of hate
speech against China, has frequently used lies and racist language in his interviews with US media outlets lately,
but he has often gone unchecked and unchallenged. Which speaks volumes of how media outlets sometimes,
intentionally and unintentionally, spread racism.
MSNBC host Ali Velshi set a good example by quickly contesting Navarro who was peddling his conspiracy theory
last Saturday on a program saying China ""spawned the virus"" and ""they hid the virus. They sent hundreds of
thousands of Chinese nationals over here to seed and spread the virus before we knew"". Velshi was quick to
question Navarro: ""What are you talking about?""
And in reply to the US president's tweet on Monday that ""China has caused great damage to the United States
and the rest of the World!"", I tweeted that the whole world knows how incompetent and anti-science he has
been in his response to the outbreak. The tweet received more than half a million views and has been quoted by
several news outlets.
Those US politicians may not stop using xenophobia and racism to advance their political agenda, but at least
sane people across the world should speak out more forcefully against such hate rhetoric, so as to not become
their accomplices.

World: Racism in Germany: A Chinese-American reckoning,None,Others,2020-06-15,"In a personal essay, DW's Beina Xu reflects on a coronavirus-related racist attack and confronts Europe's deeply problematic idea of race.
I hadn't seen him coming. The man was short, stocky, roughly my father's age. Suddenly he was standing before me as I sat having a drink on a bench. He pointed at the face mask crumpled in his other fist.
""This is shit,"" he informed me. I blinked out of confusion.
""Corona comes from China,"" he clarified. ""It's shit, what you brought here.""
My first thought was the image on the cover of German news magazine Der Spiegel, in late January. It was a photo of an Asian person in a red hazmat suit, captioned with an alarming yellow font ""Made in China: When Globalization Becomes a Deadly Threat.
I stared at the man. He seemed like a meek, ordinary retiree. I tried to see what he saw in me-and I could, because I'd ingested those same images my whole life. Looking at my face is to look at centuries of Eastern bodies in the white imagination: the silent, ""almond-eyed masseuse; the replicated worker manufacturing replicas; the sun-dried slave born in a bamboo forest, who built your railroads but will nonetheless steal your social security. There's the buck-toothed cook, and small-footed prostitute.
Faces like mine have freakishly adorned magazines, movies, books, and posters since Marco Polo galloped home in the 13th century. As an Asian woman who spent her life in the West, I can assure you that the pain of understanding yourself through the gaze of whites is double-edged: it kills you, then shows you how to survive.
But the title of pandemic creator was a first. Racism is dynamic; it morphs to fit political expediency. And it is exposing a harrowing crack in the European project. Amidst the global reckoning about race ignited by the death of George Floyd, I want to make one thing clear: that Western Europe touts a vile relativism when it comes to facing its own racism. It points its finger at the US as if to say, we're not as bad as that.
I'd like to remind them, in my red hazmat suit, of just one detail: that the adolescent nation internally combusting from racial pain was the brainchild of European colonialism. That is to say: it is, and always was, a project founded on the vision of white supremacy.
A matter of bad manners
Let's address the curiosity before it gets in the way: I am Chinese. I grew up in the US, studied in Europe, and have been living in Berlin for six years. It goes without saying that the racism I endure in the West is persistent, quotidian, and mind-numbingly unoriginal. But because I am not getting knifed by Nazis, most Germans diminish my experiences to a matter of bad manners by bad people.
""He's just a racist nut,"" a German friend said of the vitriolic pensioner (as if that were ever a source of comfort.) ""Most people aren't like that.""
When she said ""most people,"" I didn't know if she included her own sister, who imitated the Chinese language in front of me at the dinner table. (A resounding performance akin to, as the old joke goes, throwing a fork down the stairs.) Or my former water polo coach, who referred to the slits in
a kickboard as my eyes. Or the French boutique owner who approached me at a bar to continue the Olympic pastime of verifying ""what kind of Asian"" I was-just so she could win a bet with her friend.
And lest we forget those self-congratulating liberals who actually work in the name of human rights and journalistic diversity-whose insistence on their non-racism is so dogged and shameless that on my first day at work, they invited me to an editorial conference during which I realized I was the only person of color at a table of twenty.
I certainly don't consider any of the above people nuts. They just seem to equate poor manners with systemic oppression and othering rooted in the racial hierarchy their ancestors created at the beginning of their conquest of Earth. And this is something Germans seem to know little about: not a single German I've met knew that a part of China was once their colonial project-Qingdao, my grandparents' ancestral home, where the Kaiser blew through with his Navy and set up shop to brew his beloved pilsner, still widely exported today.
And thus I find it distasteful to have to remind Germans, in their own country, about what Hannah Arendt meant when she wrote about the banality of evil. It is not murderous, diabolic scheming - but rather the ""inability to think, namely, to think from the standpoint of somebody else, that leads us to unfathomable chambers.
How bad is 'bad'?
I got ahead of myself when I said I wasn't getting knifed by Nazis. A few months ago, a woman of East Asian descent living in the Netherlands woke up to a swastika scratched into the hallway outside her flat. In Munich, a German woman from China was assaulted by a neighbor, who sprayed her with disinfectant, screamed ""corona,"" and threatened to cut off her head.
The morning after my incident, my Vietnamese neighbor posted a notice on our building door that for over a month, someone had been stuffing trash and used tissues in his mailbox. ""I don't know what your mailboxes look like,"" he wrote, ""but mine looks like corona racism."" Getting harassed on the street is close, but at home is closer.
To live in a place is to continue its history. What I felt in this moment was a cold-sweat reckoning of Germany's past. There is a particular kind of horror one feels thinking about the path fear has taken on the very ground you stand on. There is yet another when you realize what that implies for your own condition: that you are living in unprecedented times, when the stability of the world order is teetering-and you're the one they're blaming.
To put it explicitly: never before have I felt so afraid.
I chose to pen this piece as an act of resistance-because I have the privilege to articulate my voice to an audience, and because we should never forget what kind of power it is to disseminate words on a mass scale. But I am also desperate about the limits of language, as I am desperate about many things today. This moment is a hostile, desolate one. It is so painful to write. If you take anything with you at the end of this piece, dear reader, let it be the call to think.",6241
"Coronavirus stoking rising racism against Chinese-Canadians, survey finds",None,Others,2020-06-25,"A survey in Canada has confirmed reports that racism against people of Chinese ethnicity has been on the rise since the country reported its first cases of Covid-19 in March.
Half of the Chinese-Canadians polled said they had been called names or insulted as a direct consequence of the pandemic and 43 per cent said they had been personally threatened or intimidated.
More than 60 per cent of respondents had adjusted their daily routines in a bid to avoid unpleasant encounters.
The survey, which questioned 516 Canadians of Chinese ethnicity, was conducted by the University of Alberta and the Angus Reid Institute, a non-profit public opinion research agency, against a backdrop of rising anti-China and anti-Asian racism, as well as xenophobia.
Vancouver police said in May that anti-Asian hate crime was on the rise, with 16 reports made in March and April, compared to 12 in the whole of 2019. Also in May, two lion statues at the entrance to the city's Chinatown were defaced twice with racist graffiti.
Discrimination has been stoked by the use of terms such as ""Chinese virus"" and ""Wuhan virus"" by senior figures in the United States, including President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. While Trump dropped references to the ""Chinese virus"" in late March, he has recently returned to racially charged terms like ""kung flu"" and ""Chinese flu"" at his campaign events.
The survey found two-thirds of respondents felt coverage from North American news outlets had led to negative views of Chinese-Canadians, while three in 10 said they were frequently exposed to racist graffiti or messaging on social media.
A quarter said they were treated with less respect because of their Chinese ethnicity and a similar share said they were made to feel as though they posed a threat to the health and safety of their fellow Canadians.
One man in his 60s told the survey team he had been spat at by a cyclist, while a woman in her 20s said: ""Walking down the street with a mask on, there have been instances where people will scream at me to go back to China or swear and say other racist remarks. I look Chinese but I am not from China, even though I have Chinese heritage. Makes it all very confusing.""
Another respondent, a woman in her 30s, said she had been repeatedly yelled at in the streets of her neighbourhood.",2331
Will sleep problems become a risk factor as the pandemic continues? [Healthcare],"Bhatt, Shephali",Others,2020-06-28,"Sonali Malaviya never obsessed about her sleep, until now. ""Normally, I would go to bed at 10:30 in the night and wake up by 6 am,"" says the Gurgaon-based tech marketing professional, who is in her early 40s. Over the last three months, though, she has been getting up at 3 am every night. ""I check my sleep tracking app once a week and it shows that I am only getting four hours of sleep every day.
Typically, when you wake up in the night, you go back to sleep. These days the mind is never at rest so that is not happening anymore,"" says Malaviya, filing it under latent Covid-19 stress.
The lack of sleep has emerged as a major casualty in the wake of the global pandemic and the subsequent lockdown it has brought about in many countries, say insomnia therapists around the world. People across age groups are worried about catching Covid or passing it on to their family. They are concerned about job security. In many cases, the lockdown restrictions leave them with nothing time-bound to wake up to either. All these have led to ""almost everyone"" seeking therapy complaining of lack of sleep or a ruptured sleep cycle, say the therapists. And at least one-third of these are facing this issue for the first time.
Ravi Kant, a 27-year-old student from IIM-Shillong, started having sleepless nights after the lockdown forced him to return to his hometown, Patna, thereby disrupting his college routine. Though the classes shifted online, worries about an uncertain future keep him wide awake till the wee hours of the morning. He now uses the time between midnight and 6 am to focus on studying instead.

""Family has also accepted this as my new normal."" As people are getting sleepless in Seattle, Shoreditch and Shillong, some are reaching out to tech for help. The downloads of sleep tracking app Sleep Monitor were up by 1.5X between April and May, and by 2X from May to June so far, at over a million Android installs. ""We saw a lot of users from the US and European countries (mainly from France, Italy, the UK, German, Turkey, Poland) from March to May,"" says a company spokesperson via email. ""In May and June, we saw users increasingly downloading the app from Brazil, Indonesia, Vietnam and Egypt. All those were organic users.""
76663832""People of colour are likely to have more sleep-related anxieties during these times. They prefer going to practitioners of colour but there aren't a lot of insomnia experts of colour in the country"" Joshua Tal, sleep and health psychologist, New York
Medication for sleep is the most preferred route in the US, say the therapists. In India, however, people prefer trying yoga, exercises, sleep-centric music and podcasts.
Sleep featured in the top 10 moods for users in India every week on Spotify since mid-April. Over the last three months, India was also among the top 10 streaming markets for popular sleep podcasts on the music-streaming app, according to data shared by the company's PR team.
Over 40% of the people approaching MindPeers, a mental health tech platform, suffer from sleep-related issues, says founder Kanika Agarwal who shuttles between Delhi and Singapore. ""Some people who reached out hadn't slept in 3-4 days,"" she says. The platform is active in Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru at present. Ishita Pateria, a counselling psychologist based in Mumbai, says she has seen a 70% spike in mild to major cases of insomnia among her clients in the past two months.

Lindsay Browning, a sleep expert from London, explains it with an analogy: ""If you see a lion coming to attack you, you will not be able to fall asleep, will you? Your body senses it to be a life-threatening danger and reacts accordingly. Heart rate goes up, so does your breathing rate, and there is a sudden rush of adrenaline.
It prompts the person to run in the opposite direction."" Covid-19 is what many see as a similar danger coming at them. ""But this time you can't physically run away."" So, the body responds to stress by staying awake.
76663842""Short-term sleep problems aren't going to kill anybody. Else, every new set of parents would be dead. Our bodies will be able to recover from this"" Lindsay Browning, sleep expert, London
The lockdown-led challenges don't help. The human body has a circadian rhythm that takes cues from the sun to follow a routine which keeps them awake during the day and asleep at night. ""A lot of people, say, in countries like Italy and cities like New York, live in flats that don't get enough sunshine to get these cues. While working from home,
people are also eating meals at erratic hours, which further confuses the body and messes up the circadian rhythm,"" she adds. 76663953Sonali Malaviya, early 40s Tech marketing professional, Gurgaon
""Typically when you wake up in the night, you go back to sleep soon enough. These days that is not happening""
Before Covid: Went to bed by 10:30
pm, out of bed by 6 am
Since Covid: Wide awake by 3 am
Cause: Latent stress about the uncertain future
Workaround: Reading books - the paper version - and leaving all devices aside
Some are more susceptible to sleep anxiety than others. ""Ethnic minorities like African Americans in the US and the Asians in the UK are more likely to have sleep problems,"" says Browning. Joshua Tal, a New York-based sleep and health psychologist, agrees. ""Due to systemic racism paired with the general distress around medical facilities at the moment, people of colour are likely to have more sleep-related anxieties during these times. They prefer going to practitioners of colour but there aren't a lot of insomnia experts of colour in the country, which leaves them feeling they are left alone,"" says Tal.
At MindPeers, 18-25-year-olds complain about sleep the most, citing concerns around uncertain career prospects. In the UK, Browning sees parents whose children are being home-schooled now suffering from lack of sleep. These parents care for kids during the day and tackle their work during late hours. ""Children are struggling with sleep, too,"" she says. ""In London, the Covid briefing happens at 5 pm. The kids watch the news along with parents and it affects them as well."" As if lack of sleep wasn't enough, many are now having recurring nightmares.
76663895""Our online classes have moved to evenings because a lot of people have better internet connectivity during the second half of the day in their hometowns. We're studying from evening to morning now. Families have understood this is our new normal""
Ravi Kant, 27, student at IIM-Shillong, lives in Patna Before Covid: Slept for 6-7 hours in the night
Since Covid: Sleeps only for 2-3 hours early morning Cause: Disruption in college routine
Workaround: Embraced the new sleep cycle for the time being
People in major Covid-hit cities like New York, Mumbai and London complain of vivid dreams that often align with the impact of the pandemic on their respective city. In New York, for instance, ""many talk about having disaster-related dreams where they see the city crumbling down in an Armageddon-like scenario,"" says Tal.
In Mumbai, Pateria's clients have spoken about dreaming of not being able to run away from an incoming threat. ""One of them said they saw someone coming to harm them but their legs were tied to each other so they couldn't escape."" In the UK, people have had emotionally unsettling dreams connected to their family, says Browning.
As minds are on high alert almost all the time, these nightmares also wake them up in the wee hours of the night.
Worries around sleep are valid. Therapists say a good sleep releases motivational hormones and charges up the mind and the body. A lack thereof makes way for stress hormones that result in physical and mental fatigue. Mumbai-based advert ising professional Omkar Joshi, 27, is worried his erratic sleep cycle during the lockdown period is turning into a habit that will be hard to come out of ""once normalcy returns"". However, Browning says this is likely to be a temporary issue and our bodies will be able to recover from this. ""Short-term sleep problems aren't going to kill anybody or every new set of parents would be dead,"" she says, reinforcing her point. Besides, losing sleep over sleeplessness may just make things worse. ""Embracing an erratic sleep cycle is the ideal approach at the moment, as sleep pressure compounds the issue,"" says Tal from New York.
Therapists also ask their clients to build a sleep routine instead of worrying about not getting enough sleep. This routine involves visualising their sleeping environment - the bed, the bedsheet, the pillow - to ease them into the act of sleeping. Mobiles should be kept away from the bed and fragrant lotions and music should be used. Rajkumari Daga, a 57-year-old homemaker from Mumbai is following a ""no coffee after 7 and dinner by 8"" routine to revert to her normal sleep cycle of 11 pm to 7 am which has gone for a toss in the last three months, she says. Shalini L, a Mumbai-based marketing professional, listens to music from meditation apps like Calm and Headspace to quell her sleeping anxiety. ""Since mid-March, as news of the global health crisis steadily increased, Headspace saw a 33% increase in its sleep music usage over the last 30 days of usage,"" says Rich Pierson, the CEO & cofounder of Headspace. The app has over 10 million downloads on Android at present.

Browning guides her clients on different breathing techniques to help them calm down. She also suggests people allocate some time during the day to process their worries, perhaps via expressive writing in journals.
""That way some of the tension is released during the day itself."" At MindPeers, Agarwal's team of psychologists often ask their clients to draw their palm on a paper and write all the things they can control within the palm and those out of their control outside the palm. It gives them perspective and a direction to tackle their worries, she says. A lot of people are also finding solace in the fact that they're not alone in this, that many people are battling insomnia at present.
Most therapists are also actively discouraging clients from using sleep trackers during this period if too much information about their sleep cycle overwhelms them. The makers of certain sleep trackers propagate this, too. ""If users express anxiety over tracking their sleep, we advise them to go scrap trackers and concentrate on how they feel in the morning. That is the best sleep quality score you will ever get,"" says Carl Johan Hederoth, CEO, Sleep Cycle, that has over 5 million Android installs.
Even Malaviya in Gurgaon has chosen not to get hassled by her sleep tracker's results anymore. ""When you look back at the many difficult things you have gone through in life, it doesn't feel as hard now as it did then,"" she says, hoping that it will be the same this time around, too.",11602
"US: Donald Trump terms coronavirus 'Kung Flu', Twitter bashes him for racism, Asian Americans especially unhappy",Falah Gulzar,Others,2020-06-21,"Donald Trump called the coronavirus 'Kung Flu' and 'the Chinese virus' during a campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma on June 20 and Twitter users, especially Asian Americans, are calling him out for racism.
The US President blamed China for the global spread of coronavirus, while terming the disease ‘Kung Flu’.
Trump, addressing his first election rally on Saturday in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in the US early this year, said that the COVID-19 is a disease and has many names.
“I can name – Kung flu. I can name 19 different versions of names. Many calls it a virus, which it is. Many calls it a flu. What difference. I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name,"" he said.
Soon after, ‘Kung Flu’ started trending on Twitter. Many users bashed Trump for using the term, calling it racist.
Posting updates on Trump’s address, Twitter user @PhilipRucker wrote: “Trump tells his rally crowd there are ‘many’ names for COVID-19. Then he utters one, ‘Kung Flu’, which many people consider racist.”
In a consecutive tweet, @PhilipRucker wrote: “To be clear, calling COVID-19 ‘Kung Flu’ is racist, period.”
Normalises racism
Ted W. Lieu, @tedlieu, an American politician serving as the US Representative for California's 33rd congressional district since 2015, took to his Twitter account to express his thoughts on the issue: “Dear @realDonaldTrump & @GOP: Asian Americans make up 11 per cent of the electorate in Nevada; 5.5 per cent in Texas and 4.7 per cent in Georgia, enough to be the margin of victory. Keep saying racist [...] like Kung Flu. Your racism is one reason Asian Americans now trend towards Democrats. #TrumpRally”
American actor, Chris Evans, @ChrisEvans, was left “speechless”: “Did the president of the United States just say ‘Kung flu’ at his rally? He made a racist joke. He made. A racist. Joke. To applause. I’m speechless.”
Tweep @eugenegu posted about how such actions could fuel discrimination against Asian Americans in the US: “When the President of the United States uses racist terms like Kung Flu, Chinese Virus, or China Plague, my biggest fear as an Asian American is that it normalises racism against us and there’s no way for us to fight it. We have very little representation in government and media.”
In the past, Trump administration officials have used similar terms.
Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, and Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, are among those who added a geographical marker to the coronavirus.
Pompeo has called the virus the “Wuhan coronavirus”, referring to the Chinese city where the outbreak started, and McCarthy has used the term “Chinese coronavirus”.",2658
'So heated'; Poll shows increasing racism toward Chinese-Canadians,"Kaufmann, Bill",Others,2020-06-23,"A recent poll suggesting half of Chinese-Canadians have endured racial slurs since the COVID-19 pandemic began should be a wakeup for the country, says an Alberta human rights activist.
The online survey of 516 Chinese-Canadians conducted June 15-18 also states 61% of its respondents had changed their daily routines in an effort to avoid backlash over the deadly virus, which originated in China.
""My assistant is afraid to go to the grocery store,"" said Serena Mah, spokeswoman for the group ACT2endracism, which sprang up in response to what its organizers call a recent spike in bigotry towards Asian-Canadians.
""There's a fear in the community it's going to escalate ... it's so heated out there.""
The poll conducted by the Angus Reid Institute in partnership with the University of Alberta also found 43% of those surveyed felt threatened or intimidated since the pandemic began more than three months ago and that nearly two-thirds believe North American news coverage fosters negative stereotypes about them.
Of the 57 members of her group's network, half have said they've experienced some form of racism over the past few months, said Mah, adding she's frustrated with the level of denial among Canadians.
""We spend so much time trying to convince people racism exists,"" she said.
Mah said racist incidents are underreported by those who don't fully trust government or don't know how to go about it.
""My own mother wouldn't want to report it, she wouldn't want to be a burden on police.""
Some observers also cite as a factor anger towards China over that country's 18-month detention of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in what many believe is a diplomatic dispute.
That hostility has led many Chinese-Canadians to feel they're not viewed as belonging, said human rights activist Teresa Woo-Paw. Only 13% of the poll's respondents say they believe they're accepted as Canadians all the time.
""People continue to see Chinese-Canadians as foreigners but there's a great deal of diversity in the community and a lot of it doesn't agree with (Chinese government policy),"" said Woo-Paw, who emigrated from Hong Kong at the age of 13.
That climate of backlash, she said, has made her worried about even walking through her neighbourhood.
""It crosses my mind of what would I say if I encounter it,"" said Woo-Paw.
Both women say there's an absence of comprehensive data on racist incidents by higher levels of government that leave that task to those without proper resources.
""We're pressing the federal government and asking them, 'Why is it the community's responsibility when you need standardized data to establish trends,' "" said Mah.
Last month in Calgary there were several graffiti attacks singling out China and Chinese people over the spread of COVID-19, two of them targeting the Asian country's consulate downtown.
But while such racism does exist in Calgary, it doesn't appear to be as prevalent here as in larger cities where police are investigating violent incidents targeting those of Asian descent, said Terry Wong, executive director of the Chinatown Business Improvement Area.
His group canvassed several hundred Chinese-Canadians the past few weeks about the issue and didn't receive any reports of mistreatment, said Wong, who also assists city police on diversity issues.
""That's not to say it's not happening, but it doesn't seem as overtly out there in Calgary society,"" said Wong.",3422
Spate of anti-Asian racism revealed,"Koslowski, Max",Others,2020-06-08,"Asian-Australians have reported almost 400 racist attacks since the beginning of April to the country's leading survey of anti-China racism.
The figures prompted calls for the federal government to track racism better as federal MPs accused the Chinese government of spreading divisive propaganda when on Saturday it encouraged its citizens to avoid travelling to Australia due to a ""significant increase"" in racial discrimination amid coronavirus.
Osmond Chiu, a fellow at independent progressive think tank Per Capita, authored the survey in collaboration with the Asian Australian Alliance and Being Asian Australian. ""There definitely has been an increase,"" he said, noting that compared to similar data from the United States there has been a higher proportion of racist incidents against Asian- Australians than Asian-Americans.
The survey, which started on April 2 and will be completed this month, has so far documented 386 racist incidents, including abuse, physical intimidation and spitting.
The survey also revealed that roughly 90 per cent of racist incidents were not being reported to police and the vast majority were perpetrated by strangers in public.
Mr Chiu called on the federal government to improve what he said was a disjointed incident reporting process, potentially through the Human Rights Commission.
Labor's multicultural affairs spokesman Andrew Giles backed the call as a way to help develop a strong anti-racism strategy.
""We've got to do a better job at tracking racism,"" Mr Giles said.
""There's clearly confusion as to how people can report racist incidents and we feel there's a role for national government to do considerably more.""
Liberal senator Andrew Bragg said the federal government had run an anti-racism campaign during the pandemic, encouraging Australians to report incidents to the Human Rights Commission. ""There's not much more we can do other than call it out from the Prime Minister, call it out from senior ministers and run a supportive campaign directly to people,"" he said. ""I'm very pleased with the response.""
Liberal senator James Paterson said China's comments were a diversion from its own conduct.
""Australians rightly deplore racism. Knowing this, the Chinese Communist Party uses accusations of racism in an attempt to divide us and deflect criticism of their own conduct,"" he said.
Mr Chiu accused the Chinese government of politicising racism, but noted there was a middle ground between calling out the Chinese Communist Party and recognising anti-Chinese racism was growing.
""If you look at it globally, you've seen an increase in COVID-related racism across the world,"" he said.",2647
"Unmasking racial politics of the covid-19 pandemic; Perception changes when Blacks, Asians wear face covering, writes Jasmine Zine","Zine, Jasmine",Others,2020-06-06,"Recently, the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised that along with physical distancing, wearing protective masks slows the spread of COVID- 19. Canada has made a similar announcement.
More than 50 countries now mandate wearing masks in public.
While primarily a protective measure, the COVID-19 mask has also become a cultural icon. In western nations it has become a marker of social responsibility and good citizenship. It represents the wearer's compliance with public safety and communal well-being through exercising care for one's self and others.
During the 2003 SARS crisis, ""mask culture"" was seen as fostering a sense of mutual obligation and civic duty. Similarly in our current pandemic, wearing a protective mask signifies a commitment to the social and collective good of society.
But how does that perception change when a face mask is worn by someone who is Asian? Or a Black man? Why do some jurisdictions outlaw the face veil or niqab worn by some Muslim women while mandating protective masks? Through European colonialism whiteness became the standard against which all other bodies are marked, judged and codified. American anti-racism educator Peggy MacIntosh argues that whiteness provides an ""invisible knapsack"" of unearned privileges that white people can often take for granted.
These are basic things like: going shopping and not be followed or harassed; never being asked to speak for all white people; and not having to educate one's children to be aware of systemic racism for their own daily physical protection.
The concept of white privilege can be related to how COVID-19 mask-wearing is seen differently when worn on racialized bodies.
For more than 100 years, Asians in North America have been represented as diseased foreigners and more recently blamed as ""pandemic starters.""
Rather than exemplifying a commitment to the public good, an abundance of pictures of Asian individuals wearing masks may have accelerated the circulation of derogatory stereotypes. Research has shown Canadian Press photos related to the 2003 SARS crisis used Asians wearing masks as a dominant image. With COVID 19, the trend of using masked Asian faces as the emblem of the crisis continues the trajectory of these racist depictions.
Instead of representing a good citizen helping to stop the spread of a possible contagion, a protective mask transforms Asian bodies into the source of contagion. Trump's insistence in referring to COVID-19 as the ""Chinese virus"" dangerously reinforced the racializing of this disease.
Anti-Asian hate crimes including physical and verbal assaults and vandalism have escalated along with the pandemic.
A recent report told a story of a woman in British Columbia who was accosted by two white men who yelled at her and her mother: ""Look at you with your masks, you're what's wrong with society.""
The risk of such attacks and harassment confronts Asian diasporas with a difficult choice: wear a mask and risk being subjected to violence or do not and bear the risk of contracting the virus.
A Black physician in Boston wrote about his internal struggle with wearing a mask in public because of the racist fears it evokes. He said: ""I wonder whether someone would call the police on me, a 'suspicious'Black man in a face mask. I negotiate with myself whether risking my life is worth a $300 fine.""
He has reason to worry. A Black doctor in Miami wearing a surgical mask was handcuffed outside his home by police.
The killings of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd in the United States are tragic events that reveal the very real dangers Black people face on a daily basis. And yet in early May, heavily armed, white protesters stormed the Michigan State capitol without incident.
A campaign spearheaded by a Black clergy in Illinois in co-operation with local police, called ""Tipping the Mask,"" asked people to show shopkeepers their faces when entering stores to mitigate against potential racial fears and violence.
A Black pastor recommended that his son put on his mask once he is already in the store for ""fear of what others might think when they see a Black man in a mask."" The concept of ""mask tipping"" calls upon racialized bodies to reveal themselves as ""safe"" and in return avoid biases and endangerment.
In Quebec, Bill 21, which outlaws religious symbols in public, leaves Muslim women who wear a niqab in breach of the law and denied access to social services, despite government requests for public face coverings due to the pandemic.
France also mandates wearing masks but has not lifted its ban on the niqab. Fatima Khemilat, a researcher in France exposes the irony.
Muslim women who wear a niqab are not considered good liberal citizens because their covered faces are deemed culturally irreconcilable with western society. They face being penalized for violating the law while those wearing COVID-19 masks are seen as good citizens upholding the public good.
The COVID-19 mask is a barrier to transmission of the virus while the niqab is a barrier to social inclusion.
Not having to think about how one's body is read by others when wearing a mask is a privilege of whiteness that eludes racialized groups. White mask privilege includes: not having to bear the racial stigma of being seen as a foreign disease carrier, being safe whether or not you ""tip your mask,"" having the ability to cover your face in public and not be denied social services.
Rather than serving as a levelling device the cultural politics behind wearing masks exposes the racial fault lines of the pandemic. Jasmin Zine is a professor of sociology at Wilfrid Laurier University. This column is republished from The Conversation website under Creative Commons licence.",5729
Some facing 'virus limbo' as overseas study plans change: Many students switching from foreign to local unis or deferring studies,"Davie, Sandra",Others,2020-06-14,"Had he stuck to his initial plans, Mr Darius Cheong, 21, would be heading to the University of Virginia to study business management in August this year.
He was convinced that four years in the United States would give him global exposure. But then the pandemic hit and reports of racist attacks on Asians in the US also worried him.
Mr Cheong has decided to alter course. Instead of going to the US, he has opted to pursue his degree studies at the Singapore Management University, which is known for its American style of teaching.
Similarly, Raffles Institution alumna Valerie Lu, 19, was all set to start her degree studies at the Maryland Institute College of Art in the US this September. But after factoring in the uncertainties and high cost of studying overseas, she applied to and secured a place at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) instead.
Mr Cheong and Miss Lu are among the Singaporeans who are giving up on their overseas study plans in favour of local universities.
Each of the six local universities received between 19 and 550 applications during the second admissions exercise held last month to cater to late applicants, they told The Sunday Times.
These included applicants who switched from overseas to local universities.
Another group of applicants were polytechnic diploma holders who had previously thought of going to work but were now opting to study because of the weak job market.
While the universities are still in the process of deciding how many applicants to take in, the National University of Singapore confirmed it had received 450 applications during the second admissions exercise and SUTD said it had received 550.
Students like Ms Lu and Mr Cheong are the lucky ones, though, with a definite path to pursue.
The Covid-19 outbreak has left many Singaporean students, with plans to study overseas, unsure of what the future holds.
COST CONSIDERATIONS
If teaching is still online, why would I go back? Sydney is not a cheap city to live in.
MS CELINE CHOO, 19, who started her studies at UNSW in February but had to return to Singapore 11/2 months later.
PURSUING ASPIRATIONS
It has been my dream since I was 10 and I have been working hard to get into a university like Stanford. I hope governments deal with the pandemic and it will still be possible for young people like me to pursue our aspirations.
MS ALICIA CHEONG, 18, who still hopes to study overseas.
Take Ms Stella Cheong, 22. A local university has offered her a place. But she still prefers to head to San Francisco to study business studies there. The situation has left her undecided. She calls it ""being in a coronavirus limbo"" and is prepared to defer her studies for up to six months.
Singapore Polytechnic alumnus Garreth Benjamin, 24, who headed back to Singapore in March, has also decided to put off the last semester of his commerce degree at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney till next year.
He had earlier planned to take up a three-month internship at an accounting firm in Sydney, but now realises that such positions will be hard to come by, so he is prepared to wait.
Interviews with two dozen Singaporeans already enrolled or about to enrol in overseas universities found that most like Mr Benjamin were deferring their studies by three to six months.
Those deferring said they prefer an on-campus education and complained that it was unfair of universities to charge the usual high international student fees for online classes.
Miss Celine Choo, 19, who started on the first year of her undergraduate degree at UNSW in February, had to head back to Singapore just 11/2 months later. Her tuition fees alone for this year will amount to $50,000.
She is taking up her courses online for now and says she would head back only if her university offers face-to-face classes. ""If teaching is still online, why would I go back? Sydney is not a cheap city to live in,"" she said.
The views and sentiments of Singaporeans tally with a survey conducted last month by IDP Connect, part of international education specialists IDP Education - which found that the majority of international students still hope to commence their studies as planned.
But the survey which polled 6,900 international students, including 180 Singaporeans, found that for students who had already chosen to defer or were considering to defer, the majority were only willing to defer for up to six months.
""Thirty-one percent of respondents stated they would be willing to start their course online and move to face-to-face learning at a later date, but by far the greatest preference was to defer to January 2021 if this meant face-to-face learning would be possible,"" said IDP Connect chief executive Simon Emmett.
He also said students who stated that they would prefer to defer than study online, said they wanted international exposure.
Many also stated that the standard of online teaching was a concern.
Separately, embassies here reported that they are trying their best to keep students updated with relevant information.
Mr Leighton Ernsberger, the British Council's director for education and English in East Asia, said the organisation, which provides information and counselling to students heading to Britain, is hosting online sessions, as well as virtual briefings for students.
EducationUSA also continues to offer advisory services and has held pre-departure orientations. Meanwhile, students, like Miss Alicia Cheong, 18, are keeping their fingers crossed.

"United States: US Watchdog Tracks Over 2,100 Anti-Asian Incidents",None,Others,2020-06-29,"Since mid-March, a U.S.-based coalition has tracked more than 2,100 anti-Asian hate incidents, a troubling figure that Asian American advocates say is being fueled in part by political rhetoric against China during the coronavirus pandemic.
While racial slurs and other forms of verbal harassment constituted the vast majority of the incidents, nearly eight percent involved physical assaults, businesses barring Asian Americans from entering their establishments due to misplaced coronavirus fears, and attackers coughing and spitting on victims, according to STOP AAPI Hate, an anti-Asian hate tracker.
In one incident in March, a group of African American teenagers on a commuter rail in San Francisco used their backpacks to attack a mask-wearing Asian American, saying he had COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Chinese Americans raise funds for medical supplies despite rising racial threats
In another occurrence in April, a stranger threw a large rock through the atrium window of a Chinese American family's house in Santa Rosa, California. The house had Chinese writing along the front door as a blessing for good health and harmony.
These are first-hand accounts where individuals are describing harrowing and traumatizing experiences, including what is being said to them when they're being attacked, said Cynthia Choi, co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, one of the coalition partners.
Asian Americans have been targeted before during public health crises, as was the case during the 2003 SARS epidemic. The latest wave of anti-Asian hate comes at a time of heightened tensions over the pandemic fueled by the anti-China rhetoric of President Donald Trump and other politicians. Trump, who initially praised China for its handling of the crisis, subsequently blamed China's leader Xi Jinping for waiting weeks to report the outbreak in Wuhan to the World Health Organization and covering up the severity of the problem.
Trump has repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as the Chinese virus and kung-flu, terms that Asian American advocates say are derogatory and have exacerbated the scapegoating of Americans of Asian descent.
Trump disputes that those and other terms are racist. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, who several weeks ago criticized the phrase kung-flu as highly offensive, and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany both said this week that the president used the term merely to highlight that the virus originated in China.
But Asian American leaders say the meaning is not lost on their fast-growing community.
Those are terms meant to be humiliating, said Gene Wu, a Chinese American Democratic member of the Texas House of Representatives.
Bill Ting, a Democratic state assemblyman in California, said the rhetoric has had a direct impact on the surge in anti-Asian harassment and hate crimes.
You see leaders express words that really give license to other people to express those same sentiments and also to act on them, Tung said.
In a recent report examining the link between political rhetoric and anti-Asian bias, STOP AAPI Hate, the Asian American coalition, found that reports of anti-Asian discrimination spiked after Trump repeatedly used the term Chinese virus.
While the vast majority of the 2,100-plus incidents recorded by STOP AAPI Hate do not rise to the level of a hate crime as defined by statute, more than 100 do, according to legal experts.
The FBI reports there has been an uptick in hate crimes and harassment against Asian Americans since the outbreak of COVID-19, which first appeared in Wuhan, China, late last year",3609
Asian American activists in solidarity with black community,"Chen, Karen; Pouv, Sovanna",Others,2020-06-11,"In light of the recent murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, and the numerous murders of black people by a white supremacist system, the Asian Pacific Islander Civic Action Network of Massachusetts (APIs CAN!) stands firmly with the black communities of this country. We call on each and every member of our AAPI community to stand up for black lives.
Our AAPI community has suffered recently from economic losses and anti-Asian racism as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. We know that under white supremacy, this violence is inextricable from the danger that black people face every day while jogging, sitting at home or just going about their everyday lives, from both the police and rightwing vigilantism. Any encounter with the police could turn deadly, and this long history of oppression of black people dates back centuries. Statistics show that a black person is killed by the police every twenty-eight hours. As immigrants and refugees and their children in this country, we inherit this ugly legacy, whether we want to or not.
Across the country, many of the businesses that were damaged or destroyed are owned by people of color and immigrants, including Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and many are black-owned as well. We express our sadness and sympathy for these business owners, many of whom have suffered tremendously due to the pandemic. However, we stand firmly with millions of peaceful protesters standing against police brutality, calling for justice for George Floyd and demanding a transformation of the system that murders, dehumanizes and systematically oppresses black people. We reject any attempt to pit the AAPI community against black communities. We cannot confront anti-Asian American racism without acknowledging and directly working against racism toward black communities.
As part of this, we must examine our own prejudices and deal with anti-black racism within our own community. One of the officers who stood by during George Floyd's killing was Tou Thao, an Asian American. Our community must speak unequivocally in solidarity with black communities to demand justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and so many others.
There is a history of Asian Americans being labelled the ""model minority"" in order to pit us against black communities and other people of color that dates back several decades. For this reason, it is particularly important for us to take a clear stand for justice with black communities in this moment.
In fact, our communities have a long history of solidarity. It was the black-led Civil Rights and Black Power movements that paved the way for Asian Americans to gain increased access to education and employment, to challenge language-based discrimination, and for liberalization of immigration in 1965. When Asian people, like Long Guang Huang and the Quincy Four, were targets of police violence, the black community has always stood with us in demanding accountability. In Massachusetts, we've stood together to demand that construction sites be opened to workers of color, that teaching staff in the public schools reflect the cultures of our children, and that political districts be drawn to increase each community's opportunity for representation.
We commit to supporting and following the lead of black-led organizing to demand justice for police brutality and murders of black lives, and toward changing systems that perpetuate white supremacy. We will struggle sideby-side to transform these systems and build a better world.",3535
A lingering challenge for American and British universities: Sinophobia,"Aydin, Serkan",Others,2020-06-09,"The coronavirus pandemic is impacting every aspect of normal life, including higher education. Colleges and universities have been pushed into uncertainty as they are impelled to transform to online-only courses while struggling with many other issues, particularly in terms of finances.
International students are also suffering from pandemic issues. One can witness the financial struggle of international students here at the University of Leeds in the UK, especially in terms of accommodations, rent, food and other expenses. Support offered by universities includes providing hardship funds for students in financial difficulty. Universities are also providing pastoral and mental health support. Yet this seems not to be a permanent solution.
As the universities frenziedly discuss whether they can safely reopen their campuses, even sending most students encouraging messages about the possibility of returning in the fall, Notre Dame in the US became one of the first major universities in the country to announce detailed plans for bringing back students, saying it would put in effect 'a regimen of testing and contact tracing, put quarantine and isolation protocols in place and require students to maintain social distancing and wear masks in public.'
Even if universities reopen, will international students come to the UK and US? British universities fear that the loss of tens of thousands of Chinese students next year will lead to gaping holes in their budgets, after the survey by the British Council has found that only a quarter of those intending to study in the UK were still going ahead with their plans. According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency, the number of Chinese students studying at British universities rose above 120,000 for the first time last year, up from 89,000 in 2014-15. Their tuition fees are a key source of income.
There is a challenge for Chinese students coming to Western universities: rising Sinophobia. My PhD thesis elaborated on Islamophobia in the university context. Having carried out research through interviews, it concluded that media exerts an enormous impact on the rise of Islamophobia on campus. Now is also the time to talk about the Sinophobia and racism that re-emerged with media coverage of the coronavirus. The excessive coverage evokes Sinophobia and racism that have real, harmful consequences for current and future Chinese and Asian students in universities.
In the early days of the US response to the pandemic, President Donald Trump incessantly labeled COVID-19 'the Chinese virus.' 'This language from the most powerful individual in the world was the most dangerous example of scapegoating for political purposes,' says Gordon H. Chang, a professor of American history at Stanford University. The Daily Columbian Spectator reported that 'Chinese and Asian students have recently been the target of racist discrimination, including a hateful message in Butler Library – and the name tags of two Chinese students, which were affixed to a suite door to identify the residents living there, had been burned in late January in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.'
The global Sinophobia fueled by the media is of significant consequence. People use the coronavirus as an excuse to harass Asian university students and bully Asian children. Sinophobia killed a man in Australia, as bystanders refused to perform CPR, fearing that he might carry the disease.
Yinxuan Huang, a sociology research fellow at City University London who has been carrying out research among Chinese Christian communities in the UK during the coronavirus crisis, said: 'Almost all incidents they reported were associated with ‘maskaphobia,’' which is a fear of masks which then triggered racist attacks. 'Most of the victims – some got called ‘virus’ and others got shoved – were wearing masks when they were attacked.'
'Many Chinese students feel that the issue of the mask is the single biggest cultural shock they have ever experienced in the UK. They are now facing a dilemma and have to choose between two bad choices – insecurity (for coronavirus) and fear (for racism).'
Despite the fact that US lawmakers are encouraging major social media platforms – such as Facebook, Google and Twitter – to cooperate in promoting credible information about the virus outbreak, this seems to be ineffective. Universities and individual community members must also participate in efforts to curb misinformation and Sinophobia.
I loved learning about Chinese cuisine and banquets with my Chinese friends during my PhD time at the University of Leeds. I was infatuated with Asian hospitality and their contribution to academia here. The university holds a special Chinese New Year annual event. We, the international students, believe that the UK is a place that values tolerance, equality, diversity and rule of law.
The growing coronavirus-related racism is disturbing. As racial vilification will not end easily, American and British universities should consider taking measures to combat against Sinophobia on campuses and in dorms, as well as worrying about reopening and financial issues stemming from tuition fees.

Bigotry of pandemic era documented in poll: Half of Chinese Canadians say they've faced ethnic insults since COVID-19,None,Others,2020-06-22,"""Every day, I pray that you people die.""
That's just one example of the kind of insults and name-calling that half of Chinese Canadians say they have experienced since the coronavirus pandemic arrived in North America, according to a poll by Angus Reid Institute and the University of Alberta released Monday.
The survey results, taken from 516 Canadians who self-identify as ethnically Chinese, suggest just how commonplace racist behaviour against people of East Asian descent has become since the pandemic arrived in North America.
Forty-three per cent of respondents said they have been personally threatened or intimidated at least once, and 13 per cent said it happens frequently. Eight per cent of respondents said they have frequently been physically attacked by strangers.
Researchers from the university helped craft the questions in the survey, conducted June 15-18. The results have a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.
The goal was to collect data on how Chinese Canadians' experience has changed since the pandemic started dominating headlines, said Angus Reid Institute executive director Shachi Kurl.
""What has made the news and what we hear about tends to be the really overt, violent, more extreme examples"" of such prejudice, she said.
In Vancouver, a man pushed a 92-year-old man with dementia to the ground outside a convenience store while yelling racist insults about COVID-19. In another incident, a man punched a woman of Asian descent near a bus stop downtown and walked away.
Even Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, has been targeted. Conservative MP Derek Sloan questioned her loyalty to Canada in April, asking, is she ""working for Canada or working for China?""
""No doubt there would be some out there who say these are just isolated examples,"" said Kurl. ""This study really aims to measure the breadth and the scope and size of the issue - and now we have a sense of that.""
Six in 10 respondents said they have changed some aspect of their routine in order to avoid abuse, ""run-ins"" or ""unpleasant encounters"" since the pandemic was declared in Canada. Fifty per cent said they have been insulted or called names due to their ethnicity. One in three survey respondents said they have been made to feel like they posed a threat to the health and safety of others.
Of the people who participated in the survey, 44 per cent per cent were born in Canada, 22 per cent in China, 22 per cent in Hong Kong and three per cent from Taiwan. Ten per cent were born in another country.
Nearly 90 per cent of respondents said that being Canadian was an important part of their identity and that they love Canada and what it stands for. Yet a quarter said they feel like outsiders in their own country. Of those who were born in Canada, one in five said they felt like outsiders.
""These data shows us that everything from insults to a sense of othering, to being made to feel that somehow you're to blame for this - it's all part of what affects someone's psyche,"" said Kurl.
In a 2016 Angus Reid poll, about half of visible-minority respondents said they believe others see them as Canadians ""all the time."" Respondents in this most recent survey were asked the same question. Only 13 per cent said they feel this way.
A majority (64 per cent) of respondents said they believe North American news outlets have had a negative effect on Canadians' views of people of Chinese ethnicity.
""The whole point of taking measurement of this is we are no longer dealing with anecdotes. This is something that brings empirical data, that brings facts to what has been, up to this point, more of an anecdotal conversation,"" said Kurl. ""You can't argue with that.""
The survey, designed with help from University of Alberta researchers, also gave respondents a chance to share details from their experiences. Some of the anonymized responses were published in the report.
One person wrote, ""While walking on the streets in Kitsilano (Vancouver), a Caucasian man in his 30s said to me and my daughter, 'Every day, I pray that you people die.'""
Another wrote, ""I was at a local Loblaws in the queue to pay and a person behind me got too close. I requested that he back up to allow for social distancing and he stated, 'Shut up and go back to where you came from.'""
About 1.6 million people in Canada - 4.6 per cent of the population - identify as being ethnically Chinese, according to the 2016 census.
Kurl said she hopes even people who have not experienced anti-Asian discrimination personally will pay attention.
""It's happening under our roof. We have to clean it up.""",4633
America has a way to go to overcome systemic racism,"Lane, Kara",Others,2020-06-14,"Racism is still a major issue in today’s America, with bias based on skin color, race and perceived nationality.
Adding to this, and creating further division and complications, is the brutality from some of the people who are supposed to protect us: the police.
In 1967, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said, “Racial injustice is still the Negro’s burden and America’s shame.”
Most people today know what is no longer acceptable, but still it seems that every single day we read or hear examples of privileged white Americans endangering the lives of African American individuals.
A recent example was a white woman antagonizing an African American man trying to peacefully bird-watch in New York’s Central Park after he simply asked her to follow the rules and put a leash on her dog. After seeing the video, it was blatantly clear that a divide still exists between races, and that a racist white woman could exploit racist law enforcement and possibly get an innocent man killed. This is just one instance of many.
Currently, we are living through a pandemic that has been hard on all of us. But how about those who have been attacked in public for being Asian because of the twisted idea that every individual of Chinese — or even just Asian — descent is to blame for COVID-19? It is absolutely disgraceful and unacceptable, and it is unconscionable that Asian Americans are being targeted because of the stereotyping of a country. Perhaps this should not be surprising, however, as President Donald Trump labeled the novel coronavirus “the Chinese virus” and blamed the Chinese for the events that have unfolded.
According to The New York Times, a woman named Yuanyuan Zhu said “a middle-aged man started shouting at her while she was walking to her gym and then spat at her as she waited to cross the street.”
In February, according to PhillyVoice.com, a 16-year-old student was beaten and hospitalized in Los Angeles in what officials called “racial backlash,” caused by stereotypes surrounding the coronavirus. That website reported that a video had captured an Asian man in New York City “minding his own business before a bucket of water was dumped on him. He confronted and fought his attacker.” It also reported on a video showing a “possibly racially motivated attack” on an Asian couple by juveniles in a Philadelphia subway station.
Perhaps the hardest thing to accept is the racism and injustice within the police system. There are too many examples to mention — but the May 25 police killing of George Floyd is among the worst. African Americans are told, “As long as you follow the rules, do what you’re told, and stay out of trouble, you’ll be safe” — and then they witness their compliant friends and family being harmed and even killed by the police, our “protectors.”
Some would say that racism is not nearly as bad as it used to be and that America has come a long way. I completely agree; I find it amazing to see how much things have changed. But there is so much work still to be done.
Just because we have come so far does not mean we can ignore the obvious division and racism that still exist in America today. Change must continue to happen for the United States to truly be free and equal for every individual.
“We must face the hard fact that many Americans would like to have a nation which is a democracy for white Americans but simultaneously a dictatorship over black Americans,” King said. “We must face the fact that we still have much to do in the area of race relations.”
Again, that was in 1967.
Fifty-three years later, we still have much to do.

Lifeline provided in Manhattan's Chinatown,"Zhao, Xu",Others,2020-06-11,"NGOs rally round to ensure food deliveries to needy
Donald Hong, chairman of UA3, an NGO based in New York dedicated to serving the local Asian and Chinese population, painted a grim picture.
Speaking about a group of people living in the Chung Pak complex for senior citizens in Manhattan's Chinatown, he said, ""They have opened up every can they have in the house, trying to stretch them for another day or two.""
Since mid-March, UA3 has teamed up with the Trader Joe's grocery store chain, other NGOs and city officials to provide badly-needed food to these people. Hong described the supplies as a lifeline for the seniors.
""The problem they are facing is twofold. On the one hand, the seniors, who mostly have various ailments, are afraid to go out in case they become infected. On the other, they are frightened by all the racism that has bubbled to the surface since the pandemic hit this country,"" Hong said.
At the height of the coronavirus outbreak in New York City in March and April, when the death toll peaked at more than 800 within 24 hours, everyone - caregivers, attendants and even family members - stopped visiting the seniors.
Sam Wu, superintendent of the Chung Pak complex, said: ""The overwhelming majority of the more than 110 residents are in their 80s. We also have a handful of others in their 90s and a couple more who are over 100. Infirm, and sometimes immobile, they were cut off from food sources.""
Beatrice Chen, from Immigrant Social Services Inc, another NGO based in New York, quickly responded to the challenges seniors faced.
She and her colleagues mobilized a group of volunteers, who ensured that bags of fresh produce were delivered to the homes of those badly in need.
Chen said that at the start of the outbreak everywhere was closing - ""the butcher's around the corner, nearby Chinese supermarkets, neighborhood Chinese restaurants, centers for seniors and family associations"".
By mid-March even the pantries that catered to the city's poor had been closed. ""Some of them had still been serving meals. People went in and ate - that was obviously a large gathering. Many more (pantries) simply could not find enough people to help handle and serve food safely,"" Chen said.
""We started to realize all the logistical implications if we were to open a standard pantry, where people line up to get their food. Standing in line for half an hour not only exposes seniors to a greater risk of being infected, but also is physically and mentally exhausting,"" she added.
The Community First Food Pantry Program now delivers about 250 bags of groceries twice a week to the Chung Pak residents as well as others living in tenement buildings in Chinatown and the Lower East Side, where there are huge populations of seniors.
Referring to city councilwoman Margaret Chin, the daughter of Chinese immigrant parents, Chen said, ""Donald Hong approached Margaret who, thanks to her constituent services, really knows where these hard-to-reach people are.
""Every building has its own rules, and you cannot just drop off fresh produce that could rot and attract rats. We often have to go a day in advance to make sure that the tenants will be at home when we deliver. One thing the seniors really miss is meat.""
Every morning, a Trader Joe's truck carrying food arrived in Lower Manhattan, and the supplies were unloaded at 2 am.
Hong said: ""Think about 50 crates of bananas and 340 crates of eggs. We seemed to be the only pantry in Lower Manhattan dealing with fresh, perishable food, as we wanted to give people a familiar taste.""
All the food was sorted and stored at a 200-square-meter pantry owned by Chung Pak Local Development Corp, and previously occupied by a restaurant that closed due to the pandemic.
Severe damage
Charles Lai, executive director of Chung Pak LDC, who helped found the Museum of Chinese in America in New York in 1980, said, ""Only by joining hands can we possibly reach out to those who are in desperate need of help yet are hiding themselves out of fear.
""The damage our community has suffered, physically and economically, is much more severe than in most other communities. Why? Because we have a president who calls this virus the Chinese virus, and in doing so has repeatedly evoked the country's (United States) racist history, making it unsafe for us at a time when all Americans need to stand together.""
A report released by the New York Police Department shows that hate crimes and discrimination against Asian Americans have risen consistently in recent months. City officials and local NGOs suspect that such incidents are underreported.
A paper issued by two NGOs - the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and Chinese for Affirmative Action - said New York state has the second-highest number of cases of discrimination related to COVID-19, after California.
Hong, citing examples of Asian Americans being physically and verbally attacked on the New York Subway, said: ""Before COVID-19, 40 percent of the people we served at our Midtown pantry on 26th Street were Asian Americans. That proportion has dropped to below 10 percent, although we now have a line that stretches for three blocks. Members of our community are not coming.""
Lai, the executive director, said: ""The impact of COVID-19 was palpably felt here even before it landed on American shores. Back in late January, when we were preparing to celebrate Chinese New Year, people were already staying away from Chinatown and Chinese businesses. After the pandemic, Chinatown will be the last place that people choose to return to.""
Business closures mean lost jobs, sometimes for an entire family, and it is not uncommon for different generations of Chinese American families in Manhattan's Chinatown to run enterprises such as restaurants.
Early last month, CNN reported that about 147,000 Asian workers in New York state had filed for unemployment benefit in the past four weeks, a 6,900 percent rise over the same period last year. The number of such filings by white workers rose by 1,840 percent and among black workers by 1,260 percent.
Chen, from Immigrant Social Services Inc, said: ""I know people who have started rationing food among three generations of a family. Waiting for unemployment benefit - which takes months to apply for - and not knowing when they will get their jobs back, they are trying to make their food reserves last a bit longer.
""You don't really hear these stories, because they're not being told. People are also largely unaware of those who are being excluded from most federal, state and local funding resources.""
Some 1,200 meals a week are now being provided by UA3, supported by Trader Joe's and other sources. In addition to caring for seniors, the NGO provides a home for the deaf in New York and another building for the visually impaired.
Chi Loek, a UA3 board member, said: ""We are pushing to expand our services. Food insecurity is going to be with us not just for months, but for years, and will be compounded by other factors, such as housing. What we are doing right now is intended not as an emergency measure, but as a sustainable, long-term solution to a problem that might grow.""
With this in mind, UA3 last week moved its food pantry to Grand Street in Lower Manhattan, where it is expected to reach out to more people in need. The Chung Pak residents continue to be served.
Kathleen Tom-Lew, a third-generation Chinese born and raised in Chinatown, has been working as a volunteer at the Chung Pak pantry since March, and makes deliveries in the heart of Chinatown.
""Originally, we only wanted to serve the elderly, but then other tenants who were out of a job asked to be put on our list,"" said Tom-Lew, a co-founder of the New York nonprofit Chinatown Community Young Lions.
Hong and Loek from UA3 scouted Chinatown and other areas of New York to find restaurants serving Chinese food that met the NGO's standards.
""These restaurants are funded by the city to provide ready-made meals for our program. While the seniors have something that is friendly on the stomach, the money is being funneled to local Chinese businesses,"" he said.
Chen, reflecting on the situation in Chinatown since January, said: ""Citywide, we've never been considered a top priority when it comes to a time like this. Usually, there are other neighborhoods that are much worse-off than ours, but this is different. It's unprecedented.""
The lives of local Chinese Americans, including active participants in community work, have been lost during the pandemic, including that of Jean Lau Chin, an avid collector of oral histories in Chinatown.
Just two people from the Chung Pak complex - a 97-year-old woman and a 105-year-old man - have died since the outbreak, but neither from COVID-19.
According to an article in The New York Times in the middle of last month, one-third of all coronavirus deaths in the US had been reported among nursing home residents and workers.
Wu, the superintendent, said: ""Since early March, we have provided masks to everyone entering the building, including caregivers and volunteers. If anyone leaves the building and then re-enters, we give them a new mask. We also give them protective eyewear and thoroughly spray and disinfect everyone.""
Referring to the seniors, who have been told not to go outside, he said, ""We've gone out of our way to meet their needs and will continue to do so."" Tom-Lew, who has been joined by her entire family in volunteering to help the elderly in Chinatown, spoke of the heart-warming response she has received.
""Officially, we are supposed to limit our contact only to those we are delivering to, for obvious reasons. But people wanted to thank us for our kindness by giving us something in return, such as a water bottle. One lady, who is in her 70s and ethnically Chinese, even gave me packs of gum,"" she said.
""When the pandemic was raging in late March and early April, tenants would open the door slightly, allowing us to pass through the food bags. However, we often put the bags outside on the floor, knocked on the door and then walked away.
""Before we left the floor, we could hear the squeaky sound of a door opening, followed by a shout down the hallway of 'thank you'.""",10206
Virus gives unis chance to reset,None,Others,2020-06-09,"The COVID-19 pandemic presents universities with an opportunity to rediscover their real purpose. This appears to have been lost, at least at the undergraduate level, due in significant part to a self-destructive business model.
Australian universities have become dependent on the opiate of undergraduate students from overseas. A terrible spiral of needing more money to build more infrastructure to provide degree programs for overseas students has resulted in the destruction of the quality of undergraduate programs, and consequently the perceived worth of degrees earned by previous graduates. Two examples demonstrate the toxic state of affairs. One first-year course that regularly had a failure rate of 30 per cent; now, the lecturer needs the permission of the dean should she/he plan to fail more than 5 per cent. In another course, examination papers need to be handed out in advance so students can cope with the test. What, then, are overseas students paying for? Not a high-quality educational experience; so presumably it is the supposed cachet associated with an Australian university degree. How long before their home countries realise this investment is largely valueless? Meanwhile, the reputation of Australian universities sinks lower. We must restore the quality of the undergraduate educational experience. Initially, this may result in some reduction in income. However, all students - local and overseas - will benefit.

All the way with the USA
Peter Hartcher correctly warns us of the perils of following in America's footsteps (""Let's not copy a broken empire"", June 6-7 ).
Yet here in NSW, the Berejiklian government is bent on doing that very thing. The government's ability to act as a ""problem-solving mechanism"", which Hartcher points out as the crucial failure of American government, is continually diminished by the mania for privatisation. Once a service, such as public transport, is privatised, codes of conduct or regulatory bodies, the guardians of public interest, quickly fade in the face of economic imperatives.
This is the American way, and the Berejiklian government is bent on following it.

In NSW, we have a state challenge to the holding of a protest on health and violence grounds. No prizes for guessing the likely next round of major protests will be about climate.
The groundswell of distaste for government inaction and obfuscation, shown last year before the bushfires and the pandemic, is no doubt sitting in the minds of the Liberal and National parties and mining strategists. With BlackRock and its ilk appearing on the horizon, get ready for fossil fuel dinosaurs behaving badly.

I appeal to all fellow Australians to intervene rather than turn away whenever they see such attacks. The victims are also Australians.

"Biases you didn't know existed in the healthcare industry, and how they impact patients and medical professionals","Ettinger, Zoë",Others,2020-06-17,"Biases are forms of discrimination in which we hold unfair beliefs about an entire group of people. These biases can be conscious (explicit) or unconscious (implicit).
Business Insider spoke to Dr. Jasmine Marcelin, a doctor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and Dr. Chloë Fitzgerald, a researcher of implicit bias, to gain a greater understanding of bias in medicine.
Both explicit and implicit bias are prevalent in the medical field, and they can affect how patients of different races, genders, faiths, and sexualities are treated.
Due in part to biases, black women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women, according to the CDC.
Though there has been great progress in reducing explicit biases, implicit biases are much harder to tackle, and they take active participation to identify and eliminate. Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.
Biases are present in many human interactions. These typically unfair assumptions, which can encompass entire groups of people, affect how we feel about and treat members of other races, genders, faiths, weights, sexualities, and abilities. In healthcare, the effect of biases on patients can lead to dangerous consequences.
Explicit biases, or conscious biases, are easier to detect because they are overt, according to Dr. Chloë Fitzgerald, who co-authored Implicit bias in healthcare professionals: a systematic review, which was published in BMC Medical Ethics.
""If someone had explicit bias, they might say, 'Oh, you know, obese people just don't work as hard, or they're lazy,'"" Dr. Fitzgerald told Business Insider. However, ""if it was implicit, they might choose someone else over an obese person to do a task because they'll assume the obese person will be slower to do it,"" she said.
Dr. Jasmine Marcelin, who co-authored The Impact of Unconscious Bias in Healthcare: How to Recognize and Mitigate It in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, said a lower presence of minorities in the medical field perpetuates bias.
Dr. Fitzgerald and Dr. Marcelin identified ways biases affect the healthcare industry.
Explicit bias against diverse groups has led to extreme abuse within the medical profession, like the Tuskegee Syphilis Study conducted between 1932 and 1972.
The Tuskegee Syphilis Study was an experiment that spanned 40 years, starting in 1932. It involved 600 black men, 399 with syphilis, and 201 without the disease, to test the effects of untreated syphilis. The study was carried out without their consent, as researchers told the men that they were being treated for ""bad blood,"" a term used to describe several ailments, including syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. (In 1974, a $10 million settlement was reached out of court with the participants and their families, and in 1997, President Bill Clinton apologized to them on behalf of the country.)
""The Tuskegee study demonstrated how conscious bias, in this case manifested in the form of racism, led to the unethical treatment of black men that continues to have long- lasting effects on health equity and justice in today's society,"" Dr. Marcelin said.
Due in part to biases, black women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women, according to the CDC.
Dr. Fitzgerald said black women were historically abused by white doctors performing gynecological procedures on them without their consent. These doctors held the false belief that black women somehow experienced less pain.
The field of infectious diseases is also affected by implicit bias, according to Dr. Marcelin. She is passionate about reducing biases in the field of infectious disease.
""I definitely think from a pandemic standpoint there is a huge risk for minority groups who are affected. We have a lot of data that shows that the effects of systemic racism and bias on minority groups has led to worse outcomes in those groups,"" she said.
Black people are 2.4 times more likely to die from the coronavirus.
Data from AMP Research Lab revealed that there were 54.5 coronavirus-related deaths per 100,000 in America's black population, while there were 22.7 per 100,000 for America's white population.
Though these deaths can be attributed in part to the way systemic racism makes black people less likely to have access to healthy food, green spaces, and livable wages, they could also be a result of the biases black people experience in healthcare.
A review published in Academic Emergency Medicine compiled studies on implicit bias in healthcare professionals and found that a in a majority of studies, physicians showed an implicit preference for white patients.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention even released guidelines for healthcare professionals to ensure they are not allowing bias to influence their treatment of patients during the pandemic.
Biases can also affect how medical professionals treat their colleagues, and minority medical professionals face microaggressions.
Microagressions are brief but common negative verbal or non-verbal behaviors against minorities.
An example Dr. Marcelin gave of a microagression is from a YouTube video in which an Asian woman is running on a trail in California, and another jogger stops her and asks her where she's from. The woman responds that she is from California, but the other person says, ""No, but where are you from, from?"" This assumes that just because the woman is of Asian heritage, that she cannot be from the United States.
Dr. Marcelin shared that she herself has experienced bias in the workplace — from both patients and colleagues — as an African American female doctor.
Dr. Marcelin, not pictured, said, ""There are many times that I have walked into patient situations and they have assumed that I am not the one that's in charge, even after I have identified myself as being the attending. I've had other healthcare professionals barging in on me in the middle of talking with patients and completely ignoring my presence in the room with the patient. I've had patients who asked me to take out their trash.""
Minorities in the healthcare field often have to pay the ""minority tax"" at work, Dr. Marcelin added. That is, they expend extra time and effort trying to combat bias and educate others on the effects of bias, with no compensation for their work.
Many diseases have been historically examined in male bodies, with the assumption that the same diagnoses would apply to women.
Heart attacks, for example, can be experienced differently by women, and doctors have misdiagnosed women who've had them. ""Women can experience pain in heart attacks in quite different ways that don't fit what we often think of as the classic heart attack,"" said Dr. Fitzgerald.
Men are also affected by biases. They are less likely to be diagnosed with mental health issues since they present them differently, said Dr. Fitzgerald.
Depressed men may present as angry rather than sad, according to the University of Rochester Medical Center. It is also often harder for men with depression to get help, due to stereotypes of sadness as weakness in men.
Countries with low rates of obesity have biases against people who are obese.
Biases against the obese often discount genetic and health factors that affect weight.
""Stereotypes against the obese may manifest in a lack of effort to make a connection with the patient, spending less time in clinical interaction and ultimately less investigation of different diagnoses,'"" said Dr. Fitzgerald.
Though the medical field shares the same biases as the general population, some specialties, like pediatrics, display somewhat lower levels, said Dr. Fitzgerald.
A 2008 study found implicit biases in pediatrics to be slightly lower than biases towards adults. The authors cited that further research is required to assess the effect on quality of care.
LGBTQ populations experience disparities in physical and mental health outcomes due to biases, according to Dr. Marcelin's research.
""Stigma and bias (both conscious and unconscious) projected by medical professionals toward the LGBTQ population play a major role in perpetuating these disparities,"" wrote Dr. Marcelin.
In the medical field, ""there's a lack of LGBTQ mentorship, poor recognition of scholarship opportunities, and noninclusive or even hostile institutional climates,"" she wrote. Dr. Marcelin's research showed that LGBTQ junior physicians did not disclose their sexual identity on residency applications for fear of rejection.
Junior physicians in the field also reported that they did not disclose that they are gay to colleagues and supervisors for fear of rejection or poor evaluations.
Though the US population is relatively diverse, there is a low rate of diversity in the healthcare profession.
According to Dr. Marcelin's research, although the US population is 13% African American and 18% Hispanic, only 3% of full-time medical school faculty is African American and only 4% is Hispanic.
In medicine, high rates of diversity lead to excellence in treatment. Reducing biases is everyone's issue, said Dr. Marcelin.
""Diversity is better overall for everyone. So what needs to [change] is more white people, especially straight white men, who need to embrace the importance of diversity and inclusion and equity. Recognize why it's important to recognize the benefits and put in the effort to [make that change],"" said Dr. Marcelin.",9418
"Indian restaurant vandalised in US, racist graffiti written at site",None,Others,2020-06-24,"New York, June 24 (IANS) An Indian restaurant has been vandalised with racist graffiti written amid the devastation left by the attack in New Mexico state, according to media reports.
Local leaders and the community are rallying behind the Sikh-owned restaurant, India Palace, in Santa Fe, which suffered $100,000 in damages during the attack discovered on Monday, the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper reported.
Besides causing extensive damage to the restaurant, the vandals had written slogans in support of President Donald Trump and ""White Power"", and racist remarks like ""Go Home,"" according to the Santa Fe Reporter.
It said that the kitchen was completely made unusable, tables were overturned, glassware was smashed, wine racks were emptied, the statue of a ""goddess"" was beheaded and computers were stolen.
The restaurant had reopened only recently after being closed due to the COVID-19 restrictions.
Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham tweeted on Tuesday, ""We will not stand for such hatred in New Mexico."" She added that she had spoken to restaurant-owner Bajit Singh to ""let him know that our community is with him.""
Mayor Alan Webber described the vandalism a ""sickening and appalling"" hate crime and vowed, ""We will find whoever did it and punish them to the full extent of the law.""
He said, ""The Singhs are a long-standing Sikh family that has used its own resources to feed homeless Santa Feans through the goodness of their hearts. For them to be attacked this way breaks our hearts.""
The Singh family distributes free packages of food and sanitary products for homeless people in the area and these items were stolen during the attack, according to the Reporter.
The Reporter said that five fundraising campaigns have been launched to help the restaurant.
A 'GoFundMe' campaign by another restaurant Paper Dosa had raised more than $35,000, the New Mexican said.
One of the pictures of the graffiti posted on the Reporter's website was against the terrorist organisation Islamic State.
Because of their turbans, Sikhs are sometimes mistaken for Islamists or Iranian clergy who are represented in the media with turbans and are attacked.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations National Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper said in a statement, ""This disturbing hate attack once again demonstrates that growing white supremacy, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and racism target every minority community and must be challenged by people of all races, faiths and backgrounds.""",2485
Only White House's most fervent fans will swallow its China's-to-blame claims,None,Others,2020-06-09,"The number of complaints related to racial discrimination the human rights watchdog in New York City received from February to April was 20 times more than the same period last year, among which nearly half were from Asian Americans.
That is only the tip of the iceberg, as Asian Americans nationwide have encountered a surge in discrimination and racism. Even some Asian American doctors and nurses fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic on the front line in the US have been boycotted and insulted by patients.
For a long time, Asian Americans, particularly those successful, have been regarded as free riders of the US system, regardless of how hard they have worked to climb up the social ladder. They have been subject to the spite of jealousy as well as the long-rooted racism in US society toward Asians.
But what makes the discrimination they face even more egregious now is that it is being fueled and orchestrated by the US administration.
Even the Federal Bureau of Investigation has warned the dramatic increase of crimes against Asian Americans is because some people in the US have bought the administration's fabrication that the novel coronavirus is a Chinese threat.
It is no coincidence that after the US administration started referring to the novel coronavirus as the ""China virus"" in March violence against Asian Americans increased rapidly.
With many US officials unceasingly trying to portray China as the source of the troubles the US is experiencing, it is obvious that the US administration is willing to victimize some of its own citizens if it thinks that will get its own head off the spike of voter anger.
Although its now customary assertions that it is beyond reproach may be swallowed without demur by its hardcore supporters, the administration's falling approval ratings show that while it may be able to fool some of the people all of the time, many of its one-time adherents have now cottoned onto the fact that its divisive words and deeds are simply self-serving.
The mounting death toll from the pandemic in the US is not because the pathogen has Chinese characteristics but because the US administration has proved fatally incapable of responding to it. The anger displayed on the streets of US cities shows that not only do a lot of people want an end to the country's long history of racist killings, they also want the administration to be held accountable for its deadly ham-fisted handling of the pandemic.
It is fair to say that it is the US administration that has single-handedly transformed the public health emergency into a systemic social, political and economic crisis for the nation. That's quite an achievement. But not one to take any tweeted pride in.",2709
"The COVID-19 Pandemic Magnifies the Crisis of ""U.S.-Style Human Rights""",None,Others,2020-06-12,"Editor's Note: The China Society for Human Rights Studies on Thursday released an article titled ""The COVID-19 Pandemic Magnifies the Crisis of 'U.S.-Style Human Rights'."" Following is the full text:
The sudden and unexpected outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is the most serious global public health emergency that humanity has experienced since the end of World War II. It is also a ""big test of human rights conditions"" for all countries across the globe. The virus does not respect borders, nor is race or nationality relevant in the face of the disease. Given this, to honor our common commitment to human rights, governments of different countries are obliged to adopt scientific measures for the prevention and control of the virus and do their best to ensure the health and safety of their people. Nevertheless, the U.S. government's self-interested, short-sighted, inefficient, and irresponsible response to the pandemic has not only caused the tragedy in which about 2 million Americans became infected with the virus and more than 110,000 have died from it, but also caused the exposure and deterioration of the long-existing problems within the United States, such as a divisive society, the polarization between the rich and the poor, racial discrimination, and the inadequate protection of the rights and interests of vulnerable groups. This has led the American people into grave human rights disasters.
1. The U.S. Government's Ineffective Response to the Pandemic Leading to Human Rights Disasters
Being distracted, slack, and opinionated in the face of the pandemic, the United States Federal Government declared a national emergency on March 13, after tens of thousands of deaths had occurred. The pandemic statistics released by Johns Hopkins University in the United States showed that as of June 9 Eastern Standard Time (EST), there had been 1,971,302 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 111,620 deaths from the virus in the United States, with both figures significantly higher than those of other countries. For the United States, which
boasts the strongest economic and technological strength and the most abundant medical resources in the world, this is a sad irony.
Ignoring the Pandemic Warnings. According to the revisited timeline of the pandemic in the United States, which was released by The New York Times and Washington Post in April 2020, the U.S. government had repeatedly ignored the pandemic warnings and slacked off on pandemic control. In early January, the National Security Council (NSC) received intelligence reports predicting the spread of the virus in the United States. On January 29, Peter Navarro, Director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy at the White House, laid out in striking detail the potential risks of a coronavirus pandemic: as many as half a million deaths and trillions of dollars in economic losses. U.S. health officials and medical experts, such as Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, also repeatedly warned of the deadly pandemic in the United States. Unfortunately, the U.S. government ignored these warnings. Instead, it focused on controlling the spreading of information, restricted medical experts' freedom to release information on the pandemic to the public, and even published false information to mislead the public, such as calling the virus ""a flu"", claiming that the virus has low infection and fatality rates, and saying that ""One day it's like a miracle, it will disappear."" Under such circumstances, the ""golden window"" period for infectious disease prevention and control was wasted. Even then, many members of the U.S. Senate, including Richard Burr, who was the chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, were involved in insider trading scandals. They used their positions to understand the serious situation of the pandemic earlier, but they downplayed the risk of the pandemic in front of the public while selling a large number of stocks before the pandemic triggered a stock market crash. In this way, they had a ""perfect hedge"".
Prioritizing Capital Interests. The website of The New York Times reported on April 13, 2020, that the White House COVID-19 Response Working Group and the NSC jointly prepared a memo dated February 14, which was titled ""U.S. Government Response to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus."" According to the report, the memo documented drastic pandemic-control measures including: ""significantly limiting public gatherings and cancellation of almost all sporting events, performances, and public and private meetings that cannot be convened by phone. Consider school closures."" Nevertheless, the decision-makers immediately rejected the memo after hearing that the measures would lead to the collapse of the U.S. stock market. This showed how the U.S. government prioritized capital interests and the response of the capital market, rather than making the people's right to life and health a priority. Due to this, the U.S. government failed to give effective warnings to the public and failed to get prepared for the potential consumption of medical resources caused by the pandemic, bringing the American people to the brink of infection and death.
Politicizing the Anti-pandemic Endeavor. When the virus broke out in the United States, some U.S. politicians used it as a weapon to attack political opponents and seek election benefits instead of regarding the drive to protect the lives and health of their people as their top priority. The website of The Lancet, an authoritative medical journal, published an editorial on May 16, which was a rare case for the journal. The editorial explicitly pointed out the intervention of political parties in the public health sector of the United States, and the weakening role of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It criticized the U.S. government for not actively adopting basic medical and anti-pandemic measures such as detection, tracking, and isolation, placing its hopes on ""magic bullets"" such as vaccines and new drugs, and hoping that the virus would eventually ""magically disappear"". On May 4, the famous U.S.political scientist Francis Fukuyama published the article The Wages of American Political Decay on the website The National Interest, pointing out that the highly polarized party politics made the political checks and balances an insurmountable obstacle to decision-making; that the pandemic, which should have been an opportunity to put aside differences and show unity, further deepened the political polarization. Politicians viewed the pandemic as an opportunity to seize power and partisan interests, and this came at the cost of the lives of countless American people.
Leading to Catastrophic Consequences. The website of The New York Times reported on May 20, 2020, that research by Columbia University of the United States showed that delays in adopting movement restrictions had caused at least 36,000 people to die. According to the research, if the U.S. government had adopted movement restrictions one week earlier, it could have saved 36,000 lives, and if the U.S. government had adopted movement restrictions two weeks earlier, 83 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 could have been avoided. On May 24, The New York Times unprecedentedly dedicated its entire front page to 1,000 U.S. COVID-19 victims. Their names,
ages, and brief descriptions were listed under the headline ""U.S. Deaths Near 100,000, an Incalculable Loss,"" with a subheadline reading: ""They Were Not Simply Names on a List. They Were Us."" The website of the Time reported on May 20 that the delayed social-distancing measures caused 90 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the United States, and observed that such a huge loss of life was essentially a failure of U.S. democracy.
2. Inequality within U.S. Society Being Fully Exposed during the Pandemic
In the United States, both liberal and conservative scholars agree on one basic fact that there is stark inequality within U.S. society. The deep-seated institutional reason for such inequality is that the U.S. government and political parties have long been manipulated by interest groups, and are unable to formulate and implement tax, industrial, and social security policies that promote social equality. During the pandemic, the social and economic inequality within U.S. society has been exposed and exacerbated.
The Elite Class of the United States Being Specially Treated in Coronavirus Testing. Viral infection does not distinguish between rich and poor, but the limited testing and medical resources were not fairly allocated in the United States. The website of The New York Times reported on March 19, 2020, that many dignitaries in the United States somehow underwent virus testing when they had no signs of infection and when nearly every state in the country lacked testing equipment. Uche Blackstock, an emergency medicine physician, said frustratedly, ""As a physician, I find it upsetting that celebrities and government officials without symptoms have been able to access testing quickly with same-day results, while I've had to ration out testing to my patients with turnaround times of five or seven days."" This obvious injustice has made the public increasingly raise questions. When medical staff and many patients cannot be diagnosed, whether the privileged class obtains priority testing means that the ordinary people are deprived of testing opportunities. The website of The Guardian, a British newspaper, published an article on March 21 and commented that when the Titanic hit the iceberg and sank, women and children were protected and rescued first, but in the face of COVID-19, the United States has first rescued the rich and powerful groups. The gap between rich and poor in getting the virus tests in the United States has exposed the slackness, confusion, and injustice in its pandemic prevention and control system.
People at the Bottom of U.S.Society Facing an Increasingly Dangerous Situation. The pandemic has made the lives of people at the bottom of U.S. society increasingly difficult, and further intensified the social polarization between rich and poor. According to a CBS report in 2019, nearly 40 percent of Americans would struggle to cover a $400 emergency expense, and 25 percent of Americans skipped necessary medical care because they could not afford the cost. The website of The Atlantic reported in April 2020 that low-income people in the United States would usually delay seeing a doctor when they became ill, not because they did not want to recover, but because they had no money at all. Faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, tens of millions of people in the United States are not covered by medical insurance, when intensive care for COVID-19 costs as high as tens of thousands of dollars in the country. ""To be or not to be"" is not just a philosophical proposition of some literary work, but a realistic choice that the people at the bottom of U.S. society have to make. Russia Today reported on April 30 that a Gallup survey revealed that one in seven American adults said that if they or their family members developed symptoms related to COVID-19, they would probably give up medical treatment because they were worried that they could not afford the costs. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, pointed out on April 16 that the poor in the United States were ""being hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic"". He observed, ""Low-income and poor people face far higher risks from the coronavirus due to chronic neglect and discrimination, and a muddled, corporate-driven federal response has failed them.""
High Unemployment Rates Leading the Working Class into a Crisis of Survival. According to data released by the U.S. Department of Labor on May 28, 2020, the cumulative number of Americans applying for unemployment relief from March 15 to May 23 has for the first time reached 40.8 million. Given the high unemployment rate brought about by the pandemic and the long-existing structural discrimination and polarization between rich and poor, the U.S. working class's ability to resist risks has greatly diminished. Vox News reported on April 10 that from the catering industry and tourism to the media industry, the entire U.S. economy has felt the impact of the pandemic, and just like the impact of other crises, the most vulnerable groups bore the brunt of the economic impact. According to the report, during the pandemic, the people who are most vulnerable amid layoffs are those who earn the lowest salaries, such as low-wage workers in the catering and retail industries. According to the report released
by the National Restaurant Association on April 20, two-thirds of restaurant workers (about 8 million people) have been dismissed or put on vacation due to the pandemic. When the U.S. government launched the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was intended to help small-and medium-sized enterprises, some large companies with sufficient funds took advantage of the rule loopholes to acquire huge loans, but small businesses and small shops that urgently needed loans to sustain themselves could not get the help. The above-mentioned report also showed that at least 60 percent of employers said that the existing relief plan of the federal government could not help them reduce layoffs. All this has revealed that the U.S. working class was the first to feel the pain of the economic recession brought about by the pandemic, and became the victims of the U.S. government's inefficient anti-pandemic measures.
3. Racial Discrimination Being Intensified within the United States during the Pandemic
The systemic racial discrimination is a chronic illness of U.S. society. Since 2016, white supremacy has revived and racial discrimination has intensified in the United States. Social tensions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially the unequal allocation of limited anti-pandemic resources, have further deepened mainstream society's discrimination against minorities, such as Asian, African, and Hispanic Americans.
Asian Americans Suffering from Stigmatization. The website of The Guardian, a British newspaper, pointed out on April 1, 2020 that stereotyping of Asian Americans still happens in the United States, and when reporting on the COVID-19 situation, some U.S. media always attach photos of Asian faces. The website of The New York Times observed on April 16 that the COVID-19 pandemic meant isolation for Asian Americans. Since the outbreak of the virus, Asian Americans have often been humiliated and even attacked in public places. Some U.S.politicians even deliberately misled the public. After the World Health Organization officially named the new coronavirus ""COVID- 19"", senior U.S. leaders, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, still insisted on referring to the virus as the ""Chinese virus"" or ""Wuhan virus"". They also refused to correct that mistake even after being strongly criticized by the international community. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Tendayi Achiume, pointed out on March 23 and April 21 that politicians of relevant countries proactively expressed xenophobic opinions or made xenophobic implications by deliberately replacing COVID-19 with other names that linked this particular disease to a particular country or nation, which was an irresponsible and disturbing expression. The current pandemic-related discrimination has fully exposed the once-concealed racial prejudice. In the United States, which bills itself as the ""beacon of freedom"", government officials blatantly incite, guide, and condone racial discrimination, which is tantamount to humiliating the modern concept of human rights.
African and Hispanic Americans Falling Victims to Severe Racial Inequality. Racial discrimination is deeply rooted in the history and reality of the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic has put this issue underneath a magnifying glass and tragically exposed its negative consequences. African Americans across the country are infected with and die from COVID-19 at a disproportionately higher rate than any other group in the United States. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) released a racial breakdown of the state's confirmed COVID- 19 cases and COVID-19 deaths on April 2, 2020, which showed that African Americans, who make up only 12 percent of Michigan's population, accounted for 33 percent of Michigan's confirmed COVID-19 cases and 40 percent of the state's COVID-19 deaths. National statistics released by the CDC showed that as of May 13, African Americans accounted for 22.4 percent of deaths from COVID-19 in the United States. This percentage is significantly higher than the African Americans'12.5 percent share of the total U.S.population. African Americans in Kansas, Illinois, and Missouri accounted for only 5.7 percent, 14.1 percent, and 11.6 percent of the total population of the states, respectively, but accounted for 29.7 percent, 30.3 percent, and 35.1 percent of these states' deaths from COVID-19.Hispanic Americans also have disproportionately higher infection and fatality rates during the pandemic. In early April, New York City released a racial breakdown of the city's deaths from COVID-19.According to it, Hispanic Americans accounted for 34 percent of the city's fatal cases of COVID-19. The website of The New York Times pointed out on April 14 that the fact the pandemic infected and killed African and Hispanic Americans at disproportionately higher rates was the result of a health gap directly created by the historical inequality of wealth and opportunities. The website of the Financial Times, a British newspaper, pointed out on May 15 that African Americans and Hispanic Americans were more likely than whites to perform the work that was necessary for the maintenance of social operations, making them more susceptible to poverty, diabetes, high blood pressure, and
COVID-19. The report also pointed out that this pandemic exacerbated the racial differences in the United States, and that nothing could better display the difference in skin color in the United States than the life and death stories in the pandemic shutdown. On May 25, George Floyd, an African-American man from Minnesota, died after a white police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes during his arrest. This led to large-scale protests and demonstrations across the United States, once again exposing the dissatisfaction and anger that the American people have for the worsening racial inequality.
Frequent Racist Violence. During the pandemic, racist violence has haunted the United States, and Asian Americans suffer from venomous personal attacks. From March 19 to April 1, 2020, alone, the U.S. nonprofit organization ""Stop AAPI Hate ""received more than 1,100 reports of hate incidents. In February 2020, a 16-year-old Asian boy in Los Angeles was accused of being a ""virus carrier"" and viciously beaten at school. On March 14, in a supermarket in Midland, Texas, a 19-year-old man deliberately stabbed an Asian man and his two young children with a knife on the ground that ""they were Chinese and were spreading the novel coronavirus to others."" On April 5, an Asian woman in Brooklyn, New York City, was attacked by a racist who spilled unidentified chemical liquid on her to severely burn her upper body, face, and hands when she was emptying rubbish at her door. Violent incidents have further exacerbated the social tension during the pandemic, and problems such as a divisive society, racial divide, and the proliferation of guns have worsened. On April 15, nearly 200 U.S. foreign policy scholars and former diplomats jointly issued a statement in USA Today, pointing out that hate crimes and violent attacks against Asian Americans sounded the alarm for the United States, and that leaders at all levels and in all sectors should take action to oppose racism against Asians and end hate crimes against Asian communities.
4. Vulnerable Groups in the United States Struggling to Survive during the Pandemic
The care for the survival of socially disadvantaged and marginalized groups represents the virtue of a society. It is also a touchstone for the human rights situation in a country. During the pandemic, the features of the United States' cruel capitalism have been fully exposed, which have forced the elderly, homeless people, and children into a tragic situation.
The Elderly, the ""Victims"" of the Government's Ineffectiveness in Fighting the Pandemic. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has repeatedly stressed that the elderly, like young people, have the same rights to life and health amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and no person is expendable. Unfortunately, during the epidemic in the United States, the elderly group, which is naturally at greater risk, has been further weakened and marginalized due to age discrimination, and the elderly's right to life has not been ensured. On March 23 and April 22,2020, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick expressed in interviews with Fox News that he would rather die than see public health measures damage the U.S. economy and take the risk of restarting the U.S. economy at the cost of elderly people's lives. Ben Shapiro, the editor-in-chief of The Daily Wire, which is a right-wing U.S. media outlet, declared coldly on an interview show on April 29, ""If somebody who is 81 dies of COVID-19, that is not the same thing as somebody who is 30 dying of COVID-19."" He also said, ""If grandma dies in a nursing home at age 81, and that's tragic and that's terrible, also the life expectancy in the United States is 80."" The website of The New York Times reported on May 11 that at least 28,100 occupants and staff members of long-term care institutions such as nursing homes in the United States have died of COVID-19, accounting for about one-third of COVID-19 deaths in the United States. In these care institutions, many elderly people live in a relatively closed environment, so their risk of death from COVID-19 infection is very high. The website of The Atlantic published two articles respectively on March 28 and April 29, titled Ageism Is Making the Pandemic Worse and We're Literally Killing Elders Now. They pointed out that long-existing defects in the old-age care system, such as insufficient capital investment and staffing, caused the United States to fall behind in ensuring the rights and interests of the elderly, and that such a situation was due to many political reasons. The website of the Washington Post observed on May 9 that the U.S. anti-pandemic action had become a state-approved massacre that deliberately sacrificed the lives of the elderly, the working class, African Americans, and Hispanic Americans.
The Homeless Having Nowhere to Go during the Pandemic. The website of USA Today reported on April 22, 2020, that more than 550,000 people were homeless every night in the United States. The report also pointed out that according to the statistics released by the Homeless Alliance, about 17 out of every 10,000 Americans have experienced homelessness and about 33 percent of them are families with children. Many of the homeless
Americans are elderly people and disabled people. Given their originally poor physical health and bad living and hygienic conditions, they are susceptible to the virus. During the epidemic, the homeless who are living on the streets are deported and forced to live in temporary shelters for isolation. The website of Reuters reported on April 23 that the crowded shelters made it impossible for the homeless who lived there to maintain social distance, which made it easier for the virus to spread. As of April 20, 43 homeless people living in New York City's shelters had died from infection of COVID-19, and 617 tested positive for COVID-19.The website of The New York Times reported on April 13 that the shelters for the homeless had become a delayed-action bomb of a virus outbreak in New York City, where more than 17,000 people lived and slept almost side by side in centralized shelters. The website of Nature journal reported on May 7 that when researchers began conducting virus testing on homeless people in the United States, they found that the situation there had gotten out of control. The website of the Boston Globe reported on May 4 that 596 homeless people in Boston had been diagnosed with COVID-19, accounting for one-third of the confirmed cases in the region.
The website of the Los Angeles Times reported on May 14 that research showed that due to the impact of the pandemic, the number of homeless people in the United States might surge by as much as 45 percent within a year, further exacerbating the public health crisis.
Worrisome Situation of Poor Children and Immigrant Children. The United States has not yet ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is one of the core international human rights conventions. In recent years, child poverty and abuse has remained a grave problem in the United States. This problem has been exacerbated by the pandemic. Forbes News reported on May 7, 2020 that a survey showed a large number of American children were facing hunger during the pandemic. As of the end of April, more than one-fifth of American households had been facing food crises, and two-fifths of American households with children under 12 years of age have been facing such crises. Forbes News reported on May 9 that the number of child exploitation reports in the United States surged during the pandemic. The National Center for Missing &Exploited Children received 4.2 million reports in April, an increase of 2 million from March 2020 and an increase of nearly 3 million from April 2019. Apart from that, a more worrisome fact is that a large number of unaccompanied immigrant children are still being held in detention centers in the United States. They are currently in an extremely dangerous situation during the pandemic. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights of migrants Felipe Gonzalez Morales and other UN human rights experts issued a joint statement on April 27, requesting the U.S. government to transfer immigrants from overcrowded and insanitary detention centers. On May 29, 15 experts of the Special Procedures of United Nations Human Rights Council issued a joint statement urging the United States to take more measures to prevent virus outbreaks in the detention centers. The website of the United Nations reported on May 21 that since March, the U.S. government had repatriated at least 1,000 unaccompanied immigrant children to Central and South America regardless of the risk of the pandemic. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) criticized this move, for it would expose the children to greater danger.
5. Relevant Behaviors of the U.S. Government Seriously Violating the Spirit of International Human Rights Law
When the citizens' right to life and health is severely threatened by the spreading pandemic, the U.S. government, instead of focusing on controlling the pandemic, wields a hegemonic stick and fans the flames of trouble everywhere, trying to divert attention and shirk responsibility. Its behaviors have seriously undermined the international community's concerted efforts to control the pandemic.
Ineffective Anti-pandemic Efforts Failing the National Duty of Ensuring the Citizens' Right to Life. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) stipulates that every human being has the inherent right to life, and countries are obliged to take proactive measures to guarantee their citizens' right to life. As a party to the convention, the U.S.government, however, has not given priority to its citizens' right to life and health during the pandemic. Instead, it has been prioritizing the political campaign at home and the political drive to suppress China abroad, rather than safeguarding the lives and safety of its citizens. Given this, it has missed the best chance to curb the spread of the virus, and caused a grave human rights disaster in which about 2 million people have been infected with COVID-19, and more than 110,000 have died from the virus. Clearly, the U.S. government has failed to fulfill its due national obligations to protect its people's lives from the threat of epidemics. The website of The Independent, a British newspaper, commented on April 10, 2020, that the United States, an active advocator for
human rights, ignored its own human rights obligations and blatantly overlooked its citizens' lives. The website of the Huffington Post reported on May 6 that after making a rigorous assessment of the U.S. government's poor performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, Yale University epidemiologist Gregg Gonsalves directly pointed out that this was getting awfully close to genocide by default.
Maliciously Stigmatizing China in Violation of the Principles of Equality and Non-discrimination. The principles of equality and nondiscrimination are the core norms of international human rights laws and are confirmed by a series of international human rights instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since the outbreak of the virus, high-ranking U.S. government officials have violently disregarded human conscience and ethical bottom lines. To maintain the U.S. hegemony, these officials have politicized the pandemic and constantly stigmatized China by referring to the virus as the ""Wuhan Virus"" or the ""China virus"".When the scientific community came to the conclusion that the exact source of the virus was from nature, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo still repeatedly claimed that the virus came from some lab in Wuhan according to some ""intelligence reports"" he read. These politicians' behaviors have clearly violated World Health Organization Best Practices for the Naming of New Human Infectious Diseases, which was jointly issued by the World Health Organization, the World Organization for Animal Health, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2015. The way they refer to the virus goes against the World Health Organization's suggestion for the official name of the novel coronavirus disease. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Tendayi Achiume, pointed out on March 23 that some U.S. government officials refused to use the internationally-recognized name of the virus and deliberately replaced it with other names that linked this particular disease to a particular country or nation, which was an irresponsible and disturbing expression that came from and would give rise to racism, xenophobia, stigmatization, and exclusion of certain groups, and violence against certain groups. She held that such behaviors were unforgivable and incompatible with the obligations stipulated by the international human rights laws.
Suspending the Payment of WHO Membership Fees Impeding the Joint Anti-Pandemic Efforts of the International Community. In order to shirk its responsibility for its disastrous anti-pandemic measures, the U.S. government tried to scapegoat the World Health Organization by fabricating false charges against the organization and threatening to stop paying its membership fees. On April 14, 2020, the U.S. government announced its suspension of paying dues to the WHO, which was unanimously criticized by the international community. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued a statement on April 14 stating that when the world was fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, it was inappropriate to reduce the resources required by the WHO or any other humanitarian organization for operations. The President of the American Medical Association, Patrice Harris, issued a statement on April 15 stating that combating the pandemic required international cooperation and that the suspension of financial support to the WHO at this critical moment is a dangerous step in the wrong direction. Josep Borrell, the European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, expressed on April 15 that at this time, there was no reason to justify such an action. On April 15, the website of The Guardian, a British newspaper, published an editorial and commented that when the world desperately needed to jointly overcome this threat that the world had never experienced before, the suspension of the WHO dues by the U.S.government was an act that lacked morality and disrupted the international order, and was a horrible betrayal to global solidarity. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on April 16 that the WHO was the mainstay of the global fight against the pandemic, and the suspension of the WHO dues by the United States at this time ""would be nothing other than throwing the pilot out of the plane in mid-flight"".Under such circumstances, the U.S.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo once again attacked the WHO on April 22, threatening to permanently suspend the payment of dues. On May 29, the president of the United States announced the suspension of relations with the WHO.
Unilateral Sanctions Violating the Spirit of Humanitarianism and the Principle of International Cooperation. International cooperation is the cornerstone of the existence and operation of the international community. It is an important principle for ensuring the implementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms across the globe. It is also a national obligation stipulated by international instruments, such as the Charter of the United Nations. At this critical moment when the deadly pandemic spreads globally and threatens human life, health, and well-being, all countries should work together to respond to the pandemic and maintain global public health security. Nevertheless, during this pandemic, the U.S. government has still imposed sanctions on countries such as Iran, Cuba, and Venezuela, which made it difficult for the sanctioned countries to obtain needed anti-pandemic medical
supplies in a timely manner, and posed threats to the people's rights to life and health in the sanctioned countries. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, expressed on March 24, 2020, that in the case of a global pandemic, sanctions would hinder medical work and increase risks for everyone. She argued that to maintain global public health security and protect the rights and lives of millions of people in sanctioned countries, sanctions should be relaxed or suspended in certain sectors. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, the Special Rapporteur on human rights for safe drinking water and sanitation, and the Special Rapporteur on the right to education issued a joint statement on May 6 stating that the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela were seriously harming the human rights of the people in the country. They urged the United States to immediately lift sanctions that exacerbated the suffering of the people when the pandemic raged in the country.",35233
2 organizations are working to revive NYC's Chinatown as it reels from the pandemic and racial stigma,"Chin, Kara; Kosciulek, Amelia; Abadi, Mark",Others,2020-08-05,"Businesses in Manhattan's Chinatown have been struggling to survive because of coronavirus-related restrictions and a racial
stigma against Asians in the US.
Chinatown small businesses reported losses between 60% to 80% in February and March.
Local organizations are helping them raise funds and set up temporary outdoor dining spaces.
View more episodes of Business Insider Today on Facebook.
Small businesses in Manhattan's Chinatown have survived weeklong closures following disasters like 9/11 and Hurricane
Sandy. But those hard times don't compare to the months of dwindling business the neighborhood is experiencing from the
coronavirus pandemic.
Chinatown small businesses report losses of 60% to 80% as early as February from a decline of customers that happened
before New York City's first confirmed COVID-19 case and the city's mandatory lockdown in March.
""Since there is a misunderstanding that the virus was brought to the US from China, a lot of people did not want to be in or
around Chinatown, or even eat Chinese food,"" said Chuen Ping Hui, owner and executive chef of Ping's seafood restaurant.
While New York recently lifted its restrictions on outdoor dining, Chinatown restaurants are still contending with a lack of
visitors.
""New York City now, it's quite clear that we no longer have the 66 million visitors from international tourism,"" said Wellington
Chen, executive director of Chinatown Partnership.
The organization helps maintain cleanliness and safety in the neighborhood, which are more necessary than ever.
""The demand on you is higher because of the additional cost of the shield, the masks, the sanitizers, the air filtration, HEPA
equipment that has never been in your formula,"" Chen said. ""And that's never in your budget, but meantime, your customers
are down this much.""
To attract customers, the nonprofit Chinatown Partnership has been helping Ping's and other local businesses set up outdoor
seating arrangements for the summer, in the form of collapsible tents, tables, chairs, and planters.
Ping's is one of the area's small businesses that operates on thin profit margins and relies on a steady stream of both locals
and tourists. When that stream dropped off in mid-March, Hui made a tough decision.
""Once March 15 came around, the business for March was down by 80%. I did not see a future,"" Hui said. ""Chinatown was
quiet. I had no choice but to [temporarily] close the business.""
After a three-month closure, Ping's reopened in early June with delivery and takeout service only. But the setup was less than
ideal for a fine-dining restaurant accustomed to serving as many as 150 people indoors. The restaurant added a small outdoor
space in late June, but it only fits around 20 diners, and it's often empty on weekdays.
Amid the pandemic and an economic downturn, Asian Americans are fighting racism and a stigma that they're to blame for the
virus.
In March, the FBI warned of a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans. And since March 19, the website Stop AAPI Hate
has received 2,373 anonymous incident reports of hate and discrimination toward Asians in the US.
The Stop AAPI Hate reporting center found that verbal harassment makes up 70% to 80% of the incidents and there's been a
rise in physical incidents, such as spitting or coughing on Asian people.
""We shifted really quickly from being 'crazy rich Asians' and the 'model minority' to being 'crazy infected Asians' and being the
perpetual foreigner,"" said Russell Jeung, founder of Stop AAPI Hate and chair of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State
University.
As Chinatown suffers, hate crimes against Asians are rising in the US.
President Donald Trump has reinforced the harmful racial stigma by saying ""Kung flu"" and ""China virus"" when referring to
COVID-19.
""The president's insistence on using the term 'Chinese virus' really makes the situation worse,"" Jeung said. ""We noticed that
after he began to repeatedly use that term, a clear spike in hate speech circulating on the internet and acts of violence against
Asian Americans.""
Chen, the Chinatown Partnership and Chinatown BID director, said the attacks threaten not just Chinese people, but all Asians.
""Unfortunately you have a ripple effect affecting Malaysians, Singaporeans, Vietnamese, people from the Philippines,"" he said.
""As long as you have an Asian face, you then become associated with this virus.""
The stigma has been detrimental to Asian American small businesses: 233,000 have closed across the country from February
to April, a loss of 28%.
To support small businesses in their neighborhood, Victoria Lee and Jennifer Tam started the grassroots organization Welcome
to Chinatown in March. The organization has several initiatives, including a partnership with small businesses to create and sell
merchandise, with revenue going directly back to the businesses.
""Chinatown doesn't need saving in the sense that there's an impassioned community,"" Lee said. ""We're only one of a handful
of different grassroots initiatives that have come out of the pandemic.""
One of its early fundraisers, Feed Our Heroes, involved purchasing meals from local eateries and delivering them to essential
workers. The group has served more than 16,000 meals in 11 weeks.
To extend assistance beyond food-related businesses, Welcome to Chinatown ended that program in June and recently
launched the Longevity Fund, a $200,000 fundraiser to alleviate overhead costs for 40 small local businesses.
""It's just really hard to see a time and place where Chinatown isn't where it was before in a post-COVID world,"" Tam said.
In the meantime, Chen is encouraging people to visit the neighborhood.
""Please come down here to show your support, whether by just your physical presence, buying a $1 item, or just walking
the street. It helps a lot,"" Chen said. ""Chinatown is, to the credit of everyone involved, very, very resilient. These are tough
fighters.""

"‘I feel scared and intimidated’: Coronavirus-inspired racism sows fear, anger in local Asian community","Choi, Hojun",Others,2020-08-01,"Hurt. Angry. Unsafe.
That's how Jasmine Yuan says she felt in March when a stranger in a car yelled “corona!” at her while driving by
in a grocery store parking lot in North Austin.
Yuan, 39, said she loves Austin and considers it a diverse, multicultural city, but lamented that she now fears
portions of town that used to be part of her everyday life. After the incident, Yuan said she has avoided public
places that she feels might put her at risk of being targeted again.
“I feel scared and intimidated. I just don’t want to have this experience happen again,” Yuan said.
Racist verbal and physical attacks have been reported at growing rates around the country since March,
according to people who have started tracking the trend nationally.
And local Asian American community leaders like Hugh Li, president of the education and philanthropy group
Austin Chinese American Network, fear anti-Asian attitudes tied to the coronavirus pandemic could stick around
long after the pandemic and worsen due to waning U.S.-China relations and economic hardship.
“I think this will naturally put Asian Americans, and particularly Chinese Americans, in a really bad bind,” he
said.
Li said his organization
recently circulated a survey asking its hundreds of members to report incidents of racism they have witnessed
or experienced during the pandemic, and it has so far have received two reports.
Yuan, who moved to the U.S. 13 years ago and has lived in Austin with her husband and two children since
2011, responded to the survey. She said she did not immediately report her experience at the grocery store,
hoping it had been an isolated incident.
“But if more and more of this happens, this becomes a trend,” Yuan said. “That makes me think that I need to
stand up and talk about this.”
Austin resident Jae Kwon, 35, who is Korean American, said he was the target of several aggressions that he
suspects were motivated by race.
Kwon, a University of Texas sociology doctoral student who has lived in Austin since 2015, said something was
thrown at him, a woman screamed something inaudible from a car, and a stranger yelled obscenities at him
during a six-day span in May while he was running for exercise. On another occasion, Kwon said a person
sprayed him with a water gun while driving by.
“It’s unusual in the sense that things like this had not happened other times,” said Kwon, who also served 12
years in the U.S. Navy. “I can only think that these are unrelated incidents, but it’s related in the sense that it
happened in this time period.”
G. Michael Pendon, 43, a local DJ, reported that a group of men harassed him using anti-Chinese and
homophobic slurs while he was riding a bicycle through a neighborhood near the UT campus July 18.
Pendon, whose parents came to the U.S. from the Philippines in the 1960s, said he could not sleep that night.
“I was pissed off. I was tired. I felt like I needed to go down there. I was kind of obsessed about trying to figure
this out,” he said.
Austin police have confirmed that they are investigating the matter. Pendon said he has also spoken to the UT
Police Department.
""I just want to identify these perpetrators,"" Pendon said.
Resurfacing biases
Experts in the field of Asian American history say racial violence and tensions during events like a pandemic are
not a new phenomenon.
Russell Jeung, chair of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University, said the pandemic has
reignited old, yet lingering anti-Asian sentiments in the West.
“There is a historical stereotype on Asians — the yellow peril — that they are a threat that would come dominate
the West with their hordes and their diseases,” Jeung said.
Jeung helped start Stop AAPI Hate, an online system in which people across the country can report racially
charged incidents against Asian Americans through a form translated into more than 10 languages.
“We launched it, and immediately we got flooded with responses, and using the data we’ve been sharing it
with local jurisdictions,” Jeung said.
Jeung said that, from March 19 through July 1, the organization received more than 2,120 reports of racially
motivated attacks against Asian Americans from across the country.
In more than 500 cases, Jeung said people reported being told to go back to China. One respondent from
Austin said they were told to go back to their country by a person who used a racial epithet to describe the
coronavirus.
A relatively small number of cases — 63 incidents — were from Texas, but reports came from every major
Texas city. About 22% of those reports involved physical attacks, more than double the national rate, Jeung
said. About 63% of reported attacks in Texas were verbal.
People of Chinese descent are not the only segment of the Asian American population targeted since the
pandemic started. On March 14, three people of Burmese descent, including 2- and 6-year-old children, were
attacked in the West Texas city of Midland by a man with a knife.
Jeung said Trump's rhetoric on China makes Asian Americans more vulnerable to racist attacks.
According to Factba.se, an independent online database of words from Trump’s speeches, media interviews
and tweets, the president used the term “China Virus” or “Chinese Virus” a total of eight times between
March and April, not including instances in which he blamed China for the pandemic without using those
terms.
In July alone, the database showed that Trump used different variations of the phrase at least 32 times.
""Trump makes the connection that the virus is Chinese, but he also normalizes the hate,"" Jeung said.
Jeung said the news media's framing of discussions and depictions of the pandemic, especially in its early
days, also has eroded the image of the Asian community in the country.
In addition to referring to the pathogen as the “Wuhan Virus,” many news organizations frequently ran clips
and images of people of East Asian descent wearing face masks, Jeung said.
“We all have implicit biases, and we have fight or flight responses,” Jeung said. “During the pandemic people
are fearful, and when they’re fearful, they automatically respond.”
A local group called the Austin Asian Community Health Initiative in May started a reporting system for
pandemic-related racist aggressions, and is working with Austin Public Health to track the data. Though the
organization has not yet received any local reports, Executive Director Hailey Easley said she believes the tool
will be useful in tracking racism well after the pandemic.
“I actually see this opening up,” Easley said. “I imagine that this could be helpful beyond COVID-19, and it
could be helpful for people of all ethnicities and all races.”
Local response
Amy Wong Mok, an established activist in the local Asian community, has been informing Mayor Steve Adler
and Austin Police Chief Brian Manley about racist incidents she has heard about.

In March, Mok, along with representatives from the Asian American Quality of Life Advisory
Commission, alerted city officials about rising anti-Asian racism amid the pandemic.
Mok said she heard multiple accounts of people being verbally harassed in March, and more recently,
reported that an Asian food supply company had three of its trucks vandalized.
Mok said she will continue to push city leaders to raise awareness and investigate reported incidents.
“No matter how long we’ve been here, no matter how much we contribute to society, we’re still
viewed as outsiders,” Mok said.
The Austin City Council in April unanimously passed a resolution condemning racism and hate speech
against Asian Americans.
Adler told the American-Statesman that city officials will continue working to address anti-Asian
racism in the city.
“Austin is no place for hate. We will continue to do all we can — in every way we can — to help make
sure that all our neighbors feel safe,” Adler said in a written statement. “We can’t prevent all this
behavior but we can shine light on it, condemn and make clear it is not tolerated in Austin.”
Alice Yi, president of the Austin chapter of the Asian Pacific Islander American Public Affairs, said
political participation can fight the stereotype that Asian Americans are perpetual foreigners.
Yi said her organization is working to get more people registered to vote in the November elections
and has helped people in the Asian American community fill out the 2020 census.
“If we have a huge amount of representation, maybe we cannot be scapegoated so easily,” Yi said. “If
we have a larger head count, we might have more representation politically and have more power to
speak out and speak louder.”

Epidemic of hate as attacks on Asian Americans grow,"Robinson, Belinda",Others,2020-08-10,"Four prominent Asian Americans says prejudice, racism and physical attacks against their community have
increased at alarming rates over assertions that Chinese people are responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Whenever there is a contentious relationship with any part of Asia from the United States, the racism inside the
United States goes up against Asians,"" said Jerry Yang, co-founder and former chief executive of Yahoo! ""We are
at such a moment, in my belief.""
Yang made his remarks at a virtual event organized by the National Committee on United States-China Relations
on Wednesday. He was joined by Anla Cheng, founder and chief executive of SupChina; Erika Lee, a professor of
American history and director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota; and
Nancy Yao Maasbach, president of the Museum of Chinese in America.
Between March and June 2,100 anti-Asian American hate crimes related to COVID-19 were committed, Chinese
advocacy groups say, 10 percent of them physical.
In Brooklyn, New York, a Chinese American woman, 89, was set on fire by two men. The woman had just left
her home on July 14 when the men slapped her in the face and set her clothes on fire. She was able to rub her
back against a wall to put out the flames but suffered burns.
""The pain I felt for that 89-year-old woman,"" Maasbach said. ""I am angry. But we need to use and channel that anger into better educating others. We need to own our identity the way we should.""
In another attack, an Asian American, 16, was attacked at school in San Fernando Valley, California, after being
accused of having the coronavirus. He suffered a concussion and was taken to the hospital.
""What's happening (to Asians) today, of course, has long historical roots,"" Lee said. ""It is certainly, as Jerry
mentioned, in relationship to what is happening on a global scale in terms of the rising tension between the US
and China, but also the pandemic has revived longstanding racist anti-immigration narratives.

Epidemic of hate as attacks on Asian Americans grow,"Robinson, Belinda",Others,2020-08-10,"Four prominent Asian Americans says prejudice, racism and physical attacks against their community have
increased at alarming rates over assertions that Chinese people are responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Whenever there is a contentious relationship with any part of Asia from the United States, the racism inside the
United States goes up against Asians,"" said Jerry Yang, co-founder and former chief executive of Yahoo! ""We are
at such a moment, in my belief.""
Yang made his remarks at a virtual event organized by the National Committee on United States-China Relations
on Wednesday. He was joined by Anla Cheng, founder and chief executive of SupChina; Erika Lee, a professor of
American history and director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota; and
Nancy Yao Maasbach, president of the Museum of Chinese in America.
Between March and June 2,100 anti-Asian American hate crimes related to COVID-19 were committed, Chinese
advocacy groups say, 10 percent of them physical.
In Brooklyn, New York, a Chinese American woman, 89, was set on fire by two men. The woman had just left
her home on July 14 when the men slapped her in the face and set her clothes on fire. She was able to rub her
back against a wall to put out the flames but suffered burns.
""The pain I felt for that 89-year-old woman,"" Maasbach said. ""I am angry. But we need to use and channel that anger into better educating others. We need to own our identity the way we should.""
In another attack, an Asian American, 16, was attacked at school in San Fernando Valley, California, after being
accused of having the coronavirus. He suffered a concussion and was taken to the hospital.
""What's happening (to Asians) today, of course, has long historical roots,"" Lee said. ""It is certainly, as Jerry
mentioned, in relationship to what is happening on a global scale in terms of the rising tension between the US
and China, but also the pandemic has revived longstanding racist anti-immigration narratives.

Being a Chinese student in the US: ‘Neither the US nor China wants us’,None,Others,2020-08-04,"By Zhaoyin Feng BBC Chinese Service, Washington
BBC.COM- Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US-China relationship is now at one of it lowest points in
years
Stranded abroad by the coronavirus pandemic and squeezed by political tensions, Chinese students in the United States
are rethinking their host and home countries.
Eight years ago, Shizheng Tie, then aged 13, moved alone from China to rural Ohio for one sole purpose: education. She
once had a budding American dream, but now she says she is facing hostility in that country.
“As a Chinese living in the US, I am very scared now,” she says. Tie, now a senior student at Johns Hopkins University,
describes America as “anti-China” and “chaotic”.
Some 360,000 Chinese students are currently enrolled in schools in the US. In the past months, they have experienced
two historical events – a global pandemic and unprecedented tensions between the US and China, which have reshaped
their views of the two nations.
‘Politicised’ and ‘anxious’
The majority of Chinese students in the US are self-funded and hope their western education will lead to a good career.
Meanwhile, Washington has warned that not all students from China are “normal”, claiming some are Beijing’s proxies
who conduct economic espionage, orchestrate pro-China views and monitor other Chinese students on American campuses.
The Trump administration recently cancelled visas for 3,000 students they believe have ties to the Chinese military. One
US senator even suggested that Chinese nationals should be banned from studying math and science in America.
Amid the harsh rhetoric, many Chinese students fear that they are being turned into a political target for Washington.
Tie, majoring in environmental science, says she is pessimistic about her academic future in the US, given the growing
scrutiny over Chinese students and scholars in science and technology.
“I used to think I’d pursue my PhD in the US and perhaps settle down here, but now I see myself returning to China
after obtaining a master’s degree,” Tie says.
Yingyi Ma, associate professor of sociology at Syracuse University, says Chinese students in the US are now “politicised
and marginalised at an unprecedented level”, as Washington is sending “very unfriendly signals”.
The strained bilateral relations have swayed public opinion, as a recent survey found that 73% of American adults have
an unfavourable view of China – an historic high.
Prof Ma published a book called Ambitious and Anxious this January, focusing on Chinese students’ experience in
America.
“If I write the book now, I will only keep ‘anxious’ in the title,” she says.
‘Unwanted’ at home
As the coronavirus continues to spread in the US, Tie prefers to return to China, where the outbreak appears to be
largely under control.
But the country has ordered sharp cuts in international flights to prevent imported cases, leaving many Chinese students
overseas, stranded thousands of miles away from their families.
On Chinese social media, some comments portrayed these students as spoiled brats, who had fled from the country’s
fiercely competitive education system and now may imperil its success in containing the virus.
“America wants to kick us out, while China doesn’t allow us to return,” Tie says.
This sentiment is commonly shared among Chinese students in the US.
Iris Li, a 20-year-old junior student from China at Emory University in Atlanta, describes the students as “being kicked
like a ball” between the two countries.
“We are getting the short end of the stick from both sides,” Li says.
Racism ‘boosts’ support for Beijing
After worrying about the outbreak in their home country from afar, these young Chinese are now witnessing the
coronavirus crisis in the US.
They were perplexed by the cultural differences regarding mask-wearing. They were unsettled by President Trump’s use
of the phrases “kung flu” and “China virus”. Some have even experienced racial harassment firsthand.
Racial discrimination during the pandemic has “burst their bubble,” Prof Ma says.
A new paper stated that anti-Chinese racism boosts support for Beijing’s authoritarian rule among Chinese students in
the US.
Jennifer Pan, co-author of the paper and assistant professor of Communications at Stanford University, says there is a
general belief that Chinese students overseas are indoctrinated to wholeheartedly support the Chinese Communist
Party.
“That’s not the case,” Prof Pan says, “What does change their political views is racism.”
The research found that college freshmen from China who read derogatory comments against Chinese people are
more likely to support Beijing, while general criticism against the government’s coronavirus handling did not produce
the same effects.
Prof Pan says the findings suggest that Chinese students in the US, whose survey responses are “mature,
sophisticated and thoughtful for their age”, can rationally process criticism against China.
Rethinking China and America
Despite her frustration over China’s travel restrictions, Tie says she has become more patriotic since living aboard.
“I had believed America to be a wonderland of dreams, equality and tolerance for all. I certainly don’t believe it
anymore,” she wrote in her school newspaper in June, criticising America’s “Sinophobia”.
In February, she penned an online petition, protesting against her university hosting a panel with Hong Kong
democracy activists.
But Tie says she’s not a “little pink”, a somewhat disparaging term for nationalistic Chinese youth active on the
internet.
“I am patriotic in a rational way, not as a result of brainwashing,” Tie says, adding that she views both Washington
and Beijing critically, citing the lack of freedom of speech in China.
“Both countries let me down many times,” Tie says, “but China is my motherland, so I am more willing to endure that
frustration.”
Similar to Tie, Li plans to return to China after her study, with transformed understandings of her home and host
countries.
In early July, Washington announced a policy barring foreign students from staying in the country, but the decision
was rescinded after receiving waves of criticism.
“It made me feel hopeful about the US,” Li says, “This would not happen in China.”
The sociology and religious studies student thinks the pandemic has laid bare the advantages and weaknesses of both
political systems. While the Chinese government seems to act more effectively, the US allows dissent, and at times, it
is able to correct its own mistakes.
American education has made her “more anti-China,” Li says with a laugh.

students of visas if all their courses were online
She recalls feeling “very uncomfortable” when she first arrived in America six years ago and saw her fellow students
waving Taiwanese flags, which are seen in mainland China as a symbol for Taiwan independence.
But after getting to know the Taiwanese students, she realised that though their views may have been completely
different, they could discuss issues respectfully, which is encouraged in American classrooms.
“Studying in the US is an important experience in my life,” one that she says she’d never regret. “But I am eager to
help change China, where my work may be more meaningful.”

Case may combine rare hate-crime charge with insanity defense,"Schneider, Doug",Others,2020-08-11,"FOND DU LAC - The case against a man charged with killing a retired police officer by hitting him with his pickup
truck could combine two rare elements in a Wisconsin court case: a hate-crime charge and an insanity defense.
Prosecutors say the killing of retired police officer Phillip A. Thiessen, 55, of Fond du Lac is a hate crime becauseThiessen was targeted because of his race — Thiessen was white and defendant Daniel Navarro, a Mexican-
American, told police he intended to kill a white person.Statements Navarro is accused of making to police immediately after the crash — unless his attorney can get a
judge to throw them out — would likely eliminate several potential defenses.
""Navarro stated he intentionally crashed into the motorcycle, head-on,"" District Attorney Eric Toney said in a
criminal complaint. Fond du Lac County Sheriff's Sgt. Logan Will, who spoke with Navarro minutes after the July
3 crash, said Navarro told him, ""It was intentional, sir.""
Navarro's truck left no skid marks or other signs he tried to avoid Thiessen before a head-on collision on
Winnebago Drive in Taycheedah, the complaint says. There is no evidence the two knew each other before the
crash.
Prosecutors also say Navarro said white people had been harassing him, ""giving him acid"" and contaminated
him with a chemical sterilizer.
Navarro, 27, is charged with first-degree intentional homicide with a deadly weapon as a hate crime, and first-
degree recklessly endangering safety with a dangerous weapon, as a hate crime. He is in Fond du Lac CountyJail in lieu of $1 million bond.
Navarro is due in county circuit court on Wednesday for arraignment.
The law since 1988
Hate-crimes — crimes motivated by bigotry — became illegal under a measure the state Legislature adopted in
1988.
Then Rep. David Clarenbach, D-Madison, authored the bill after incidents including cross burnings, the painting
of a swastika on a synagogue and the killing of a white woman walking in a mall parking lot with a Black man,
according to a 1988 report in the Janesville Gazette.
""If a man is assaulted because he is Black,"" Clarenbach said, ""the penalty for assault should be enhanced to
reflect the intimidation connected with the crime.""
Hate crimes ""enhancers,"" as they are known, allow increased fines and prison time for crimes that target people
because of race and ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, disability or gender. A judge can add up to $5,000,
and/or an additional five years in prison to the sentence of someone convicted of a hate-crime felony.
Race and ethnicity remain the most common reasons for hate crimes in the state, and in the nation, statistics
show.
Nationally, the FBI says, Blacks were the targets of 1,943 hate crimes in 2018 — more than any other race,
figures show. Next are whites, at 762, and Latinos, at 485.
Perhaps the state's best-known hate crime is the August 2012 mass shooting at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in
Oak Creek, near Milwaukee. A white supremacist killed six people, including four priests, and wounded four
others before killing himself after being shot by an Oak Creek police officer.
Another victim, paralyzed in the attack, died earlier this year.
Today, though, Wisconsin's hate-crime cases remain fairly rare, U.S. Justice Department figures show.
Since 2014, when 51 were reported, the numbers declined for two years, then nudged back up to 46 in 2017,
and rose again to 53 in 2018, the most recent year for which figures were available.
Hate crimes, insanity defense
When he spoke to deputies at the crash scene, and detectives later that night, Navarro told sheriff's officials he
hadn't nodded off at the wheel. Nor did he claim Thiessen was riding in a way that would have caused Navarro
to think he needed to defend himself against the motorcyclist, based on what witnesses told police.
That limits his options in terms of a criminal defense, meaning his best defense might involve employing an
""insanity defense"" — making the case about his mental condition.
That approach — pleading not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, commonly labeled an ""insanity
defense"" or ""NGI"" — is available, but rarely used. Black's Law Dictionary says it's employed in less than 1% of
Wisconsin criminal cases.
Defense Attorney Jeffrey Jensen wasn't available for comment but had indicated after a brief court proceeding in
July that he might consider a defense based on Navarro's mental health.
In an insanity defense, the defendant must admit he or she committed the crime. A defense attorney must then convince the court that his client couldn't understand his actions were wrong, and couldn't stop himself from
committing the crime.
The defense could also convince a court the defendant knew his actions were wrong but couldn't ""conform his
conduct to the law"" — something Marquette University Law Professor Michael O'Hear called ""the irresistible
impulse.""
At trial, both sides will call expert witnesses who've examined the defendant. The defense's expert will likely
testify that the defendant should be found not guilty because of his mental condition and the prosecution's
will disagree.
Even then, a successful insanity defense won't necessarily keep a defendant from being locked up for a long
time. Defendants who are found guilty, but not responsible, are typically confined to a psychiatric institution,
not released into the community or sent to prison. And in Wisconsin cases where a jury accepts an insanity
defense, a judge can reject that finding.
Kenneth Freeman of Milwaukee was found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect this year for killing
Froedtert Hospital nurse practitioner Carlie Beaudin, 33, as she walked to her car after a 2019 shift at the
hospital. A judge in Milwaukee County sentenced Freeman in March to spend the rest of his life in a secure
mental facility.
Wisconsin's best known — and perhaps only — hate-crime case to employ an insanity defense resulted in
three life sentences plus 20 years for a Milwaukee County man who gunned down neighbors Phia and Mai Vue
and Jesus Manso-Perez, and tried to kill a fourth in a racially motivated attack. Jurors rejected Dan Popp's
claim that mental illness kept him from acting lawfully.
Insanity-defense cases usually involve testimony about the defendant's mental health over time. Should
Navarro employ such a defense, it could pose challenges.
As USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reported in July, Navarro's family, a prosecutor, and a judge had raised
concerns in the past about Navarro's mental state. But while multiple people raised red flags, there was little
immediate evidence that he had undergone an evaluation.
His sister in 2019 had described him to Fond du Lac police as a germophobe who wouldn't pick something up
without paper towels or toilet paper in his hands. Another relative told authorities a doctor had recommendedhe have a mental health evaluation. And the Fond du Lac County circuit judge overseeing his 2019 disorderly-
conduct case had ordered a psychological evaluation.But when one a test was not conducted in the time called for under law, the judge released Navarro from jail
and withdrew the order.

Recent Wisconsin hate crimes
Wisconsin has seen some hate-driven crimes of violence recently. Some exhibit an element of pre-planning.
Milwaukee resident Clifton Blackwell, 62, is set for trial in November on a felony charge of first-degree
reckless injury as a hate crime. Prosecutors say he threw acid in the face of 42-year-old U.S. citizen Mahud
Villalaz outside a Milwaukee restaurant last fall after making anti-immigrant remarks and accusing Villalaz of
""invading"" the U.S.
Villalaz suffered facial burns. He has recovered.
In late June, 18-year-old Althea Bernstein told Madison police she was approached at a light by four white
men; she said one sprayed her with a flammable liquid. Bernstein, who is biracial, said a man threw a lit
match or lighter at her, briefly setting her face and neck on fire, the Associated Press reported.
City police and the FBI are investigating that as a possible hate crime. At least $15,000 in reward money
has been posted for information leading to the capture of a suspect.
Small city hate crimes
Hate crimes aren't just a big city problem in Wisconsin.
In June, Marathon County prosecutors charged Aaron Nielson, 51, of Wausau, with misdemeanor battery
and disorderly conduct, after an attack on a biracial man outside a Wausau convenience store. Joseph
Murphy, who is Menominee Indian and Black, said Nielson scuffled with him after approaching and uttering
racial slurs. Witnesses confirmed Murphy's account.
In May, a Stevens Point man was accused of a hate crime in connection with the verbal harassment of
Asian-Americans at a Point grocery store. Police told Wisconsin Public Radio that harassment of the local
Hmong population has increased since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic earlier this year.
Also, someone in February 2019 posted a racist, anti-Islamic slur on a building housing a La Crosse taxicab
company run by Mike Ahmad, a Muslim. The graffiti included a common anti-Black slur.
Some charges don't stick
Not all Wisconsin cases charged as hate crimes result in hate-crime convictions.
A former De Pere man who initially was accused of a hate crime after yelling a racial slur and shooting at a
man in downtown Green Bay in 2017 was convicted of two felonies and a misdemeanor. The hate crime
enhancer was withdrawn after authorities agreed that the slur was more likely the result of the defendant's
intoxication.
Daniel Navarro, 27, appears by webcam during his initial court appearance on Thursday, July 9, in Fond du
Lac County Circuit Court.

"ONLY IN THE AJC COPING WITH CORONAVIRUS: The unique challenge in Atlanta's Chinatown: Amid COVID-19, financial struggles are often complicated by politics.",Liuyu Ivy Chen,Others,2020-08-30,"'It's impossible to go on like this,"" said Lirong Ma, 67, speaking Mandarin with a lilting northeastern Chinese accent -- she hails from
Harbin. ""Even if I don't get the virus, I'd sooner or later go mad!""
For months, her custom tailor shop has had little business, and she has struggled to pay the bills. Worse still, she was told that if she
couldn't pay this month's rent, she'd be evicted or pay extra the following month. The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan she had
applied for with the help of an agent was only a temporary Band-Aid. She feels that all her effort coming to America looks increasingly
like a bubble about to burst.
Lirong Ma's designer clothing store is one of three dozen businesses in Atlanta's Chinatown. Standing quietly near the old freight tracks
in Chamblee, this Chinatown is not exactly a town, but a small strip mall with beige walls, green roof tiles, and red signage. Opened on
Aug. 8, 1988, it was said to be the first Chinese commercial center in the southeastern U.S. Two stone lions guard its front entrance.
Chinese immigrants began to arrive in Atlanta in significant numbers after the U.S. immigration law was revised in 1965, a fruit of the
civil rights movement. Jimmy Carter, a former Georgia farmer and governor and the 39th president of the United States, formally
normalized diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1979, heralding a new era of China's economic boom and U.S.-
China exchanges.
Four decades later, however, it would not be an exaggeration to say that U.S.-China relations are hitting a new low. Lately, the two
countries' top leaders have played tit-for-tat in trade wars and each has recently closed consulates in the other's country. President
Donald Trump has blamed China for letting the coronavirus pandemic get out of control, and the administration has imposed visa
restrictions for foreign workers and international students. Most recently, Trump signed two executive orders to ban Tik-Tok, a popular
video-sharing social networking service, and WeChat, the most widely used messaging app among the Chinese.
Many Chinese living in the United States find themselves stuck in the middle of this U.S.-China rivalry in the time of COVID-19, quietly
coping with financial distress, visa restrictions, racial discrimination, public health fears and crises of personal identity.
I grew up in mainland China in the 1990s and 2000s, and first heard about Atlanta when it hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics. Since I
moved to Atlanta in 2016, I've regularly swum in the pool used for the Olympics, and sported a Carter-Mondale bumper sticker on the
rear of my 1976 vintage car.
About twice a month, I drive my light-yellow diesel car from my home in Midtown to Buford Highway. I pass a small airport, a vibrant
Latino neighborhood, a few Buddhist temples, a MARTA station, and arrive at the Chinatown on New Peachtree Road. Lately, new
developments with a Ponce City Market vibe are sprouting nearby.
I go there to find niche cooking ingredients and affordable packaged food at Dinho Supermarket, grab a bite in the food court, and chat
with different store owners. Unlike the sprawling Chinatowns in New York or San Francisco, Atlanta Chinatown's quiet space, small
garden, and friendly air put me at ease. When I walk through the crammed aisles and smell shampoo and soap, I remember my
childhood.
'Responsibility
to serve my community' Since it bears the name Chinatown -- the one and only in metro Atlanta -- Chamblee Chinatown remains the
destination for many Chinese newcomers. A store owner once told me that when Hurricane Irma hit Florida in 2017, many displaced
Chinese families drove north, searched for Chinatown, and arrived here, where the shop owners sheltered and fed them. Chinese people
from Kentucky, Tennessee and other neighboring states also make seasonal pilgrimages to Atlanta Chinatown, curing their homesickness
with trunkloads of goods.
While the name Chinatown brings Chinese people together in times of need, it has also become a target for racial alienation.
""Because of the sign Chinatown on top of our building, people stopped coming here as early as late January, when Wuhan just entered
lockdown but America was still business as usual,"" one female shop owner, who wished to withhold her name fearing further alienation,
told me. ""They don't know that many who work here are not Chinese, don't speak any Chinese, and have never been to China.""
Although this woman's shop is on the brink of bankruptcy, what she fears more is publicity. ""I know my business is suffering, but I feel
very, very tired. I just want to protect my family at this moment, and don't want to invite any more attention."" A single mother, she
spoke gently but resolutely. At the end of May, a small group of protesters came to Atlanta Chinatown to boycott the Chinese businesses.
One protester carried a gun. This left her and the Chinese community shaken.
Yet she does what she can to help those less fortunate. She has set up a food counter in the corner of her shop for homeless people to
take canned food, toothbrushes, toilet paper and other daily necessities.
""When homeless people come by, none of them take more than they need, even when I offer more,"" she recalled with light in her eyes.
""Perhaps I do feel a responsibility to serve my community.""
Restaurants hit hard Dinho Supermarket, standing since 1988 and now run by a couple from Beijing, is doing all right, with customers
stocking up on groceries to shelter indoors. The gregarious beauty stylist from Malaysia who owns International Hair Design also oozes
optimism -- she has won over enough customers in the past 30 years to sail through this crisis. Spencer Chang, a senior CPA originally
from Taiwan, has also maintained a steady clientele.
""Chinese people live frugally, have good saving habits, and quickly adapt to new situations, which helps to cope with unexpected
disasters,"" Chang said in his office recently. ""We are also very cautious; we started wearing masks from the beginning. Of course, it's a
difficult time for everyone, especially restaurant owners. But overall, we are likely to weather the economic downturn from the pandemic.
Among hundreds of my clients, only one of them has gone bankrupt due to COVID-19.""
When I visited in late July, Chang's firm was busy as usual; 10 young employees wearing masks typed away at their desks.
Yet just a few steps away, things were different. At least two restaurants were closed. Food stalls, bakeries, tailor and gift shops have
taken the harshest blow of the pandemic. These business owners, many of them new immigrants, expressed financial woes and
frustration over what they saw as America's inadequate measures to curb the pandemic.
Jane Chung opened Family Baking just a little over a year ago. Inside the chic and minimalist shop, freshly baked buns, luscious
desserts, decorated cakes, and a variety of cold drinks sit neatly on the shelves and in the fridge. Milk tea and coffee can be ordered at
the counter. Chung was just about to launch a marketing campaign and expand her store when COVID-19 hit, cutting her ambitions
short. Since walk-in customers are very few now, Chung relies on takeout orders and struggles to pay her workers.
Chung looked anxious but radiated energy. She had been working for 16-hour days that week. ""It's been very difficult for us. Life was so
good before the pandemic! I really hope American people could work together to contain the pandemic. If America is ill, we Chinese
Americans won't be well.""
As I stood to leave, Chung offered to give me a free milk tea. I insisted on paying. The Hong Kong-style milk tea with boba and ice
tasted delicious.
In the atrium of the building, a traditional Chinese garden breathes under a placid square of sky. On a normal weekend, children jump
up and down on the small red bridge to marvel at the red carp swimming in the pond beneath, adults play Chinese chess on the stone
tables, and seniors stroll along the low wall painted with the Great Wall. But it is mostly empty now. The carp swim without an
audience. A row of stone tables provides outdoor seating for cautious diners.
Inside the food court (mask required), six food vendors (one closed) continue to serve a rich selection of fusion dishes, including
roasted duck, pork chop with Peking sauce, fried chicken, sweet and sour bass, hot and sour soup, mapo tofu, and hand-pulled
noodles. It smells like Asian street food with a tinge of American and Mexican flair.
Guijie Zhang is the owner of the Sichuan food vendor I frequent. Her husband, the chef, works behind the curtain in the kitchen.
""We were closed for two months, but the landlord ordered us to open in late May, so that we can keep paying the rent,"" said Zhang.
She had laid off the previous workers and hesitated to hire new ones for fear of further exposure and financial burden. The PPP loan
she'd received only helped for two months. She and her husband now toil without a salary.
Zhang told me that her restaurant orders had gone down 70%, but the prices of ingredients had spiked. Before COVID-19, she
normally had about 140 orders on a Saturday; now, less than 50. Before, a crate of string beans was around $20; now, over $40.
""But we can't raise the price on our menu. We mainly serve lower-income customers; it's a difficult time for everyone,"" Zhang said,
lowering her eyes.
In the dining area shared by all the vendors, about five or six customers dined sparsely at lunchtime on a recent Thursday. Two large
metal fans kept the air in the space well circulated.
Originally from Hebei, Zhang came to Atlanta four years ago to join her husband. ""In the beginning, I struggled a lot. But over time,
I've grown to like this country more and more. People here are very nice and simple, with good hearts, unlike the hyper-competitive
culture in mainland China.""
Zhang sees America mainly through the lens of her customers -- nearby employees and residents, including many who are African
American, Hispanic, Southeast Asian, and Chinese students.
""Who knows when this pandemic will end,"" Zhang said. ""Luckily, people are much more cautious now. My customers are very good at
wearing masks and social distancing. We'll just have to wait and see when God guides us back to a normal life.""
""Are you a Christian?"" I asked, surprised at this discovery. Religion is discouraged in mainland China.
""Yes, I joined my husband's church when I first arrived. After taking some Bible-study classes, I felt, well, it's better to have faith.""
While I was talking to her, a white customer came over to order bubble tea. Zhang struggled with her English. I offered to help. The
customer explained patiently. We all leaned closer while standing apart, trying to understand each other through layers of accents,
masks, and a plastic shield in front of the cashier.
Struggling to fit in -- and survive
Outside the food court and to the left, I saw racks of traditional Chinese qipao in bright colors standing in the middle of the corridor,
directing my attention to Ms. Ma Custom Tailor. The shop has richly embroidered traditional Chinese gowns covering the walls andboldly designed robes, skirts, coats and pants hanging on the racks. Baby outfits and hats made from dyed silk are particularly eye-
catching. Yet no customer was browsing when I visited recently.""It's very difficult to do business in America. I worked extremely hard over the past four years and earned a good reputation,"" the
owner, Ma, said.
""But all the money I made has gone to paying taxes. In America, all you do is pay taxes! And now, the virus."" Ma shook her head
while sewing a yellow summer dress, squinting her bleary eyes.
Before coming to America, Ma was a well-known fashion designer in China with 40 years of experience. To support her son as a single
mother, she had brought 70 yuan (about $10) to start her career in Shenyang, later running a successful clothing factory and two
storefronts.
""For over 20 years, I didn't need to touch the sewing machine,"" Ma said with pride mixed with remorse. ""My three dozen workers
pedaled for me. But in America, I can't afford to hire anyone. I have to do everything myself, starting from scratch."" She cut the white
threads.
In 2016, Ma came to Atlanta for a fashion design competition and stayed on an O-1 Visa (a nonimmigrant visa for individuals with
extraordinary ability or achievement). Her business back home was subsequently closed. Her family members remain in China.
""There was no other tailor in Atlanta who could design a decent traditional Chinese gown. I wanted to start a trend,"" Ma laughed,
pressing her knotted fingers on the yellow dress. When she first arrived, she could not speak any English or drive. When she finally
got behind the wheel, she could not see the signs well and often lost her way.
Four years later, Ma still cannot speak much English and drives with great caution. A thicket of linguistic, cultural and legal brambles
stands between her and her idea of America, misunderstandings being the daily casualties of her American dream.
I couldn't help but arrive at the conclusion that Ma would be much better off in China. Though earlier immigrants fled famines, wars
and political disasters, today's China provides unprecedented comfort and stability -- if one avoids politics.
Ma seemed to have guessed what I was thinking. ""I know, life is so much better in China. I miss my son and my grandson every
day. But I can't go back like this. I need to set a good example for my kids.""
Plus, in the time of COVID-19 and U.S.-China dissension, it is increasingly difficult to secure a plane ticket, get customs clearance,
and go through the isolating quarantine periods.
""I'm only in my 60s; I can still work! I'll be terribly bored if I go back to live with my son,"" Ma reassured herself.
As I soon found out, Ma is not alone in America anymore. This past February, she got married. Her husband Ronald is a retired
police officer and African American pastor. She made the wedding gown herself, white with lace.
Language remains a barrier between the husband and wife. When talking to her husband, Ma uses a translation app, which often
makes mistakes.
""He often looks at me with tears in his eyes, searching for any sign of misunderstanding,"" Ma said with a shy smile. ""He keeps
telling me to say more, ask questions, and double-check the translation.""
She often reminds herself, her Chinese family and her American friends that she and Ronald vowed to stay together for better or
worse, rich or poor.
As I stood to leave, a well-dressed man with a sweet smile and a strong build showed up. He was Ronald. I beamed. ""Your wife is a
force of nature,"" I said.
""Yes, she is a remarkable woman,"" Ronald said, eyes gleaming. ""I feel very blessed every day. Last year, I prayed to God for a
woman in my life. And you know what? A few months later, I met her.""
""Did you come to pick her up today?""
""Every single day."" His smile widened. ""It's my duty to escort my lady home.""
""I bet you are a good driver!"" And we laughed.

Workers should know their employment rights during COVID-19,"Dolan, Christopher; Collado, Mari Bandoma",Others,2020-12-17,"This week's question comes from Elena in Dolores Heights, San Francisco, who asks: My child's day care had to
close for a month due to COVID-19 exposure. I took time off from work to take care of my 4-year-old. When I
returned to work, my coworkers began treating me differently. They know about what happened at my child's
day care. When I walk in a room, I see them whispering to each other and/or they leave the room altogether, as
if to avoid me. One coworker specifically asked me if I had the ""kung-flu."" I am Asian American and I was
offended by this comment. Another coworker said that it wasn't fair that I got to take a ""month-long vacation,"" I
verbally complained to my manager about the racist remark and being treated differently by my coworkers and
she assured me that she would take care of it.
A couple of weeks later, my manager told me that I was being transferred to the graveyard shift. My manager
knows that I cannot work that shift because I have a young child I told her that this was not fair and that I
thought I was being retaliated against for taking time off because of a COVID-19 closure of my child's day care
and/or complaining about my coworkers'racist remarks. She denied it and said that it was a business need, and
that my options are switching to the graveyard shift or quitting. I believe she is singling me out. I have been
working for this company for two years and have always had a great relationship with my manager prior to my
complaints. I don't know what to do. What are my rights?
Dear Elena: I'm so sorry that this is happening to you in the midst of what already is such a difficult year. The
Fair Employment and Housing Act prohibits discrimination and harassment based on race, national origin and disability (among others) in the workplace. The FEHA applies to public and private employers, labor
organizations and employment agencies with five or more employees. Employees also have the right to be
protected from retaliation for making a complaint or opposing a practice prohibited by the FEHA. Retaliation
includes any adverse employment action taken in response to an employee's complaint, including termination,
demotion, pay reduction, job transfer and negative performance evaluation. In other words, your employer
cannot punish you or treat you differently if you report race, national-origin or disability-based discrimination or
harassment in the workplace. Employers who violate the FEHA's anti-discrimination, harassment and retaliation
provisions may be liable for damages including back pay, lost benefits, emotional distress, punitive damages,
attorneys' fees and costs, etc.
Your complaint to your manager regarding the ""kung-flu"" comment made by your coworker and being treated
differently by coworkers due to taking leave of absence are considered a protected activity under the FEHA as it
is likely based on your race or national origin or as a perceived or associational disability. (COVID-19 can be a
disability, depending on how severe.) Your manager forcing you to transfer to the graveyard shift would be
considered an adverse employment action under the FEHA. The law requires proving a connection between
these two things. The fact that this happened just two weeks after your complaint is some evidence that it is
related to the protected activity.
Another source of protection may come from the Family First Coronavirus Response Act. The FFCRA, which
expanded the Family Medical Leave Act, covers leave and loss of income when an employee needs to care for
children because of school or childcare closure and other leave related to COVID-19. Employers with 500 or
fewer employees are required to provide job-protected leave for employees who are unable to work (or
telework) due to a need to care for the employee's child (under the age of 18) if the child's elementary or
secondary school or place of childcare has been closed, or the childcare provider is unavailable due to the
COVID-19 emergency. This applies to employees who have been employed by the employer for at least 30
calendar days. This means that employers are prohibited from discharging, disciplining, or otherwise retaliating
against any employee who takes leave under the FFCRA. Employers who violate the FFCRA's expanded FMLA
provision may be liable for damages including back pay, lost benefits, emotional distress, attorneys' fees and
costs, etc.
Assuming your employment has 500 or fewer employees, your leave of absence to take care of your minor child
during the daycare closure is protected by the FFCRA and retaliating against you with a transfer to a graveyard
shift is in violation of the FFCRA. We recommend that you contact an employment attorney to best protect your
rights and to ensure that you do not miss any filing deadlines.

Anti-Chinese racism the other side of pandemic,"Zhu, Lia",Others,2020-12-29,"After reviewing my interview notes for the whole year, I find one word that sticks out - racism. I have listened to
the stories of many members from the Chinese community since COVID-19 began spreading in the United
States early this year and Asian Americans first reported facing racial bias.
Closing the notebook, I saw three faces in my mind's eye - they are filled with confusion, frustration and fear.
Never more fearful
Julie Tang had been a judge at the San Francisco Superior Court for 26 years. The person who understands
more of self-protection than average people said she was ""happy sheltering in my little condominium ""because
she did not want to risk being spit upon or told to go back to China.
Though racial prejudice is not new to the Chinese immigrant who has lived in the US for 50 years, Tang said she
has never felt more fearful for her personal safety than now.
""I just don't want to confront it now because this is a very scary time. It is like going back to a war where you
can be shot at,"" she said. ""When racism rears its ugly head, we don't know if we can protect ourselves or our
family.""
Some of my friends told me they sympathize with the fear of the retired judge even though they have not
experienced any incident yet.
A friend said she has been relying on online grocery delivery since March just to avoid any potential racist
incident.
Firsthand experience
Simon is a student of biology from China at the University of Texas' MD Anderson Cancer Center. When he was
shunned on the street while wearing a mask in March, he was not sure if the act was racist until he read the
news about rising racism against Asians.
One of the first violent racist attacks related to COVID-19 happened on March 14 in Midland, Texas. Three Asian
American family members, including a 2-year-old and a 6-year-old, were stabbed because the suspect thought
the family ""infected people with the coronavirus"".
For the first time in his life, Simon, who preferred to be called by first name only, said he searched the internet
for tips on how to respond to racist attacks.
""I think you would not understand the feeling of being discriminated against until you have experienced it
yourself,"" he said.
Finding support online
Elaine Peng is a mental health advocate and educator in the Bay Area.
What aggravates the challenges that the pandemic has already posed for her service recipients is the US
government's attempted ban on WeChat.
The Chinese social networking app is like a lifeline for those who need her assistance, said Peng, because all
their support groups are on WeChat and it is the only Chinese language communication app available in the US.
""I think the WeChat ban is targeting our Chinese communities. It's used to continue the government's racist
agenda,"" Peng said.
She has since joined organizing efforts to raise awareness of anti-Asian racism, such as inviting elected officials
and community members to speak up at online meetings and signing petitions to protest anti-China rhetoric.
During a recent phone call, Simon told me he would stay and continue his study in the US, despite the pandemic
and other challenges.
""As they say, a crisis brings out both the best and the worst in people. I'm glad to see there also are a lot of
people who believe in equality and stand against racism,"" he said.

"In Oldest Chinatown, The Future Looks Foggy: In San Fran., tourism has plunged and so has business.",Jada Chin WASHINGTON POST,Others,2020-12-01,"The oldest Chinatown in the United States is starting to resemble a ghost town. Red lanterns swinging above the pagodas are
reminiscent of tumbleweed. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, tourism has declined drastically, leaving beloved businesses
questioning their future.
San Francisco's Chinatown, a historic neighborhood that has been a beacon for immigrants and the ""American dream,"" has faced racial
discrimination, repressive legislation, a massive earthquake, and now a pandemic - one of the greatest tests of this resilient
neighborhood's more than century-long existence.
It is in this situation where Orlando Kuan finds himself, on a metal folding chair next to a crowded table of pastries outside his
storefront on a Sunday afternoon, frequently known to be the busiest day for business. Grant Avenue, a once-bustling street in San
Francisco's Chinatown, is devoid of tourists. Only the most loyal locals are left to patronize their favorite family-owned businesses.
Eastern Bakery, a cornerstone of the neighborhood, first opened its doors in 1924, and it became the oldest bakery in Chinatown. But
business has slowed to a crawl. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, typically one of the busiest times of year, the bakery logged a 70%
drop in sales, according to Kuan.
Still, he continues to personally greet customers - who once included President Bill Clinton - marveling at his table of famous lotus
mooncakes and coffee crunch cake, a traditional recipe that is a big seller.
In March, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a stay-home order, which restricted nonessential travel, affecting 40 million
Californians. In July, he called for statewide closures for dine-in restaurants, bars, movie theaters, and family entertainment centers
such as bowling alleys, mini-golf facilities, and arcades.
Now, Portsmouth Square, Chinatown's living room, is devoid of the usual pack of Chinatown residents who come to the park to mingle,
practice Tai Chi, and play checkers.
According to the San Francisco Travel Association, tourism to the city has been slashed in half, and tourist spending has plunged by
nearly 70% this year.
""As early as January 2020, we were already starting to see an impact. This was during a period when Chinatown generates a bulk of
revenue. There was a one-third drop in attendance for the Lunar New Year parade, which was economically devastating,"" said Malcolm
Yeung, executive director of the Chinatown Community Development Center. ""This was definitely behind the racist rhetoric around the
coronavirus.""
Yeung is referring to the impact on the Asian American community after President Donald Trump's use of xenophobic language in an
effort to place blame on China for the spread of the virus. ""Thank you all for being here, and we continue our relentless effort to defeat
the Chinese virus,"" the president said to a pool of reporters in March.
Businesses such as Eastern Bakery are not the only ones struggling to stay afloat. Man Hing, a Chinese Arts and Crafts store, also
based on Grant Avenue, is going out of business. Owner Eddie Au said that the pandemic is not the only reason for closing after 54
years at the shop. ""The economy isn't good, and Chinatown will take three to four years to recover,"" Au said.
Eighty percent of his customers are tourists originating from Europe or Mexico, he said. With the economy collapsing, Au saw his
opportunity to close up shop and retire.
Chinatown Alleyway Tours, a program from the Chinatown Community Development Center, has gotten innovative. The youth-led and
-designed program consisted of a historical tour of the Chinatown neighborhood and alleyways, and it featured groups as large as 15
to 20 people.
Lisa Yu, senior community organizer at Chinatown Community Development Center, said, ""Our in-person tours stopped in March, but
we plan to do Minecraft virtual tours next year.""
The virtual tours, built and designed by the high school youth leaders, are still in production and are being tested internally.
To empower the community and keep spirit alive, the neighborhood is trying to adapt to a changed world. The Chinese Culture Center
partnered with 100 Days of Action, Project Artivism and the Chinatown Visitor Information Center in an initiative called Art for
Essential Workers to liven up the area, with murals painted by Asian American artists on boarded-up storefronts.
""Chinatown is such a rich community, living, breathing, and depending on tourists. It's an economic engine tied to tourism - for people
afar,"" said Jenny Leung, the executive director of the Chinese Culture Center.
The challenges have not let up. This month, San Francisco Mayor London Breed, a Democrat, rolled back the reopening of indoor
dining because of a spike in coronavirus cases. The changes have affected a variety of businesses and kept the future of tourism in the
city foggy.
Among those hit hardest are banquet restaurants in Chinatown, which rely on the indoor dining experience.
R&G Lounge on Kearny Street celebrates Cantonese cuisine in a formal setting. Designed to bring families together, the dining rooms
are generally crammed with round marble tables to encourage family-style meals. At this restaurant on a recent evening, guests were
served a 9-inch cod dish and a simmering pot of winter melon soup next to the salt and pepper Dungeness crab, suitable for a party of
eight.
These banquet restaurants offer an intimate experience over a comforting meal, and frequent visitors say that without them,
Chinatown would not be the same.
By one untraditional metric of business, which might be dubbed the fortune cookie index, the slump has been severe. On an average
day, Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory would produce 5,000 to 8,000 fortune cookies, co-owner Kevin Chan said. After two months
of reopening, the company is making 3,000 a day or less.
The cookie factory is in Ross Alley, formerly a notorious center for brothels and gambling dens, where the usual snaking line of tourists
has disappeared. Chan's mother, fellow owner Nancy Tom Chan, is still delicately folding the individual fortune cookies there with her
son. The landmark business is celebrating its 58th anniversary with its biggest economic challenge to date.
""Tourism is the goose that lays the golden egg for San Francisco, whether it's service jobs or a convention for visitors,"" said Aaron
Peskin, a Democrat who represents District 3 on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. ""It's a multibillion-dollar industry, that San
Francisco, despite its challenges . . . has relied on.""

"Wasted Chances: It may not have started here, but the novel coronavirus became a US tragedy",None,Others,2020-12-16,"On Feb. 29, hundreds of people packed into the Pullman Christian Reformed Church, a squat, beige brick building on
Chicago's South Side. An attendee began the ceremonies by blasting a shofar, the trumpet made out of a ram's horn.
Somebody played keyboard. And a long line of people waited to speak into a microphone about their memories of Angeli
Demus. |The lifelong Chicagoan, who had died a month earlier at age 59, insisted she didn't want it called a funeral.
""Donate, cremate, celebrate,"" had been her credo to her family near the end of a gutting battle with lung cancer, and with
her eyes donated and her body cremated, all that was left was this party. |Her husband, Earl Demus, billed it as ""Angeli's
Joyous Celebration,"" and thought that the crowd it gathered spoke to his wife's beloved nature. ""Standing room only,""
recounted Demus, who estimated there were more than 450 people there. ""I stopped counting after a while.""
The disconcerting news story that seemed recently to creep into every conversation, particularly after it tanked the stock
market the previous week, didn't make it past the doors of the church. Nobody wore a mask or kept their distance, and for
the most part nobody even talked about the novel coronavirus. It had only started to trickle into the United States, as far
as anybody knew, and the few cases in Illinois were said to be isolated and controlled.
A top health official had a week earlier assured Chicagoans that ""the health risk to the general public from novel
coronavirus remains low,"" and the outlook from the highest levels of government was that, nationally, the few instances of
the virus were disappearing. President Donald Trump had said three days earlier there were 15 cases in the country, and
""the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.""
In a room off to the side of the church, people sipped soft drinks and picked at a spread catered by a neighborhood chef:
finger sandwiches, sliders, fruit and cheese, chicken and Angeli's favorite dessert, cheesecake. This room was where her
father, Charles Dungill, spent most of the event.
Everybody called him ""Cookie,"" a throwback to his days as a drummer in a family band that toured everywhere Black
performers were allowed in Jim Crow's America. Cookie shook hands, hugged and chatted with relatives and friends, some
of whom had traveled from California, Michigan, Georgia, Ohio and Nevada. A family friend was fresh off a golfing trip to
Arizona and another had recently returned from South Africa.
It was the West Chatham diaspora, a testament to the lasting bonds of the tight-knit Chicago neighborhood in which
Cookie and his wife, Barbara, had raised Angeli and her three surviving siblings: brothers Sevil and Kyann, and sister Gina.
A couple of days after the celebration at the church, Sevil stopped by Cookie's house to check on him. The kids were
worried about their dad. They'd noticed little changes in his appearance: a slight droop to his posture, something different
in his eyes.
It wasn't just his daughter's death with which he was reckoning. Barbara, his wife of 63 years, had died less than a week
before Angeli's celebration, after suffering from multiple ailments, including cancer.
But Sevil found his dad in good enough spirits, having enjoyed the event at Pullman so much that he wanted to plan the
same thing for Barbara. Father and son chatted for about three hours, during which Sevil noticed that his dad had a slight
hitch in his throat.
Probably post-nasal drip.
The next day after work, Sevil was driving back to his dad's house, bringing him Barbara's ashes from the crematorium,
when he realized: Now he had a little cough, too.
""You know, just a hee-mmh,"" Sevil later recalled.
***
Before the nearly 300,000 deaths, the widespread financial devastation, the isolation from loved ones and the fatigue of a
daily disaster with no clear end, there was this: A tickle in a throat in Chicago. A woman's sudden crash to the floor of her
kitchen in the Bay Area. A playwright in Manhattan with three-quarters of a lung left in his chest, sensing doom and fleeing
down the coast with his husband.
The virus shouldn't have been able to sneak up on the United States. The world's most powerful nation, historically among
the most successful at stymieing infectious illnesses, had ample lead time during which the deadly pandemic was
rampaging through Asia, and then Europe.
But in an early vacuum of leadership at almost every government level, with the message from the White House that the
virus was not anything to worry about, Americans unwittingly spread the lethal virus to loved ones and strangers alike.
The U.S. squandered its early advantage. Roughly one year after the virus first came into existence, the country has
suffered a loss of life far worse than any other.
Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and professor at Brown University, said COVID-19's traits made it a formidable
opponent for even those large nations most competent at fighting it.
But, she added, in the United States in 2020, the virus found an ideal victim. ""The virus could not have emerged at a
better time for spread than this year,"" Ranney said. ""We were in an election year. We had a president who didn't believe in
science. We had underfunding of our public health institutions. It was a perfect storm.""
In an effort to better understand how the virus exploited the country's strengths and exposed its weaknesses, USA TODAY
interviewed biologists and studied scientific genomic analysis, federal reports concerning super-spreading events, county
medical examiner's data from around the country, and state-level death and infection data.
Reporters used those sources to find and report the stories, many of them previously untold, of Americans in the path of
the virus.
What emerges is a portrait of misinformation and confusion leading to a devastating failure to unite against a common threat.
Piecemeal policies offered a dangerously hollow illusion of control and safety. Scientists, intermittently ignored and
villainized, were powerless. As citizens protested and rioted in response to racist police tactics, others detected a more
subtle form of prejudice in apathy toward a virus that disproportionately sickened Black and Brown Americans. Early
ignorance about the spread metastasized into partisan conspiracy-mongering and threats, leading to that most
American phenomenon: a health official with a bulletproof vest.
The novel coronavirus didn't start in the United States, but we have made it our own.
MLK Jr. Day: Zero official deaths
On Jan. 23, Dr. Benhur Lee stayed up late in his Manhattan apartment, working through the global ramifications of the
virus Americans had been told was not a threat to them.
""We have it totally under control,"" Trump had said the day before when asked about the single known case in the United
States. ""It's one person, coming in from China.""
But none of the early epidemiological research Lee was picking up from China, where the virus had killed thousands and
brought life to a standstill, suggested that assessment was correct.
Lee runs a research lab at Mount Sinai's medical school in New York City. He made a name for himself as an HIV
researcher in the early 2000s before moving on to tracking emerging viruses, becoming an expert on viruses such as
nipah, the bat-borne sickness featured in the film ""Contagion.""
Lee was one of thousands of scientists throughout the world who had since December been piecing together small
studies from doctors in other countries to understand the features of the virus that had emerged in Wuhan, with their
clues as to how it could be stopped.
In early January, scientists from China and Australia released an initial genome sequence of the virus. It closely
resembled SARS, the virus that much of the world barely dodged two decades earlier. And on this Thursday night, Lee
couldn't sleep because scientists had just released new findings estimating the human-to-human spread of the novel
coronavirus.
It was as infectious as Ebola, slightly less infectious than the 1918 Spanish flu, and much less infectious than HIV and
malaria. Lee tried to put the data in context by tweet. Over next few months, his Twitter account – @VirusWhisperer –
would gain tens of thousands of followers.
Lee knew that the United States had previously benefited from a mix of luck and coordination between U.S. agencies
and their international counterparts in stemming SARS and Ebola. That history was cold comfort to Lee, who knew that
the factors making a virus dangerous were difficult to predict.
The scientific community was not yet in agreement that the virus was capable of asymptomatic spread. Because carriers
often don't know they have it and in turn don't isolate, asymptomatic spread is a boon for a virus's rate of infection.
Lee didn't need a double-blind study to determine what was happening. The way the virus had blitzed across China was
evidence enough.
""There was obviously asymptomatic transmission going on,"" Lee said.
Over the next few weeks, Lee would witness a study in contrasts in how seriously major nations were taking the novel
coronavirus. On Jan. 25, he left for a microbiology conference in Sydney, stopping on the way in his home country of
Singapore. It was the beginning of the Year of the Rat, and Lee was celebrating the holiday with a visit to his parents.
He landed just as news broke that Singapore had its first confirmed case, in a traveler from Wuhan. Officials with latex
gloves and temperature guns checked for fever as he disembarked and boarded, and travelers from the Chinese
province that includes Wuhan were barred from entering the country.
By the time Lee returned to the United States on Feb. 3, there were confirmed cases on both coasts and in the
Midwest, and officials were announcing new ones every couple of days.
As he disembarked in Newark, New Jersey, Lee readied for the temperature check, the symptom screening, even the
racial profiling of an Asian traveler.
Instead, he checked in at a digital kiosk just as he always did. There was no temperature check. The border official
welcomed him into the country with no screening questions.
As he rolled his luggage out of the airport, Lee thought, That's not good.
***
For Dr. Jeff Smith, the top administrative official of Santa Clara County in California's Bay Area, it was a forgettable
topic of conversation, just one spouse griping about work to another.
In December 2019, Smith – who in addition to being county executive is also a medical doctor and a lawyer – was
chatting with his wife, a primary care doctor befuddled recently by an influx of patients seeking treatment for flu-like
symptoms, including coughing, achiness and fever. But when she tested for influenza, it came back negative.
Smith had no reason to think much of it.
""It was just a matter of, 'Well, gee, there's people that are sick, and it's a variant of the flu that doesn't show up on
the flu test,'"" the county executive later said.
By mid-January, the novel coronavirus was still just a slightly ominous curiosity to most Americans.
The first U.S. news reports about the virus, published earlier that month, were full of unanswered questions and
mistaken reports from China, including the initial belief that the virus could not be passed between humans.
Life proceeded as normal. San Francisco's international airport was one of two in the United States that had direct
flights to and from Wuhan. But members of the San Francisco Airport Commission, which oversees its operations,
showed no concern throughout January that it was an open portal for travelers from the viral epicenter.
A review of the commission's meetings that month showed that its members never discussed the novel coronavirus.
The government body was instead immersed in its own drama: A restaurateur had been charged with attempting to
give one of the commission members a $5,000 bribe to open a rotisserie chicken joint in the airport.
In the meantime, during the month of January, more than 2,400 passengers flew direct from Wuhan to San Francisco
on China Southern Airlines Flight CZ659, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data on the VariFlight app.
When a member of the airport commission finally did address the virus in early February, it was to urge travelers not
to change their plans for Chinese New Year, a holiday during which people often traveled abroad to visit their families.
""I think it's important for us to continue these celebrations knowing that professionals and government are really
taking the right precautions,"" commissioner Malcolm Yeung said at the time.
The dynamics make the Bay Area a good case study for how the virus was allowed in unchecked.
On Jan. 19, tens of thousands of fans packed Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara for a major sports event: The NFL's
conference championship game between the hometown San Francisco 49ers and the Green Bay Packers. The winner
would go to the Super Bowl.
At the time, most Americans knew relatively little about the novel coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention hadn't announced any cases in the United States.
Fans flew in from all over the country to attend the game. Masks and social distancing were not yet part of everyday
life.
Besides the few hours spent in the open-air stadium, fans stayed at hotels, ate at restaurants and shopped at
stores in the surrounding Santa Clara County, population 1.8 million.
It's impossible to draw a straight line from an event like this to a coronavirus outbreak without contact tracing, a
non-factor at the time. But around the area, there were deaths unattributed to COVID-19 that seem suspicious in
hindsight. Like a senior living home resident — stricken with symptoms including a persistent fever — whose
family was stunned by her sudden decline.
Or the previously healthy 57-year-old woman who collapsed in her kitchen.
County health officials assured residents they had no reason to worry about COVID-19, even as coroners listed
causes of deaths as ""pending,"" sometimes for months.
On the same day as the championship game, a 98-year-old woman named Marjorie Waggoner lay in a hospice bed
at a senior living center 14 miles away in San Jose, with a cold towel folded over her forehead as a measure
against the fever that had plagued her for more than a week.When her daughter Darryl Ospring took a photo of her that day, Waggoner was unconscious, scrawny and hollow-
eyed. It was a dramatic change from how she looked less than two months earlier, in a photo Ospring took aroundChristmas.
Waggoner, who her kids said always seemed decades younger than she was, wore carefully coiffed short curly hair,
a cheesy holiday sweater, a necklace made of bells, and a big, childlike grin. She suffered from Alzheimer's and
had been in hospice for a year following a series of falls, but she was faring so well that administrators were
considering returning her to normal care.
But on Jan. 8, Waggoner was tired and had no appetite. Within a few days, she had developed a cough, and then a
fever, and her condition rapidly spiraled from there. She died on Jan. 22.
Ospring was surprised by the cause listed on the death certificate – ""complications from neurodegenerative
disease"" – given that her mother's nurse had told her before she died that her chief ailment was her persistent
fever.
Waggoner was not autopsied, and Ospring honored her request to be cremated, even if it ruined her chance at
ever getting clear answers.
""I was trying to understand what happened to my mother in this small window of time,"" she said. ""It was as if the
Angel of Death just came in and ushered her out.""
Unbeknownst to Ospring, she was not alone among residents of her county in being blindsided by the sudden
demise of a loved one without a clear medical explanation.
On Feb. 6, a healthy 57-year-old named Patricia Cabello Dowd collapsed dead in her kitchen, the victim of what
was initially declared a ruptured heart.
Twelve days later, 69-year-old Filipino immigrant Arturo Difuntorum Rivera was found partially decomposed in the
home where he lived alone. For months, the medical examiner listed his cause of death as ""pending.""
Their lives had no obvious overlap, and they occupied different social strata. Dowd was a manager at a
semiconductor company that required regular international travel, though she hadn't been overseas recently.
Rivera was a security guard, who in recent employment at a hotel earned $14 an hour.
Neither was administered a blood test for COVID-19, and officially, there was no chance their deaths were related
to the virus. That's because Santa Clara County's top health officials were unequivocal at the time in declaring that
the virus was not spreading there.
At a public meeting Feb. 19, the county's public health chief, Sara Cody, said there was no reason for residents to
wear masks, cancel gatherings or seek testing for the virus if they were showing symptoms.
Cody said the county had only two confirmed cases, and both were travelers from Wuhan who had been ordered
to isolate.
""If somebody's not had travel to mainland China, we don't consider them a risk for COVID-19 and don't test,""
said Cody, who projected a message reading:
. On the day of Dowd's death, there was a single novel coronavirus test administered in all of Santa Clara
County, according to county data. On the date of Rivera's death, there were two tests. The county didn't top
1,000 tests a day until late April.
It wasn't until April 22 that the veil was partially lifted on what had been missed months earlier. Chief health
officer Cody held a press conference announcing that posthumous tests had revealed that three deaths months
earlier – those of Dowd, Rivera and a 70-year-old Filipino man named Rolando Olaguer – were actually due to
COVID-19.
Cody called them ""iceberg tips"" of an unseen outbreak. Dowd became the earliest confirmed casualty of the
virus in the United States, pre-dating a Seattle-area death on Feb. 28.
For county executive Smith, the revelation of early COVID-19 deaths made for a painful confirmation that his
county's policies had allowed residents to unknowingly infect and kill each other. He said his greatest regret was
trusting the CDC's guidance that there was no need for testing unless a person had symptoms and recent travel
to Wuhan. Similar frustrations were expressed by health officials around the U.S. who felt the CDC, previously
considered the world's premier health agency, had failed the country due to egregious missteps and
misinformation.
""I firmly believe that if the federal government had dealt with this appropriately, that many, many hundreds of
thousands of Americans would not have died,"" Smith said.
He's thought back to those conversations with his wife in December, during which she told him about patients
who had flu-like symptoms but tested negative for the flu. (Smith's wife, who works for a private corporation,
declined to be interviewed, citing medical privacy concerns.)
He now suspects that those patients had COVID-19, and that the virus has been circulating in his county since
December. It's a theory supported by academic research suggesting that the virus was in the U.S. then,
including a UCLA study that revealed a major spike in patients with coughs and acute respiratory failure in the
final month of 2019.
***
At the same time COVID-19 was spreading unseen through northern California, it was gaining a similar foothold
in other regions throughout the country.For Sevil Dungill in Chicago, his family's battle – and to an extent his city's – with the virus began with thin-
crust pizza and embraces of condolence from an old family friend.It was Feb. 28, the night before the celebration of Dungill's late sister, and the friend brought him a pie from
Home Run Inn.
They sat close together and, as they reached for slices of pizza, they lingered on everything but the novel
coronavirus. Following the deaths of Dungill's sister and mother, the friend seemed to understand he could use a
few-hour respite from talk of sickness.
Dungill's friend wasn't married and had no children. Instead he filled his life with extended families: his own,
and those of which he was an honorary member. Every Thanksgiving he stopped by to visit the Dungills, and he
called Sevil's elderly parents on their birthdays every year.
Dungill's friend had recently had a little scare with the virus. He had briefly lost his senses of taste and smell.
The friend, who USA TODAY is not naming because he declined to be interviewed, had been golfing in Arizona, where there were a handful of confirmed cases.
He knew the loss of those senses was a symptom. But his doctor prescribed him a steroid and assured him it
was just his asthma acting up.
By the time Dungill's friend hugged him goodbye, saying he'd see him at his sister's celebration the next day,
whatever bug that seemed to have been bothering him was gone except for a mild case of the sniffles.
***
Less than two weeks later, at around 7 a.m. on March 11, Dungill sat in the emergency room waiting area of
the Advocate Christ Medical Center.
Six others were also there seeking medical attention.
Dungill's illness had started about a week after his sister's celebration. He had been at his office when, while
reaching for a sweater, he realized he was freezing, while his eyes and forehead were burning.""Hey, if a miracle happens, I'll be at work tomorrow,"" Dungill announced to his boss after toggling on his out-
of-office email message. ""Otherwise, I'm out sick.""He made it back to his office after a couple of days off, but his fever persisted. His co-workers commented on
how terrible he looked.
When it hurt to breathe, Dungill relented and had his wife drop him off at the emergency room.
The admitting medical personnel appeared unconcerned that his symptoms were related to the novel
coronavirus. Though they gave Dungill a mask, none of the nurses or doctors wore any personal protective
equipment themselves.
They told Dungill they couldn't check for novel coronavirus. At the time, the CDC was only advising tests in
cases that fit narrow parameters, such as if the person had traveled to mainland China.
However, because the doctors were concerned about blood clotting, they had Dungill undergo a CT scan.
The doctor who brought the results to Dungill's hospital bed donned a jarring get-up, now including a face
mask and goggles.
The doctor explained that medical officials in China had reported that X-rayed images of the lungs of those
infected with the novel coronavirus often displayed damage that looked like a starry night or a cobweb.
Dungill's scans showed the same patterns.
Dungill blurted out a number: 845. It was the room in the same hospital where his dad was also laid up.
Cookie Dungill was dealing with his own persistent symptoms that doctors struggled to decipher. He had
initially shown up to the hospital due to constipation causing stomach-clenching discomfort, but he had been
sent home, diagnosed with a bad case of gas.
After the pain got even worse, he called an ambulance to take him back to the hospital. Even though one of
the symptoms of COVID-19 was abdominal pain, the hospital had apparently ruled it out without a test. They
had him share a room with a fellow patient.
Sevil said he urged his doctor to run the same CT scans on his father, and they came back with the similar
telltale pattern. It kicked off chaos in Advocate Christ.
Nurses and doctors who had treated both Dungill men without protection were sent home. According to a
later medical report, Cookie's ""12 attending nurses were also tested and were positive for COVID-19 and
quarantined.""
A spokesperson for Advocate Christ said they couldn't comment directly on this case, but that their staff
""consistently followed CDC guidance, which evolved as public health experts learned more about the virus
and its transmission,"" and that they required masks within the hospital starting March 31.
The doctors ultimately kept Cookie hospitalized but sent Sevil to the waiting area so his wife could pick him
up and take him home.
It was 11:44 p.m., about 17 hours after Sevil had first arrived at the hospital. The room was now crowded
with patients with symptoms just like his: red eyes and dry coughs and painful-sounding wheezes.
Everybody had been given masks.
Sevil again took a tally. He stopped counting at 80.

The scientist Benhur Lee spent the first few months of 2020 trying to get people to fathom the severity of
the virus already coursing through the country.
In mid-February, Lee bought Lysol spray, disinfecting wipes, and – even though the CDC was discouraging
them – medical face masks.
Lee found it reprehensible that the agency was advising Americans against wearing masks and claiming
that they were ineffective when scientists had long considered them a weapon against infection. So Lee
carried with him a bag of masks and handed them out to strangers on the streets and subways of New
York City.
He persuaded the doormen of his building to erect a plexiglass barrier between their desks and the lobby.
He tried to convince colleagues – who were all scientists – that they were underestimating the virus. He
joined a few dozen scientists who wrote a letter to New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio urging him to close
schools.
Lee's public health tweets got him branded as an alarmist. His inbox filled with threats or anti-Asian slurs,
spurring Lee to take a hiatus from Twitter.
And then, in the second week of March – the same week that the World Health Organization declared the
virus to be a pandemic – reality seemed to finally, if only partially, set in for the United States.
In a span of two days, the National Basketball Association suspended its season. Tom Hanks announced
that he had COVID-19. And Trump declared a national emergency while banning many Europeans from
entering the United States, adding to a partial ban on some foreign nationals who had visited China.
Lee's employer, Mount Sinai, closed all biology labs, except for those doing research related to COVID-19.
Lee pivoted to making an ingredient to test people's blood for the virus.
The emergency declaration was, in the estimation of international scientists, long overdue, coming six
weeks after the WHO had already declared the virus to be a global public health emergency.
Americans around the country would soon enter lockdowns. It was a fearful and painful moment, but also
one where the damage from previous inaction was not yet set, said Ranney, the doctor and professor. She
said that the federal government could have attempted to catch up on infrastructures for testing, contact
tracing, and distributing PPE.
""But we didn't,"" she said.
Easter: 27,342 deaths
On March 17, two men hustled into a nearly-empty rest stop in Maryland. Four hours into their 1,200-mile
drive from New York to Florida, they realized they weren't going to make it on sandwiches and PowerBars alone, and stopped to fortify with Wendy's cheeseburgers.
One of the men was middle-aged and svelte. The other was more than two decades older, hobbled but
still sprightly, with an oxygen tank piped to his nose and slung over his shoulder like a school bag. They
wore face masks weeks before the CDC recommended them, and latex gloves.
As they exited the rest stop for the highway, Tom Kirdahy, then 56, and Terrence McNally, 81, felt safer
with each mile they put between themselves and New York. It was as if they could feel the virus
receding behind them.
They were near the front of a great informal migration southward from the New York City area.
While other countries instituted national lockdown orders to freeze citizens and the virus in place, the
United States had only localized, and relatively lax, versions of such edicts. Americans responded by
moving more than ever.
McNally fled New York with husband Kirdahy because he had only three-quarters of a lung left and was
terrified the virus would make quick work of him.
The couple's history together had another pandemic as a backdrop. In 1995, Kirdahy, an attorney
representing those infected with HIV and AIDS, was transfixed in a Broadway theater as he watched a
gay male character kiss a purple scar on the chest of another.
In Kirdahy's view, society had decided that eradicating the AIDS epidemic was not a priority because
those it was killing, mostly gay men, were considered no great loss.
He had held the hands of many gay men as they died without the presence of family members who
were afraid of infection or disdainful of their sexuality.
So attending ""Love! Valour! Compassion!"" written by McNally, whom Kirdahy then only knew as a famed
playwright, was ""like being in church,"" he said.
It was the story of eight gay men on vacation together, including one, played by Nathan Lane, who
kissed the AIDS lesion of another. Kirdahy and his companions at the theater, all of whom worked on the
AIDS front lines or were infected with the virus, wept and hugged each other.
Kirdahy, a lifelong theater buff, met McNally six years later after inviting him to join a panel of famed
gay playwrights he organized in the Hamptons, New York. They bonded over a shared familiarity with
AIDS. Two of McNally's previous partners had died of the virus, and the playwright had seen firsthand
the isolation suffered by its victims in their last moments.
They married in 2003, with Kirdahy warning that he wasn't going to shelve his ambition and become
""Mrs. McNally."" He ultimately left his law practice to become one of the most prolific theater producers
on Broadway and London's West End, racking up armfuls of theater awards to rival those of his
husband.
But a diagnosis only months after they had started dating injected their relationship with a perpetually
fleeting quality. McNally's former three-pack-a-day smoking habit had stricken him with lung cancer.
Surgery left him with a quarter of his right lung and only half of his left. For decades he was in and out
of the hospital, including with potentially life-ending bouts of pneumonia.
McNally made light of it. When he and Kirdahy bought a vacation apartment in Sarasota, Florida, in
2017, McNally predicted he would die there. ""I know how this story ends,"" he joked.
And in June 2019, when he was awarded a Tony for lifetime achievement, he accepted it with his oxygen
tank attached and told the crowd: ""Not a moment too soon.""
During the first weeks of March, when it became clear that New York City was usurping the Seattle area as a national epicenter of coronavirus, they made hasty plans to drive to the apartment in Florida
until its spread blew over.
At a roadside motel room in North Carolina, they napalmed every surface with Clorox and Lysol. In
Georgia the next day, lunch was sandwiches handed off between latex-covered fingers at a Starbucks
drive-through.
By dusk on the 18th, they were on their balcony rocking chairs in Sarasota, watching the sky turn a
bruised pink over the Gulf of Mexico. McNally's health had worsened, as he had grown weaker and
short of breath. But he preferred sipping seltzer with his husband than more time in a hospital.
On the evening of March 20, McNally said, for the first time in their relationship: ""I want to talk about
dying.""
What followed was a long conversation, ranging from nuts-and-bolts estate planning to spiritual
matters.
""We talked about family and friends and art and nature and gratitude,"" Kirdahy said. ""A lot about
gratitude.""
At 9:21 the next morning, Kirdahy called 911 to report that his husband was coughing up blood.
***
Five days before Kirdahy's 911 call, Cookie Dungill called Sevil from his Chicago hospital room with a
sudden concern.
Cookie couldn't remember if he had paid his bills that month. He asked his son to head over to his
house and make sure he was up to date on his gas and lights.
Sevil had for the last week been suffering an odyssey of severe symptoms from his own bout of
COVID-19. He isolated on the first floor of his home, wearing a mask and leaving the second floor to
his teenage son and wife, who brought him trays of food and stayed six feet away.
He had pneumonia, diarrhea and such severe night sweats that he had to get up in the middle of the
night to change his soaked shirt.
But because he didn't want his dad to worry about his own poor health, he agreed to check on his
bills. He dragged himself out to his car, made it to his father's house and slumped in front of the
computer with Cookie on the phone.
It took them 21/2 hours to puzzle through usernames and passwords to ascertain that Cookie had in
fact paid his bills before he was hospitalized. They wheezed with laughter at their own ineptitude.
""Dad, don't worry,"" Sevil said. ""We're going to make it.""
Cookie called again a few days later, but this time his son couldn't pick up. He was on the other line
with an official from the CDC, who was pumping him with detailed questions about his movements
and interactions in the previous two weeks.
The official wanted to know everything about the pizza dinner Sevil shared with his friend. He wanted
to know who was in what rooms of the church the next day, who shook hands and hugged, and who
ate from the buffet.
The health agency was following a cluster of Chicago cases that hinged on a single event: Angeli's
Joyous Celebration. The CDC was in the midst of declaring it one of the country's earliest and most
severe coronavirus spreading events, likely infecting at least 16 people.
And at its center was a single individual, Sevil's friend, whom the CDC believed had brought the virus from Arizona. The friend had gone to a birthday party a few days after the funeral and apparently
spread the virus to family members, according to the CDC. The virus then spread further when
those family members went to sermon at a packed church, complete with a collection plate as a
possible vector.
Even without the call from the health official, Sevil's vicinity to the epicenter of the spread of the
virus in Chicago was already clear to him.
On March 16, his friend's sister died. A warm, boisterous woman known for singing in church, she
was the first official novel coronavirus death in Illinois. His friend lost another sister to the virus
less than two weeks later.
When Sevil got off the phone with the contact tracer, he went to call Cookie back at the hospital.
But his father was by then unconscious, having been put on a ventilator.
Sevil later learned from his sister Gina the words that were among his last.
Cookie had called her to say the hospital staff was urging him to go on the ventilator not because
he needed it yet, but because he was experiencing labored breathing and the staff didn't want to
have run out of them when he did need one.
It was a reasoning common earlier in the pandemic that medical experts now regret, following
studies showing that ventilators were overused and might have contributed to a higher death rate.
Gina encouraged him to follow the doctors' recommendations, optimistic that it would help him
recover. Though he agreed, she later said she could hear the fear in his voice.
""I don't want to die,"" he told her.
***
USA TODAY shared with Ranney, the emergency physician and Brown University professor, the
stories of both the Dungills in Chicago and the ailing playwright McNally's sojourn to Florida.
Ranney said that the thread that ran through both of their cases was that they had been failed by
the government. A dearth of testing, medical equipment, and sound scientific guidance had
abandoned them, like thousands of other Americans, to fumble alone through infection with a
deadly virus.
Even if the government had handled the pandemic well, Ranney said, the virus still would have
ripped a deadly course through the country.
""But it would've provided guidance to people like that man on what to do,"" she said, referring to
McNally. ""It would have allowed him to get a test. And it would have kept people from having that
abject fear that led them to flee, and to bring the virus with them.""
After his husband, Kirdahy, called 911 to report that he was coughing up blood, McNally was taken
to a Sarasota hospital. He was isolated and, within a couple of days, put on a ventilator. After a
COVID-19 test came back positive and his oxygen levels dipped dangerously, Kirdahy made the
decision to take him off of the ventilator.
Kirdahy's promise to his husband that he'd be holding his hand while he died weighed heavily on
him. He asked the doctors whether he could enter his hospital room, and they allowed him.
""I'm one of the lucky ones,"" Kirdahy said of being able to say goodbye. He would later test positive
for virus antibodies, suggesting he was an asymptomatic carrier.
Independence Day: 130,127 deaths
There was a window of opportunity in early spring — before Americans were dug intractably into
separate trenches, before wearing a face mask had somehow become a defining political issue,
and militia members were caught allegedly plotting to kidnap the Michigan governor over
lockdown orders — when the country could have unified in order to beat back the virus.
""People were willing to listen to public health officials, and they were willing to take
precautions,"" Ranney said. ""We squandered that.""
Part of the problem was the contradictory messages coming from government officials. The CDC
recommended masks in early spring after months of advising against them, and elected leaders
clashed over state and local rules — like whether to close Georgia's beaches — in the absence of
a clear national edict.
Such at-odds approaches made it feel like safety measures were the whims of public officials,
often determined by their political alignment.
The deepening political entrenchment was led by the president. Trump mocked face coverings
even after his government recommended them. He publicly undermined Dr. Anthony Fauci, the
government's top infectious disease expert. He called COVID-19 the ""China virus"" in spite of
increased attacks against Asian Americans. And he made an axiom of declaring that the cure —
lockdowns recommended by top members of his own national health team — was worse than
the virus itself.
The division thrust into the spotlight government doctors, the kind of career public servants
whose names the average constituent might never otherwise learn.
Scott Harris, Alabama's state health officer, said he decided to go into public health after two
decades in his private practice in Decatur observing how illnesses hit his Black patients harder.
""If public health exists for one reason it's to promote health equity,"" said Harris, a soft-spoken
physician.
Harris encountered the politicization immediately after his state had its first official case, on
March 13. Alabamians in his inbox challenged his counting of ""presumed"" cases, which follow a
positive test, versus cases that the CDC reviewed and confirmed.
Later that month, Harris's staff debated how to classify one of the state's first deaths involving a
positive test for COVID-19. The decedent was a young person who had a stroke while infected
with the virus. In a deeply-red state under a Republican governor, Kay Ivey, Harris said his staff
ultimately reported it as ""death by stroke, in a person who also had Covid.""
""And then, within a couple months, it became clear that's one way people with COVID die,""
Harris later said.
""At that time there was all this pressure — well still is, this pressure,"" Harris said. ""These
pressures to minimize what's actually going on, and people were hyper-alert to try to make sure
we counted our cases correctly.""
The hostility continued after the governor issued a stay-at-home order on April 3, in response to
a crisis of overwhelmed hospital beds, infected health-care workers and a rising death count in
nursing homes.
Emailers lectured him on states' rights and personal liberty, and sent Benjamin Franklin's
Revolutionary War cartoon reading, ""Join, or Die."" Even when email called him a dictator, Harris
looked to see if they contained legitimate questions, and forwarded those messages to his staff
so the experts could educate them.
Others explicitly threatened him. ""I'm going to show up at your house, and you better watch out because I know where you live,"" one person wrote.
The state gave Harris an around-the-clock security detail and a ballistic vest. They told him to
fling it on and lock his door if he heard a loud noise.
Harris's experiences were not unique: State health officers around the country experienced
similar treatment, with hundreds facing threats or resigning.
***
Ivey's change in policy made Alabama one of the first states to lift restrictions following
encouragement from Trump, who by mid-April had called for states to reopen their
economies.
After the Alabama governor gave up the lectern to Harris, he struck a markedly different
tone. His mask down around his chin, Harris spoke soberly about data emerging in Alabama,
as it was throughout the country, that showed that the virus disproportionately impacted
Black and Hispanic Americans. Black Alabamians represented a quarter of the state but half of
its COVID-19 deaths to that point.
The decision to reopen most of Alabama may have been welcome to many residents,
including business owners. To Linda Gilchrist, a nurse who works at a Montgomery senior
home, it was devastating. After finishing a shift — followed by a lengthy clothes-washing and
showering routine so as to not infect her family — she caught Ivey's press conference on
television.
Dozens of Gilchrist's patients had died from the virus, and she had stood in a meeting that
day where stakeholders discussed getting more patients into the rehab unit. In Montgomery,
coronavirus cases had been steadily rising. Ivey's policy change certainly wasn't based on the
state having flattened the curve.
""Oh my God,"" Gilchrist thought to herself. ""Why are we doing this?""
William Boyd, a lifelong resident of deeply segregated, majority-Black Montgomery, thought
he had an explanation. Boyd had lost six relatives or close friends to the virus, including his
brother. He saw the growing apathy toward the virus in Alabama as a result of policy-makers
learning that Black people were most vulnerable. The CDC had just come out with that
information on April 8.
The hospital where Boyd's brother died had a policy allowing loved ones access if they were
near death, and he described sharing a waiting area with those who were about to say
goodbye to a patient. ""It was an ugly sight, and I saw all Black people,"" Boyd said.
Boyd addressed the Montgomery City Council in June when they considered a mask mandate.
""The question on the table is whether Black lives matter,"" he said. The mandate failed after
the eight-member council voted mostly along racial lines, Black members for the mandate
and white members against it.
The next month, the Montgomery council members reversed themselves and passed the
mandate. Ivey also revisited the statewide mask issue during another press conference,
roughly six weeks after the one where she'd cracked the joke about her hairdresser. Harris
was back at her side.
Cases in Alabama had more than doubled in the month before the announcement, to more
than 60,000, adding more than 1,100 cases per day on average.
***
The unique rub of the novel coronavirus is that attempts to defeat it tend to open up
another front of misery. Extended lockdowns deliver their own world of grief, as the
millions of newly unemployed Americans can attest. The tug-of-war between industry and
public health has often resulted in public policy that keeps the economy afloat at the
expense of the health, and often lives, of those with the least agency.
Nowhere has that been more clear than in the federal government's handling of the
meatpacking crisis.
In mid-April, Minnesota hog farmer Greg Boerboom heard from a representative of
Smithfield Foods that the meat conglomerate had to delay its weekly purchase of several
semi loads of his animals due to illness at the company's Sioux Falls plant.
But Boerboom wasn't worried the disruption would extend any longer than a few days. The
meat industry had eradicated uncertainty a long time ago. Boerboom contracts with the
few multinational corporations that control the meat processing industry. It's a departure
from the system he learned as a young man on his father's farm, where they'd haul 30
hogs at a time behind their '59 Chevrolet three hours away to the stockyards in St. Paul to
search for buyers.
Critics deride the ruthless efficiency of the business but Boerboom, 59, sees progress. ""We
can glamorize the good old days,"" he said, ""but the fact of the matter is they weren't that
glamorous.""
But the drawbacks of the modern meatpacking model began to show when a
representative for Tyson Foods also called Boerboom to say COVID-19 cases were forcing
the temporary closure of the company's plant in Waterloo, Iowa.
The two plants represented roughly 60% of Boerboom's business. And as a month came
and went, and the plants remained closed, his stock of roughly 100,000 overgrown hogs
crowded against each other in his barns. Boerboom had to consider ways to quickly reduce
his inventory, including whether to execute a large number of them with a handgun.
His colleagues were doing it, those who weren't pumping carbon monoxide into their barns
to kill thousands of their hogs. All across the country, hog farmers faced the same grim
scenario.
***
The virus had forced farmer Greg Boerboom to revert to his dad's old way of doing
business, selling a few hogs here or there and stocking the butcher shops on nearby Main
Streets. But Boerboom isn't the nostalgic type. When the Smithfield and Tyson buyers
returned in late May, he rejoiced and credited Trump's executive order.
The order was a boon for those major corporations, which as it turns out were never at risk
for a severe meat shortage. In fact, a significant portion of the hogs Boerboom sold to
Smithfield and Tyson likely ended up not in American kitchens, but in Chinese ones.
Market data showed that during the period when meatpacking executives were warning
that the food supply chain was breaking, they were exporting millions of tons of meat
overseas – even more than in previous years.
The federal government had prioritized the production of meat over the safety of low-paid,
mostly-immigrant workers. In the months following Trump's executive order, plant
operators claimed to have implemented safety guards such as plexiglass barriers and
mandatory masks. But there was little federal oversight monitoring those measures.
COVID-19 cases in the plants skyrocketed, and often so did the case counts of their
surrounding communities.
As of September, there would be more than 200 deaths among meatpacking workers
who had contracted the virus.
Boerboom thinks the media has mostly ignored the real story, which is post-traumatic
stress and depression he predicts will linger with hog farmers. ""The big story is going to
be the financial and emotional drain to the farming community in small-town America,""
he said.
But he says Trump deserves gratitude for returning the business to the status quo even
in the midst of a pandemic. ""I think that's what saved our industry,"" Boerboom said. ""If
he had not done that, we would be out of business today.""
Thanksgiving: 263,456 deaths
In early April, Gina Jere drove to a cremation center where a man in full protective gear
dropped into her trunk a triple-bagged Hefty containing Cookie Dungill's watch, glasses,
cell phone and a container of his ashes.
When her brother Sevil Dungill learned that their father had died, he was still in the
throes of his own severe sickness, isolated on the first floor of his house.
He kept six feet away as he told his teenage son about Cookie's passing.
""We're not going to grieve right now,"" said Dungill, who was terrified of infecting his wife
and son. ""Because grieving makes you weak.""
Dungill finally left his home after nearly two months of sickness in isolation. He emerged
to a changed world full of face masks and strange new rituals at the supermarket.
Protests and riots then followed and brought shattered storefronts to his Chicago
neighborhood.
Like other families that have lost loved ones this year, it's hard to predict when, if ever,
the Dungills will be able to properly grieve. There was no funeral or memorial for Cookie
Dungill and, considering the results of the family's last gathering to mark a death, there
probably never will be.
For Sevil Dungill, the lack of closure concerning his father's death has also consumed his
perspective on the other family members he lost in 2020. Like Darryl Ospring's fixation
on her mother's January death in the Bay Area, Dungill suspects that COVID-19 was
responsible for the deaths of his sister in January and his mother in February.
Before his family's saga with the illness, he accepted without doubt that their deaths
were a result of cancer.
But he has since thought back on their sudden declines. His sister Angeli was put under
a hospital ventilator before dying, according to her death certificate, of acute respiratory
distress syndrome, pneumonia and metastatic lung cancer. His mother's official cause of
death was aspiration pneumonia and congestive heart failure.
The lung-related conditions are hallmarks of COVID-19 deaths. But Dungill will never
know for sure, since both women were cremated and not autopsied.

"Racism targets Asian food, business in US during pandemic",None,Others,2020-12-21,"Some initial evidence suggested the virus began in bats, which infected another animal that may have spread it
to people at one of Wuhan, China’s “wet markets.” Such markets sell fresh meat, fish and vegetables, and some
also sell live animals, such as chickens, that are butchered on site to ensure freshness for consumers, The
Associated Press reported.
The information quickly got distorted in the US, spurring racist memes on social media that portrayed Chinese
people as bat eaters responsible for spreading the virus, and reviving century-old tropes about Asian food being
dirty. Fueling the fire, President Donald Trump repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as “the China virus.”
“That old-school rhetoric that we eat bats, dogs and rats — that racism is still alive and well,"" said Clarence
Kwan, creator of the anti-racist cooking zine “Chinese Protest Recipes.” The speed with which such false
stereotypes resurfaced during the pandemic is ""a reflection of how little progress we’ve made,” Kwan said.
In the Wuhan market where the virus is believed to possibly have originated, vendors also advertised wildlife for
sale. Of the 33 samples from the market that tested positive for the coronavirus, officials say 31 were from the
area where wildlife booths were concentrated. But wildlife and other “exotic” animals are not part of the modern
mainstream Asian diet, either in Asian countries or in the US
All of the misinformation has had serious consequences.
Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition of Asian-American advocacy groups, issued a report in August stating that it had
received more than 2,500 reports of hate and discrimination across the country since the group was founded in
March, around the time the outbreak began to seriously worsen in the US The group said it received data from
47 states, with 46% of the incidents taking place in California, followed by 14 percent in New York.
In addition, Asian-American small businesses have been among the hardest hit by the economic downturn
during the pandemic. While there was a 22 percent decline in all small business-owner activity nationwide from
February to April, Asian-American business-owner activity dropped by 26 percent, according to a study by the
National Bureau of Economic Research.
Many businesses that survived have been subject to stigmatization, Kwan said. “Restaurants have been
vandalized. As if the pandemic wasn’t hard enough, there’s this added threat to Asian businesses of this
lingering hate.”
Conversations about the stigmatization of Asian food reached a crescendo this month when Philli Armitage-
Mattin, a contestant on “MasterChef: The Professionals,” used the phrase “Dirty Food Refined” and the hashtag
#prettydirtyfood in her Instagram bio, which described her as an Asian food specialist.
“In a year where Chinese and East Asian communities have essentially been blamed for the pandemic and
chastised as ‘dirty,’ this type of narrative is completely unacceptable,” Kwan wrote on Instagram.
Armitage-Mattin's bio has since been changed and the London-based chef apologized on Instagram, while also
insisting that she had never meant to insult anyone.
“The way I mean food to be ‘dirty’ is indulgent street food; food that comforts you as in, ‘going out for a dirty
burger,’” she wrote.
But Kwan said especially in the current climate, such phrases can be dangerous.
“It was a very flippant, ignorant, tone-deaf way of talking about Asian food,” he said.
Racist rhetoric referring to Asian food as dirty or disease-laden dates back to the 1850s, said Ellen Wu, a history
professor at Indiana University. Wu said the false notion that Chinese people eat rat or dog meat is rooted in the
xenophobic fears of white workers who used Chinese immigrant workers as a scapegoat for their economic
woes.
“To white Americans, these new immigrants were different in a threatening way, and there is fear of the ‘other,’
of difference,” said Wu, who is Asian-American.
English professor Anita Mannur of Miami University said the current crisis reminds her of racist cartoons from
the late 1800s that advertised for rat poison by picturing a Chinese man about to eat one of the rodents.
Mannur, who is Indian-American, said other persistent false narratives such as that Chinese American
neighborhoods or Chinatowns are dens of vice send the message that Asian people are less civilized, and do
""very immediate damage.”
“People have had their houses graffitied with things like ‘Dog eaters live here,’"" she said. “People are beaten up
and spat on. People are told to go back to China.”
Benny Yun, owner of the Yang Chow restaurant in Los Angeles’ Chinatown district and two other locations in
Southern California, said even though his businesses have survived the pandemic, they get prank calls almost
daily asking if they have dog or cat on the menu or impersonating a thick Asian accent.
“The worst part is if they realize you speak perfect English, then they just give you a random order and we
prepare it and they don’t even come to pick it up. Waste of time and money,” Yun said.
For years, health inspectors have been accused of docking points from Chinese restaurants for employing
traditional cooking and presentation methods, such as hanging roast duck in the front window. The common
yet scientifically disproven claim that MSG causes illness made the Chinese food flavor enhancer highly
unpopular in the 1970s, forcing many Asian-American restaurants to eliminate it from their kitchens.
Kwan said it is important for Asian-Americans to protest the way they are being treated; to push back against
the latest onslaught of bias and racism by continuing to unabashedly celebrate their food and culture.
“We don’t have to change,"" he said. ""We can live, breathe and eat exactly the way we do without having to
adapt to white supremacy, to the white gaze, to whiteness. We can be proud of our culinary heritage.”

How can a President Biden 'change the narrative' for Asian-Americans?,None,Others,2020-12-15,"In theory, Valley Brook Tea is an unlikely place for a hate crime. The speciality tea store is located on a busy
commercial avenue in Washington's affluent Dupont Circle area, just steps away from some of the most popular
bars and cafes, high-end hotels and multimillion-dollar town houses in the nation's capital, a city which prides
itself on tolerance and diversity.
Yet, on a quiet morning last month, this was where a rising wave of xenophobia and anti-Asian sentiment came
for 29-year-old Yunhan Zhang, who opened his store in February.
The store's closed circuit television captured what happened: a man, wearing red pants and a black jacket,
enters the store yelling ""Covid-19!"" After being told to go away, the agitated assailant pulls out a can of pepper
spray, using it on Zhang as he continues to hurl insults - which explicitly contained the term ""Chinese"" - before
fleeing the scene.
For Zhang, an 11-year resident of the United States, the motive was clear. It marked the second time, he said,
that he had been targeted in an area otherwise known for its safety.
""This type of hate crime happened to us, again,"" he wrote on Twitter the day of the incident. ""It seems we're the
only business that keeps getting harassed and attacked in this neighbourhood.""
Zhang is not alone. Across the country, organisations that track discrimination, harassment and violence against Asian-Americans have noted a steady rise in incidents throughout the four years of the Trump administration.
Incidents were already on the rise as a result of US President Donald Trump's contentious relationship with
China and harsh immigration policies - but overt displays of discrimination spiked during the Covid-19pandemic. The Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Centre, a California-based group that monitors attacks on Asian-
Americans and Pacific Islanders, for example, reported more than 2,700 incidents between March and lateOctober alone - a figure the organisation believes is just the ""tip of the iceberg"".
To combat this wave of xenophobia and anti-Asian sentiment, policy experts and community activists believe
that Joe Biden's incoming administration can take a number of steps, starting with a rapid reversal of Trump's
immigration policies.
John Yang, the president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, a Washington-based civil
rights group, said that ending many of these policies would help ""change the narrative"" on Asian-Americans.
""Immediately, we'd expect the [incoming] president to take a number of measures by executive order, or
rescind executive orders that have hurt immigrants,"" he said. ""This has a direct impact on the population, but
also sends a message that immigrants are welcome in the United States.""
One step that Biden could take through executive order, Yang said, was dropping the ""public charge"" rule that
allowed immigration officials to deny ""green cards"" - permanent residency - to immigrants who might need
public assistance, like food stamps. Opponents of the measure, first announced in 2018, have termed it a
""wealth test"" for immigrants.
""For the last four years, the narrative has been that immigrants are not welcome here, and that communities of
colour are somehow a threat,"" Yang added. ""That has to change, and that can change through executive
orders.""
Other steps could include facilitating H1-B visas, which allow US employers to temporarily employ foreign
nationals in specialised occupations. In October, the Trump administration said it would impose salary
requirements - of US$150,000 to US$250,000 a year, depending on location and job title - on companies
employing these skilled overseas workers. At the time, the government said that the primary purpose of the
change was to ""reflect the actual wages earned by US workers similarly employed to foreign workers"".
Government statistics show that most of the almost 600,000 H1-B visa holders in the US are from China and
India. Earlier in the year, Trump signed an executive order suspending an array of worker visas - including H1-
Bs - before that decision was overturned by a federal judge. The announcement regarding the salary
requirements came the following week. Last week, a federal judge in California struck down the revised Trump
administration rules.
Doing away with H1-B visa restrictions ""would send a strong signal that immigrants are welcome and that
vilifying various groups isn't appropriate"", said Russell Jeung, the Stop AAPI Hate chair and an Asian American
Studies professor at San Francisco State University.
""We recommend reversing immigration bans and stopping the suspension of visas for Chinese researchers and
students, as well as rescinding the ban on racial sensitivity training"" at federal agencies, he added. ""In the first
100 days, a lot can be done to signal that we're ending racist policies.""
Many of these steps were outlined by the Biden campaign in an agenda for Asian-Americans and Pacific
Islanders released ahead of the November election. Biden vowed to provide a ""road map"" to citizenship for
undocumented immigrants, including 1.7 million from Asia. He also promised to support family-based
immigration and increase the number of visas offered for permanent, work-based immigration.
The Biden transition team did not respond to a request for comment on its plans for the Asian-American community.
Policy experts believe that a change in tone from the president and other administration officials on relations
with China would have an important impact on how Asian-Americans are perceived in the US.
Jeung said that Stop AAPI Hate believes a ""more sane, diplomatic foreign policy"" - rather than a ""heated cold
war"" - will help ease feelings of animosity towards Chinese and Asian-Americans in communities across the
country.
""We've seen how US-China relations have impacted domestic race relations,"" he said. ""You can be critical, but
... a critique of China's policies doesn't mean we should vilify Chinese people.""
This rhetoric, Jeung added, became more pronounced during the pandemic, which Trump repeatedly termed
the ""Chinese Virus"" and ""Kung Flu"". Hundreds of incidents of harassment have been recorded in which similar
terms were used.
""The tone in which Trump mocked Chinese people and joked about the pandemic really gave people license to
also attack the people, rather than criticise a government's policies,"" Jeung said. ""We're portrayed as
outsiders and we need to have a greater sense that everyone can belong to the United States. It has a
tangible impact.""
Many Chinese-American community organisers believe that having Asian-American figures in Biden's cabinet
or in other high-level administration positions would serve as an important symbol. ""It would be great to see
Chinese and Asian-American appointees,"" said Leanna Louie, a founder of the United Peace Collaborative, a
registered non-profit organisation in San Francisco that has patrolled the city's Chinatown during the
pandemic.
""If other Asians see that someone, like [businessman and former presidential candidate] Andrew Yang was in
the cabinet, they'd think to get involved and help the community,"" she added.
""People need to think of the community as a whole rather than just themselves.""
Trump does have one Asian-American in his cabinet: Taiwan-born Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, a
long-time Republican figure who previously served as Secretary of Labor in the Bush administration. Last
week, Trump also nominated Chao, the wife of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, to the board of
trustees of the John F. Kennedy Centre for the Performing Arts.
""Having an immigrant background doesn't mean you represent the interest of immigrants, or support those of
different class or racial backgrounds,"" Jeung said of Chao. ""She hasn't had much impact ... she either doesn't
have a voice on those issues in the administration or hasn't been a strong enough advocate.""Looking ahead to the Biden administration, Jeung said that he believes that the presence of vice-president-
elect Kamala Harris - whose mother was from India - will have a beneficial impact on Americans whosefamilies originated in other parts of Asia.
""She's the daughter of immigrants and talks about her mother. That makes a difference to the community.
It's not about having diversity for diversity's sake, it's about having a diverse cabinet that understands all the
different issues that we have to grapple with in the country,"" he said. ""Having a cabinet that reflects the
complexity of America will only make the government stronger.""
Last Thursday, the Biden transition team announced that Katherine Tai, now the chief trade lawyer for the
House Ways and Means Committee, would be nominated to the cabinet-level position of US trade
representative. If confirmed by the Senate, Tai, a Taiwanese-American, will be the first Asian-American to
hold the position. ""I cannot stress the importance of naming Katie Tai as US trade representative,"" Jeung said.
""US-China relations have deteriorated to China-bashing, and subsequently physical bashings of Chinese
and Asians in the US.
""Other Americans need to see an Asian-American public official representing the US, and building bridges,
not walls.""
Even if Biden were to immediately reverse Trump's immigration policies and soften his tone on China when
he takes office on January 20, experts warn that a higher level of anti-Chinese and anti-Asian sentiment is
likely to remain for years to come.
""Unfortunately, some of the damage has been done. Especially as we do not see a near-term resolution of
Covid-19, there will be people that continue to blame Asian-Americans for the pandemic,"" Jeung said.""Some of that hate isn't going to resolve itself immediately. That will cause tensions with respect to anti-
Asian racism in the community,"" he added. ""But better rhetoric from the top is going to help immensely.""Karlin Chan, a community activist and lifelong resident of New York's Chinatown who organises ""block
watch"" patrols to safeguard local residents, said that the anti-Asian sentiment of the Trump era is merely
another in a long series of difficult periods for the community in the United States.
""Once a monster rears its ugly head, it takes years to subside. It's like the ripples when you throw a big
stone into a calm lake,"" he said. ""It will be years before we overcome this xenophobia.""
As Joe Biden prepares to take the reins in Washington, the stakes have never been higher for the US
relationship with China and the rest of Asia. Bernd Debusmann Jnr, in the latest in a post-election series,
looks at the steps advocates for Asian-Americans say should be taken to reduce the hostility arising from
the policies that the Trump administration has encouraged

First Person: A life of being a perpetual foreigner,"Li, Veronica",Others,2021-04-25,"I was sitting on my mother's bed when she asked me what I was doing that weekend. I burst into tears. 
""I have no friends,"" I blurted. 
""Your family are your friends,"" Mom said. 
I sobbed louder. This wasn't what a seventeen-year-old wanted to hear. 
My family had immigrated to California three years earlier, one of the first from Hong Kong to take advantage of the 1965 Immigration Act. We were middle class, well educated, and fluent in English-my mom was an English teacher and my dad a businessman. 
I went on crying while my mother sat helplessly next to me. Words were useless because I couldn't explain myself. I'd done everything I could possibly think of to worm my way into my classmates' hearts. 
When they came to me with, ""Veronica, you're so smart, can you show me..."" I would let them copy my homework. I went to all the football games, cheering for the school team until my voice was hoarse. I joined extracurricular activities such as Treble Clef and caroled with my schoolmates at Christmas. But at the end of my senior year, when social aptitude was the only skill set left in the high school curriculum, I flunked miserably. 
Back in Hong Kong, my peers had liked me well enough to elect me class monitor. In America, nobody ever said an unkind word to me, and yet loneliness sat like an elephant on my chest. I was totally mystified, but that day at choir, one person blew the mystery wide open. Ken, the blind boy I spent time with during choir breaks, said to the tenor next to him: ""We're both outcasts. Why else would she hang out with me?"" 
It took me a few blinks to realize he was talking about me. His words struck like lightning, and for a few seconds the truth flickered before me, painful and liberating at the same time. 
Fast forward twenty years. I was a confident officer of the World Bank, traveling around the world to help poor countries develop. I bought a home in Vienna, VA, a prosperous suburb of the nation's capital. 
While walking in the neighborhood with my ten-year-old boy, several teenagers sang ""Ching chong chang"" as we passed. I told my son to ignore them. They're teenagers, I said, as though that explained everything. 
On Halloween, somebody threw a pumpkin at my door. When a guest of mine parked on the street, somebody keyed an ugly scratch on his car. The acts of vandalism dissipated over time. 
I thought it was because my neighbors had grown used to my overzealous German shepherd barking at every passerby. I thought that until a Black Zimbabwean coworker stayed with me for a couple of months while waiting for her new house to be completed. One morning, I went out and found the back window of my car shattered. Lightning flashed: my German shepherd wasn't and had never been the problem. I called the police to report a hate crime. 
Fast forward another thirty years. I was a gray-haired retiree when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Several days after President Trump coined the term ""China virus,"" I was stocking up on essentials at the pharmacy. There was only one worker in the store, an older woman with a hostile face that warned me to stay away. From a safe distance, I asked her when the next shipment of hand sanitizer was arriving. She couldn't or wouldn't say; it was hard to tell. 
I took the last few rolls of toilet paper to the self-checkout register. The machine kept dinging at me. When I asked for help, the woman told me to ignore it. Then I overheard her talking to another shopper, something about a stupid customer who couldn't figure out the checkout machine. I got into my car, and suddenly the sky cracked open. The stupid customer she was mocking was me! 
After fifty some years in America, this transplant has grown deep roots. Unfortunately, some of my countrymen still view me as an invasive foreign species. Hostility bubbles below the surface, and when politicians dial up the heat, the simmering erupts into full-throated hatred. 
At the start of the pandemic, Asian American organizations donated to hospitals large amounts of face masks and other PPE's as well as meals to frontline healthcare workers. But the assault on our communities didn't abate. 
Verbal abuse such as ""Go back to where you came from!"" has escalated to physical attacks on Asian seniors and finally, the unthinkable and yet logical sequence of events-the mass shooting of Asian women. Some say the killings aren't a hate crime because no such intent was expressed. But lightning has struck me enough times; I recognize what I see. 
We can't wait for attitudes to change. We need the government to protect Asian Americans with action and the full force of the law. The bill sponsored by Representative Meng and Senator Hirono to address the recent hate crimes is a good start. Congress must pass this bill quickly to end the injustice inflicted on Asian Americans. 
(Editor Note: The Senate overwhelming passed the bill this past week. The House will have its own vote. Then the House and Senate will have to work out the differences between the differing bills before it goes to President Biden for his signature)

White supremacy is the root of all race-related violence in the US,"Ho, Jennifer",Others,2021-04-08									,"Amid the disturbing rise in attacks on Asian Americans since March 2020 is a troubling category of these assaults: Black people are also attacking Asian Americans. 
White people are the main perpetrators of anti-Asian racism. But in February 2021, a Black person pushed an elderly Asian man to the ground in San Francisco; the man later died from his injuries. In another video, from New York City on March 29, 2021, a Black person pushes and beats an Asian American woman on the sidewalk in front of a doorway while onlookers observe the attack, then close their door on the woman without intervening or providing aid. 
As the current president of the Association for Asian American Studies and as an ethnic studies and critical race studies professor who specializes in Asian American culture, I wanted to address the climate of anti-Asian racism I was seeing at the start of the pandemic. So in April 2020, I created a PowerPoint slide deck about anti-Asian racism that my employer, the University of Colorado Boulder, turned into a website. That led to approximately 50 interviews, workshops, talks and panel presentations that I've done on anti-Asian racism, specifically in the time of COVID-19. 
The point I've made through all of those experiences is that anti-Asian racism has the same source as anti-Black racism: white supremacy. So when a Black person attacks an Asian person, the encounter is fueled perhaps by racism, but very specifically by white supremacy. White supremacy does not require a white person to perpetuate it. 
It's not just white people 
White supremacy is an ideology, a pattern of values and beliefs that are ingrained in nearly every system and institution in the U.S. It is a belief that to be white is to be human and invested with inalienable universal rights and that to be not-white means you are less than human - a disposable object for others to abuse and misuse. 
The dehumanization of Asian people by U.S. society is driven by white supremacy and not by any Black person who may or may not hate Asians. 
During the pandemic, ""yellow peril"" rhetoric that blamed China for COVID-19 led to a 150% rise in anti-Asian harassment incidents reported to police in 2020. In particular, East Asian Americans or anyone who appeared to be of East Asian heritage or descent became targets for the misplaced anger of people blaming Chinese people or those they thought looked Chinese, even if they were of other ethnic backgrounds, like Japanese, Taiwanese, Korean, Burmese, Thai or Filipino. 
A fear of disease 
White supremacy as the root of racism can be seen in the Latino man in Texas stabbing a Burmese family in March 2020, claiming he did so because they were Chinese and bringing the coronavirus into the U.S. Though the suspect may have mental health problems, his belief that this family posed a threat is driven by the white supremacist ideas of Chinese people being to blame for COVID-19. 
This same rhetoric of blaming anyone perceived to be Chinese for COVID-19 and attacking them has been found in countless reports of harassment, including one by a Vietnamese American woman who was spat at by a white man as she tried to enter a grocery store in March 2021. Four days later, video footage showed a 76-year-old Chinese woman who was punched in the face by a 39-year-old white man, on the same day that a white man killed eight people, including six Asian women, in Atlanta. 
[Get the best of The Conversation, every weekend. Sign up for our weekly newsletter.] 
Stories of individual harassment and violence perpetrated against Asian Americans by white assailants don't always get the same attention as the viral videos of Black aggression toward Asians. 
But underlying all these incidents is white supremacy, just as white supremacy is responsible for Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck for over eight minutes: White supremacy made Floyd into a Black male threat rather than a human being. 
Understanding the depth and reach of this ideology of racism can be challenging, but doing so brings each person, and the nation as a whole, closer to addressing systemic inequity. It's not Black people whom Asian Americans need to fear. It's white supremacy.

"In therapy, clients can cry Therapists flooded with inquiries as Asian communities reckon with longtime mental health crises in wake of Atlanta-area spa shootings ","Evans, Marissa",Others,2021-04-18,"When Linda Yoon, a Korean American psychotherapist, heard about the recent Atlanta-area spa shootings, she braced for what would likely come next. 
After the killing of eight people, including six Asian women, she and the other therapists in her Los Angeles-area practice were flooded with calls and emails from would- be clients. Ninety percent of them were Asian people mentioning the shooting or racial trauma. 
The calls came not just from LA or across Califomia, but also from Alabama, Kansas and even Georgia, with desperate requests for an Asian therapist who could help them cope. 
Since she started the Yellow Chair Collective with a partner in 2019, the out-of-state inquiries were not new for Yoon. But due to overwhelming demand and licensing restrictions that limit practitioners' ability to treat people in other states, Yoon and her fellow therapists felt a sense of helplessness, realizing they could not serve 
everyone. 
""We've been getting a lot more inquiries than we could accommodate,"" Yoon said. ""We've been getting a lot of inquiries out of state where they don't have a lot of Asian providers and that's been hard... we had to turn some Asian clients away."" 
The Atlanta-area shootings amplified the longtime mental health crisis in Asian American and Pacific Islander communities after a year of anti-Asian violence and grief over COVID-19 deaths. 
Experts and advocates say these events also helped expose other shortcomings in the health care system particular to Asian Americans, including a lack of Asian mental health providers, ongoing language barriers and ignorance of Asian culture, histories and the decades of violence they've faced in America. 
During the pandemic, Asian communities are also dealing with displacement from loss of income or the need to move, being without usual support systems because of social distancing and fear of violence inspired by bigoted rhetoric that Asian people are responsible for the virus. 
""It's just making a lot of mental health challenges worse,"" said Mandy Diec, California policy director for the Washington, D.C.-based Southeast Asia Resource Action Center. ""It's really nothing new, but it's something reinforcing a lot of the trauma and it's unfortunate that the biggest problem is that we live in a health care system that doesn't account for the needs of our community."" 
Depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, unresolved trauma and cultural stigma about mental illness are longtime concerns in Asian communities. 
Nearly 44% of Asian Americans who had a past-year major depressive episode received treatment for it, according to the 2018 federal National Survey on Drug Use and Health. 
A report recently released by the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center found that 29% of respondents faced challenges due to an insufficient understanding of mental health services and how to navigate the mental health system. 
Survey participants said they care most about someone understanding their cultural values, roles and expectations, a welcoming environment and an understanding of their community's history. 
Diec said younger generations are ""cultural brokers"" between older adults and the mental health system, helping them make appointments, research therapists and receive care. 
She said Asian American and Pacific Islander communities revolve around family and the collective community, making mental health - often treated individually - a challenging subject to broach because it's not seen as ""necessary or really worthy of talking about."" 
In 2019, there were 4,887 Asian psychologists across the U.S., making up just 4% of the workforce, according to a report from the American Psychological Association. 
Yoon says her Asian clients are struggling to process what happened in the Atlanta area and the violent attacks that have long occurred in their communities. 
Often they've been told by older generations to ignore the racist attacks, work harder and ""don't rock the boat,"" Yoon said. Now they're trying to find the words to explain the traumas of feeling culturally and emotionally invisible. 
""A lot of them were telling me that a lot of companies didn't acknowledge what happened,"" Yoon said of her clients. ""They're feeling the tragedy but their companies, their own managers, are going like it's just a normal day... they're really struggling, and they feel like they want to cry, and it's like, 'OK, when I go to therapy, I can cry.'' 
Kao Saechao, specialty mental health division director for Asian Health Services in Oakland, said the community health center offers mental health services through more than 30 mental health workers and in 14 Asian languages. 
Since the Atlanta shooting, the center has seen an uptick in requests for mental health services. 
""The stigma is still very present in our community. I think there's still a lot of work that could be done to improve that,"" Saechao said. ""And also, somehow just normalizing mental health services and actually educating people on what that means and the benefits of mental health care."" 
Yoon often thinks about the people they've had to turn away. While the practice tries to make referrals to therapists living closer to people making out-of-state inquiries, Yoon says they often have full client lists too. 
Recently Yoon and her business partner went to Big Bear with their families to decompress. But they still found themselves responding to emails and tinkering with how they'll run support groups. 
""We just can't take time off right now,"" Yoon said. ""I feel like we need to be there.""",5574
"Biased rhetoric on China makes US cities unsafe: Josh Selig says the rise in anti-Asian violence might have started with racist depictions of Covid-19, but it has been sustained by American officials calling Beijing aggressive","Selig, Josh",Others,2021-04-14,"My wife and I recently moved to a bigger flat. We are expecting our first child in August and our old one-bedroom place was just not big enough. Our new home overlooks New York Harbour and the Statue of Liberty, a symbol of America that I have loved since I was a child. 
My dad was a Jewish refugee who fled Germany during World War II, and my wife is a recent immigrant from Harbin, a lovely but cold city in northern China. I grew up believing the United States welcomed ""the world's huddled masses yearning to be free"", but these days I have my doubts. 
Last month, a 65-year-old Filipino woman was walking near Times Square in New York when she was attacked by a stranger who beat and kicked her. A few onlookers, including two security guards, watched the attack and did nothing. This assault took place just weeks after the killings of eight people - six of them Asian women - in Atlanta, Georgia. 
Although anti-Asian bias has been around in the US since our nation was founded, there has been a surge of hate crimes against Asians since 2020. What is at the heart of this violence? It might have started with former US president Donald Trump's racist depictions of Covid-19 as the ""China virus"", but it has been perpetuated by labelling China as aggressive. 
In Japan, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned against ""coercion and aggression"" by Beijing, saying the US would ""push back if necessary"". Deputy Defence Secretary Kathleen Hicks recently said Beijing ""has adopted a more coercive and aggressive approach"". 
Is China actually an aggressive country? The US has hundreds of active military bases around the world, perhaps more foreign military bases than any other nation or empire in history. Meanwhile, Beijing has just one military base outside China, in Djibouti. 
Clearly, China is not an aggressor. In fact, historically China has been the victim of aggression by Japanese and Western forces, so much so that the Chinese refer to the 100 years ending with World War II as the ""century of humiliation"". To criticise China for building up its own military in the South China Sea is like criticising a kid who has been bullied for years for taking some self-defence classes. 
If China is not actually an aggressor, why is the US pushing a narrative that it is aggressive? Why is the US encouraging other countries to jump on the anti-China bandwagon? 
I believe the answer is simple. China has had a great run during the past 50 years. It has developed its economy and tech sector and, along the way, it has lifted many Chinese out of poverty. 
As Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told the BBC, ""The US is still number one but number two is not so far behind. That is what is difficult for the US to accept."" Or, as Elon Musk recently said, ""I'm very confident the future of China is going to be great."" 
By presenting China as an aggressor, the US gives itself cover for taking unilateral actions to try to stem China's rise. This demonising of China might feed nationalistic impulses, but it will not help find common ground or build the required trust to ensure China and the US can peacefully coexist. 
By contrast, China is non-confrontational. As State Councillor Yang Jiechi said after the talks in Anchorage, Alaska, ""The two sides should follow the policy of 'no conflict' to guide our path towards a healthy and stable trajectory moving forward."" 
Although US President Joe Biden has spoken eloquently in condemning violence against Asians, the language of the US government still emphasises Chinese aggression. Deliberately or not, this encourages violence against Asians. China-bashing in any form on Capitol Hill inspires actual Asian-American bashing in our streets. Conversely, showing tolerance and respect towards China will inspire tolerance and respect towards Asian-Americans, and this will make our cities safer. 
These days, my wife doesn't leave our flat alone. We're concerned about her safety, as is her family in Harbin. Our daughter is expected in August, and we wonder if she will be welcomed in the US.

worry.

Kim deserves gold for bravery amid anti-Asian hate: Beijing 2022 Games hope reveals how she has been the victim of racial abuse since she was 13,"White, Jonathan ",Others,2021-04-04,"What does it take for social media to realise it might have a social responsibility? How about the racist abuse of a 13-year-old girl? 
That's what US Olympic gold medallist Chloe Kim revealed she suffered following her first X-Games medal, a silver at Aspen in 2014. Since then, Kim says, she has been subject to thousands of such messages up to 30 a day since Covid-19 started. 
- 
It has understandably been a factor in her mental health over the years and she sat out last season because her ""mental health was in a bad place"" - though she claims she is now inured to the idiots. Prompted by a message received just minutes earlier where she was called a ""dumb Asian b****"", Kim shared some of the worst things she was sent on Instagram, explaining why she took the decision in a post midweek. 
""Just to be clear,"" the 20-year-old began an Instagram story. ""These messages don't affect me any more. I've received this type of hate for so many years that I've grown numb to it. But I don't want to allow these people to continue spreading negativity and being blatantly racist on social media. 
""So I've decided to post every single one I see, and I ask you all to report their accounts so they get taken down immediately, and I encourage you all to do the same. And to the haters, I'm sorry, but shut the f*** up. No one cares for your negativity, it's disgusting. Being racist and rude isn't a good look and I genuinely feel sorry for you. It's not that hard to be a decent human being, maybe you should try it out sometime."" Maybe they should but in the meantime sports stars are looking for action from elsewhere, namely social media giants Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Retired footballer Thierry Henry has received support from his sport for walking away from social media but 20-year-old Kim has more on the line in the run-up to Beijing 2022 next year. 
Still Kim, who burst into international prominence at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in 2018 where the 17-year-old won the gold medal in the half-pipe, has become the latest athlete to speak up in the absence of action from the tech companies or legislators. 
Her story warrants attention. While people will debate the right to free speech and anonymity online, even the most libertarian would struggle to stand up for racially abusing a 13-year-old child. 
""I remember the first time I got one of these was when I was 13 and won my first medal at the X Games,"" she wrote. ""An accomplishment I was so incredibly proud of myself for but instead I was getting bashed for being Asian. 
""And honestly. I feel really helpless and afraid at times. I'm really struggling and it's been gut-wrenching to see how so many Asian Americans are being attacked for literally no reason at all."" Now, with the lines blurring between online hate and real-life attacks on the Asian-Americans and Pacific Islander community in the US and elsewhere it really seems like time for authorities to take the athletes' lead and act upon this and make social media a safer place. 
Kim has revealed how offline attacks have led to her taking drastic action. ""I have tasers, pepper spray, a knife. If I go outside to walk my dog or go to the grocery store,"" Kim said. ""My fanny pack has all three of those in it and my hand never leaves my side."" She told ESPN she also fears for her South Korean parents in the current climate and removed the Instagram app from her phone. ""I used to love responding to fans, but I don't look at my messages much any more. Even if you get thousands of supportive messages, the hateful one will hit you the most."" Kim has had to deal with this while preparing to defend her Olympic half-pipe title in Beijing next year and somehow is not distracting her so far. 
Despite that and 22 months away from competition between starting college and sitting last season, Kim has won three golds this year induding gold at the Aspen FIS Snowboard and Freeski World Championships last month to defend her world crown. 
She didn't need to speak out and is all the braver for doing so after keeping silent for years. As one of the few high profile Asian-American women across sport she is an easy target. 
Never mind Beijing 2022, give her a gold medal for being, as she so succinctly put it, a decent human being.",4273
Asian American activists mobilizing for civil rights: Recent attacks have prompted many to speak out for the first time,"Chao, Mary",Others,2021-04-12,"Angry. Hurt. Shocked. 
Those are some of the emotions that have racked Asian Americans in North Jersey after witnessing unprovoked race-based attacks as Asians have been scapegoated for the COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in Wuhan, China. 
But Asian Americans are harnessing that emotion and using it to fuel a mass movement designed to stem the tide of hate against Asians. In cities across the United States in recent weeks, tens of thousands of people took to the streets to demonstrate. 
More than 150 years after Asians first settled in America, Asian Americans are for the first time mobilizing en masse in a civil rights movement. The recent attacks have prompted many to speak out, shedding cultural norms. 
North Jersey is home to some of the largest Asian American communities in the United States. More than 40% of residents in boroughs such as Fort Lee and Leonia identify as Asian, as do nearly 60% of residents in Palisades Park. In recent weeks they took to the streets carrying posters and signs that read ""Stop Asian Hate"" and ""Hate is a Virus."" 
A new generation of North Jersey Asian Americans is spearheading this movement, having grown up in the Garden State feeling isolated. These people have faced racism, but until now brushed it off instead of calling it out. 
Below, some of these new leaders share their stories. 
Brian Jon 
Brian Jon could not believe what he heard. As a freshman at Bergen County Technical Schools in 2017, he learned of an incident at a sister school, Bergen County Academies, in which a Spanish language teacher allegedly announced during class that she hated Korean students. Outraged, he started a petition drive and gathered more than 1,500 signatures to successfully oust the teacher from the school. 
That experience led Jon to further activism. For the 19-year-old, an immigrant who arrived from South Korea at the age of 6 with his mother, Ellen Jeon, life has not been 
easy. 
""The only thing I knew how to say was hello,"" Jon recalled of his arrival in New Jersey. 
He attended schools in Tenafly, raised by his busy single mom. Before long, other kids introduced him to sports such as wrestling, football and swimming. 
Though he assimilated, Jon remains very aware of his Korean American identity. 
""It is our job to be aware of anti-Asian bias,"" Jon said. ""Our parents' generation, Asians are often taught to be very mannered, to be respectful of our elders, so we don't really raise our voices and we normally keep ourselves very shut. We suppress our feelings."" 
In January 2020, Jon launched an organization for like-minded young Asian activists called Asian American Youth Council. There are over 50 student members of the organization advocating for Asian American issues. 
""It's very crucial for us second-generation Asian Americans speak up for our elders,"" he said, noting the spate of hate crimes. ""It is a mandatory thing now."" 
Cecilia Chan and Mia Hur 
Watching news reports about the Atlanta massage spa shootings, Cecilia Chan of Tenafly couldn't sleep. She was convinced it was a case of Asian fetishization, where men fantasize about Asian women in a deviant nature. 
""I was outraged when media tried to spin the narrative of sexual addiction,"" said Chan, who has been victimized by Asian fetishization stereotypes. ""I was completely outraged. It just hit home on so many levels."" 
Meanwhile, Tenafly resident Mia Hur, a real estate agent, purse designer and mother of a teenage son, was also upset about the shootings and that the suspected gunmen was normalized in the media by explaining he had a sexual addiction. She knew she needed to do something. 
Simultaneously, Chan and Hur reached out to elected officials, who asked them to organize. In three days, the duo put together a rally calling for an end to anti-Asian 
hate. 
""I felt hurt. I felt outraged. I felt angry, "" Chan said. 
Hur echoed Chan's sentiments, explaining the current mood of many Asian Americans. 
""A lot of people probably don't understand why it's a big deal to the Asian American community,"" Hur said of the Atlanta shootings. ""It just perpetuates stereotypes, gaslighting our culture."" 
Chan and Hur connected over shared experiences and emotions, organizing the first North Jersey rally against anti-Asian racism after the Atlanta killings. It was held in Tenafly on March 21 and drew more than 800 people. More than a half-dozen vigils followed throughout North Jersey. 
The recent spate of attacks against Asian Americans is opening old wounds for Chan and Hur. The nonprofit group Stop AAPI Hate reported 3,795 anti-Asian incidents since the start of the COVID pandemic, with Asians scapegoated for the coronavirus. 
Now 47, Hur arrived in the United States from South Korea when she was 6. Back then, hers was among a handful of Asian families in Tenafly. 
""It was isolating,"" Hur recalled. ""That really made me aware of my identity."" 
Her parents were busy working as merchants in New York City, so she had to grow up fast. The community of Tenafly was kind and generous to her in her youth, with families inviting her to places and events. Because of its diversity, she and her husband chose to stay in Tenafly to raise their son, now 13. 
Born in New York City to Chinese immigrant parents who owned Chinese restaurants, Chan, 44, describes herself as a recovering lawyer who is now a stay-at-home mom to two children. Her family lived in Westchester County, New York, before moving to Cresskill, where she sometimes felt boxed in. 
Chan and Hur both understand the Asian immigrant experience and that language and culture have been barriers to attaining visibility. 
""We're taught to work hard, keep our heads down, don't make trouble. These are cultural foundations,"" Hur said. ""We wrestle with it. I know our whole community wrestles with it."" 
So Chan is working on helping others in the community speak out. ""There's so much hesitation due to cultural norms,"" she said. 
A goal of the movement is to unify Asian Americans throughout New Jersey and celebrate diversity within diversity. 
""We are made up of different cultures and races from around the world,"" Chan said. ""That's what makes us stronger."" 
Chris Chung 
As he was growing up in a Korean immigrant household in Tenafly, assimilation was difficult for Chris Chung. He arrived in the United States at the age of 11 in 1978 and was among the few immigrant children in his school. While other classmates' parents attended school events and cheered for their children, Chung's parents were busy working at the family business, a general merchandise store in Brooklyn, and later a wholesale fine jewelry business. 
""I envied other children's parents attending events, from sporting events to school events,"" said Chung, 53. ""That always stuck with me."" As a result, he always thought that when he grew up and had children, he would make sure he was part of their education. 
— 
As an adult living in Palisades Park - and wanting his children to enjoy a life he did not have Chung, a real estate agent, decided to get involved in local politics. Initially he ran for school board and then a Borough Council seat before being elected mayor in a contentious race against incumbent James Rotundo in 2018. An online tirade by Rotundo's mother against the town's large Korean community went viral. 
Lorraine Rotundo posted on Facebook shortly after her son learned that the Democratic primary race in June of 2018 was too close to call. 
""Go to hell PALISADES PARK, let the GD KOREANS have this F'n town,"" she wrote. ""All of us AMERICANS are so done. I am going to suggest that only English be spoken in our Boro Hall at least while an AMERICAN is still the mayor."" 
Rotundo apologized for her post. More than 300 Korean Americans took to the streets to protest. 
Now in his third year as mayor, Chung reflects on his role as leader of a community that is almost 60% Asian. 
""My whole purpose is to serve the community,"" Chung said. ""I'm not title-hungry."" 
Since taking office, Chung has implemented changes such as hiring Korean-speaking staff to serve residents and translating the borough's website into Korean and Spanish.

Anti-Asian racism is real. We must stand against it.,"Wang, Yafeng",Others,2021-04-04,"Two years ago, I rented a room in an apartment owned by a middle-aged white man who lived there himself. Five days after I moved in, I decided that the apartment was not a good fit. Fortunately, the rental agreement was month-to-month. I told my landlord about my decision to move out the following month. He agreed. 
Two days later, I returned home to find one of my sandals (which I wore at home) slashed open by a knife. Then I found a new Post-it note near the bathroom door. On the left side of the paper, there was a drawing of my landlord wearing a scarf, smiling. A sentence was written in all caps on the right side: ""MY SCARF COSTS MORE THAN YOUR LIFE!"" 
I was terrified. I wasn't sure why my landlord did this, but I didn't need to know his intent to be afraid. The slashed sandal and the words on the note were enough. I had encountered racist acts toward me before. I had been following news about violent acts against Asians in America for years. I didn't find it hard to believe that someone in America could regard my life as cheaper and more disposable than his scarf. 
Anti-Asian racism has existed in the United States for a long time. The COVID-19 pandemic brought it into the spotlight. In the past year, I have seen an endless stream of news reports about people of Asian descent being shunned, spit and coughed at, verbally harassed, punched, shoved, kicked, slashed, stabbed and killed. Asian-owned businesses have been vandalized. People of Asian descent have been refused services, barred from transportation and discriminated against in the workplace. Asian American health care workers, who risked their lives fighting the pandemic on the front lines, have been told to ""go back to China."" 
Stop AAPI Hate, an organization that tracks hate crimes against Asians and Pacific Islanders, reported nearly 3,800 incidents between March 19, 2020, and Feb. 28, 2021. The AAPI report also stated that the actual number of hate crimes was likely much higher, as many hate crimes went unreported. 
Yet, despite all the evidence, many Americans, including many in positions of power, still refuse to acknowledge 
that anti-Asian racism is real. 
I watched in horror the news coverage of the Atlanta-area spa shootings on March 16. The alleged shooter, a 21-year-old white man, specifically targeted Asian-owned spas. He murdered eight people, including six Asian women. Authorities investigating the killings, however, insisted that the motivation behind the killings was unclear. They were quick to cite the alleged killer's self-professed ""sex addiction"" as an alternative explanation. Much of the ensuing public debates focused on whether the killer's actions constituted hate crimes. 
I was outraged. The killer apparently regarded the Asian women who worked at the spas as temptations to be eliminated. He thought the lives of these Asian women were so inconsequential that he could erase them to cure his supposed sexual obsession. If this is not racist, if this is not sexist, if this is not hateful, what is? 
The Atlanta-area spa shootings were not isolated, random events. They occurred in the context of numerous recent attacks on Asians by non-Asians. Why are so many people so fixated on arguing that the Atlanta-area shootings were not a racially motivated hate crime? I think the main reason is that they don't want to accept that anti-Asian racism is systemic and deeply rooted in this country. They refuse to see how pervasive anti- Asian racism is and how devastating it has been for the Asian and Asian American communities before and since the pandemic. 
A few days ago, I watched in horror the video of a brutal attack on a 65-year-old Asian woman of Filipino descent in Manhattan. The assailant kicked the elderly woman to the ground and continued stomping on her while shouting anti-Asian statements. The assailant then walked away. Three men in a nearby building stood, watched and did nothing. A security guard then closed the door to the building and watched the struggling woman through the glass door. 
It is heartbreaking to see the most vulnerable members of our Asian communities being the targets of these brutal assaults. It was infuriating to see the security guard closing the door on the woman as if the violence she just experienced had not occurred at all. 
We need to do something about anti-Asian racism - every one of us. We can't just watch these horrific acts of violence in news reports and then go back to our everyday routines, business as usual. Doing nothing is complicity; it means that we don't care. 
There are many things that we can do even if we are not activists. Donate to organizations that support Asian American communities. Enroll in bystander intervention training to know what to do when we see harassment of Asian people. Learn about the histories and lived experiences of Asian Americans. When an Asian friend or family member shares experiences of racism, listen with compassion. Let them know that they are not alone, and we are with them. 
Anti-Asian racism is real. Let us acknowledge it and do something about it together.

"Since 2020, reports of such violence against Asian women in particular have skyrocketed","Zhou, Taylor",Others,2021-04-07,"In 2008, the Seattle Times reported on a disturbing trend: ""Seattle police bike officers have increased their patrols of the Beacon Hill neighborhood in response to the latest in nearly two dozen sexual attacks on Asian girls and women"" since 2006. 
The New York Times highlighted a list of grievances by San Franciscans in a May 2, 2010 article: ""An 83-year old Chinese man beaten to death by five boys on a Bayview street and a 57-year-old woman injured after being thrown off a Third Street Muni platform. On April 16, two teenagers in Oakland assaulted Tian Sheng Yu, a 59-year-old Chinese immigrant, in broad daylight. A punch knocked him to the ground; the fall killed him."" 
By 2016, the rise in crime so troubled New York's congressional members that they sent a letter to the NYPD. As summarized, ""Asian/Pacific Islander' was the only category for which the percentage of victims increased for every type of crime. The data comes from yearly reports compiled by the NYPD between 2008 and 2014 that categorize victims, suspects and arrestees according to race or ethnicity."" Although ""crime numbers have not gone up,"" police chief George Gascon deployed additional officers to the neighborhood to allay fears. 
On Wednesday morning March 17, 2021, the first mass shooting since the pandemic made headlines. Six of the eight victims killed at the massage parlors in Atlanta were Asian women. 
The response from the spokesman of the Cherokee County Sheriff Office Captain Jay Baker was that the shooter, Robert Aaron Long, ""was pretty much fed up and kind of at the end of his rope"" and that Tuesday ""was a really bad day for him, and this is what he did"". This did not sit well with those who endured a year of lockdowns and watched with disquiet the events around the country. 
According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a unit of the U.S. Department of Justice, 76% of violent crimes against Asian were perpetrated by non-Asians in 2018. 
When Professor Yaeji Kim reported to the NYPD that she was pepper sprayed by two men in a van on her way home in February, I was jolted by the realization that the water bottle tossed at me, the summer before the pandemic, may not have been intended for the garbage can as I'd thought. 
That is small potatoes compared to being urinated on as Kathy Chen endured on her subway ride, or slugged in the face unprovoked or slashed by a knife. Seventy-six year old San 
Franciscan grandma Xiao Zhen Xie was brave. She put her attacker, half her age, on a stretcher. (Disclosure: I bought the t-shirt Jonathan Chang designed in her tribute.) 
By May 2020, we learned that of the nearly 1,500 COVID-related incidents reported between March and April to the group AP3CON, 70% were against women. The latest stats from the nearly 4,000 reports following the one-year anniversary of the pandemic concluded that women were 2.3 times more likely to have reported attacks. Seniors came in second. 
As former FBI analyst James Nolan noted in the New York Times article ""Hate Crime Violence Hits 16-Year High"", ""It doesn't make [crime stats] useless that they're underreported. You have to be savvy enough to look at the trend lines and see the trends. It tells you something about what's going on."" 
Long confessed to the shootings, but he told police they were not racially motivated. He suffered from sex addiction and wanted to eliminate temptations. In research for her 2006 book The Asian Mystique, author Sheridan Prasso found that ""Asian women fetishes far, by far, exceed any other fetishes available on the internet."" 
Prasso would argue that Long's victims are inescapable from the ""images, expectations and misperceptions that lead us to see Asia [Asians] as exotic, sensual, decadent, dangerous, and mysterious."" Further, ""despite - and because of centuries of East-West interaction, the stereotypes of Western literature, stage, and screen remain pervasive icons: the tea-pouring, submissive, sexually available geisha girl..."" 
In reality, as noted in an interview with Sheridan, ""Women in the developed cities of Asia today are every bit as ""modern"" as women in America... But because of the myths created by our images... the ideas of Asia [Asians] as exotic, sensual and decadent persist, too."" 
More ironic, modern ""Asia has had more women leaders in politics than America has. Asia was the first region in the world to elect a woman as head of government, back in the 1960s. The Philippines has had two women presidents already, and there are more Philippine women representing that country as ambassadors than there are 
American women representing America. And yet when we think about ""Filipinas"" we tend to think of maids, mail order brides, and nurses, rather than presidents and ambassadors!"" 
More balanced stories and less-exoticized portrayals of Asians/Asian Americans would go a long way toward dispelling out-dated stereotypes. 
Stop AAPI Hate March 16 at 9:00 AM 
This morning we released our latest national report tracking anti-AAPI hate incidents during the pandemic. From March 2020 to February 2021. Stop AAPI Hate received a total of 3.795 hate incident reports from individuals in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Our data offer proof of the size and scope of the tragedy that is anti- Asian racism and xenophobia in the United States.

NYPD Creates a Hate-Crime Board,"Chapman, Ben",Others,2021-04-20					,"The New York Police Department is creating a civilian panel to help address a rise in hate crimes in New York City, department officials said Monday. 
The NYPD Hate Crime Review Panel will help officers identify potential hate crimes occurring in New York City, said New York Police Department Commissioner Dermot Shea. 
The panel will assess circumstances that present challenges in establishing whether race, national origin, ethnicity, religion, disability or sexual orientation were motivating factors in possible hate crimes, he said. 
The NYPD will send cases it considers challenging to the panel for its recommendation to help determine whether evidence the department has gathered might indicate a hate crime. 
The panel will work on crimes targeting all races. Its five volunteer members include Devorah Halberstam, co-founder and director of external affairs of the Jewish Children's Museum, and Fred Teng, president of the America China Public Affairs Institute, Mr. Shea said. 
""Unfortunately, today we are facing nearly daily reports of hate crimes. We need to help stop this,"" Ms. Halberstam said. 
Mr. Teng, in an interview Monday, said he is honored to participate in the panel's work. 
The NYPD recorded 135 hate crimes from Jan. 1 through April 18, up 45% from 93 in the same period in 2020, according to department figures. 
An increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans has propelled the overall rise, the figures show. Asians were targeted in 66 hate crimes from Jan. 1 through April 18, up from 12 such crimes in the same period in 2020. 
NYPD officials have said some of the attacks on Asian-Americans have been motivated by the false belief that Asians are responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic. Reports of hate crimes against Asians have increased in cities across the U.S. during the pandemic. 
New York City had the biggest increase in reports of hate crimes against Asians of any U.S. city last year, according to a study published by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. 
Efforts by local, state and federal agencies to address the issue have intensified since the March shootings at Atlanta-area spas in which eight people, including six women of Asian descent, were killed. 
Among its efforts, the NYPD last year created an Asian hate-crime task force, staffed by detectives of Asian descent, to investigate such crimes. As more incidents were reported in 2021, the department began to deploy undercover officers in an effort to discourage 
anti-Asian violence.

Time to speak out on anti-Asian hate crimes ,"Le, Phoung",Others,2021-04-04,"Earlier in February, a 36-year-old Asian man was stabbed in the back in Manhattan's Chinatown. Watching the replay of the attack, I realized that the victim could have been me an Asian man who walked alone in the same area a year ago. 
― 
Although Asians and Asian-Americans have been continuously attacked amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, hate crime charges by these communities are very rare. A survey published in 2020 found that 31% of Asian American adults have been subjected to racial slurs, yet only 3,800 hate crime reports were received by the Stop AAPI Hate organization in the past year - a very small percentage of 22 million Asian Americans. 
A reason behind victims' hesitancy to report an incident is the element of behavior in connection to race. Oftentimes, the older generation of Asian immigrants is the quiet minority who might not feel the need to stand up for themselves. ""My difficulty, or reluctance, in speaking about my anger isn't because I'm not infuriated, (but because) I've been trained to suppress my rage,"" expressed Claudine Ko, an editor at the New York Times. Addressing this point of view of older Asian immigrants and Asian Americans can help change reporting patterns of the future. 
The solution starts with the Asian immigrants' children, a younger generation who may be more politically engaged and can use their involvement to change their parents' behavior. But what if the children themselves are the quiet people who cannot manage to have sensitive 
conversations with their parents? A study conducted by Asian American researchers found that Asian American college students have very low utilization rates of mental health services despite showing high levels of psychological distress. In fact, Asian American females from 15 to 24 years old have the highest rate of depressive symptoms among young women. 
If we can promote mental health services better and target the needs of Asian and Asian American college students, we can help students realize the importance of mental health and the need to discuss serious topics like racism. At the University of Rochester, the president expressed her condolences to the AAPI community after the Atlanta shooting and reiterated on-campus mental health resources. Workshops led by Asian voices and a candlelight vigil were hosted by student organizations to address recent hate crime incidents and to let students share their feelings. Besides these steps, higher education institutions should also promote online resources allowing for direct participation in antiracist activities. Reporting hate crime incidents at Stop AAPI Hate and donating to the Hate Is A Virus organization are just some of the many steps that could be advocated for. 
It is time for Asians and Asian Americans, regardless of our age, to un-suppress our rage and speak about our thoughts, loud and clear.

Community gathers for rally to protest anti-Asian sentiment,"DeLetter, Emily",Others,2021-04-12,"WEST LAFAYETTE - Saturday's threat of rain did little to deter the crowd that gathered outside of West Lafayette's Sonya L. Margerum City Hall, a group who came together to protest and rally against Asian hate and discrimination around the country. 
The rally, organized by members of West Lafayette's Chinese community, partnered with the city of West Lafayette, YWCA Greater Lafayette, Purdue Student Government and Greater Lafayette Immigrant Allies. 
The crowd of over 100 people listened to speeches from advocates including West Lafayette Mayor John Dennis and City Council member Gerald Thomas. Purdue Student Government President Assata Gilmore read a statement from City Council member and Purdue student Shannon Kang, who was not at the rally. 
""We have such a significant influence from our international population in West Lafayette, and it has turned us into a community that doesn't just recognize when there is abuse going on in our country, when there is hate flying around in our country,"" Dennis said. ""This city turns into an activist city whenever that type of hatred and mistreatment happens."" 
Dennis cited a national study from Stop AAPI Hate, which found over 3,700 reported incidents to the group from March 2020 to Feb. 28 of this year. According to the report's findings, the two largest types of discrimination reported were verbal harassment, at 68.1% and shunning, or the deliberate avoidance of Asian Americans, was found at 20.5% of the reports. 
""We have to stop this type of violence, we have to stop this type of racism, and we need to make sure we treat each other with respect, honoring their culture, honoring their place of origin and honoring what they are doing to contribute to this community,"" Dennis said. 
Kang, who had her statement read by Gilmore, is also currently the Purdue Student Government-president elect. Once she takes office for the next academic year, she will be the first Asian-American woman to hold that position. 
""It isn't just within these past few weeks that I felt I stand out in a crowd, and it isn't the first time I felt I could be terrorized or threatened by hateful speech or actions,"" part of Kang's statement read. ""But I'd like to voice that I feel supported by this community."" 
Asian Americans and those of Asian descent living in the U.S. have reported an increase of serious incidents of online hate and harassment as racist and xenophobic slurs blaming people of Asian descent for the coronavirus pandemic spread over the past year, according to a survey shared with USA TODAY. 
The survey, conducted by the ADL (Anti-Defamation League), reported that around 17% of Asian American reported sexual harassment, stalking, physical threats and other incidents, up from 11% last year. 
USA TODAY reported that half of them said the harassment was spurred by their race or ethnicity, according to the survey from anti-hate group ADL. Overall, 21% of Asian-American respondents said they were harassed online. 
Saturday's rally follows the fatal shootings of eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at Atlanta-area massage parlors March 16. 
After the speeches, the crowd, many holding signs, marched around the block and concluded the rally with a song from children of local Chinese families. 
Rally organizer and moderator Shan Chen, who has lived in West Lafayette for around 10 years, said she recognized the surge of anti-Asian crimes and sentiments around the country, especially with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""We need to raise awareness about this,"" Chen said. ""We are not living on an isolated island, and if there are things like this around the country it will affect us sooner or later."" 
Chen met with city leaders, and got in touch with City Council member Kathy Parker, who originally asked to hold a vigil for the Atlanta shooting victims. Eventually the idea for the vigil turned into Saturday's rally after she received support from local families in the community. 
""The rally is over, but we still have work to do,"" Chen said. ""We are a safe community, but there are still Asian American members who don't feel as safe as before. But, we are afraid that if we stay silent and don't do anything, things could get worse nationally.""

VP Leni appeals to United States gov't to ensure safety of Asians,None,Others,2021-04-05,"Manila, April 5 United States President Joseph Biden Jr. must ensure the safety of all Asians and minority groups, including Filipinos, amid the recently increasing hate crimes against people of Asian descent in the US, Vice President Leni Robredo said on Monday, April 5. 
In a statement, the vice president lamented the recent attacks against Asians in the United States, saying that they were ""deeply concerning, and an appalling turn of events."" 
""At a time when the world should come together in solidarity against the greater threat of the pandemic, Asians, some of them Filipinos, have been singled out as targets of rage and racial hatred. This has contributed to a climate of growing fear in an atmosphere already made volatile by COVID-19,"" she said. 
""Hatred has no place in any society that wishes to heal,"" Robredo added. 
The lady official said she was hopeful that the Biden administration ""will ensure the safety of all Asians and minority groups, even as it works to address the deeper issues of racism and racial violence."" 
""Towards this common goal, we stand as allies of the American people, behind a long history of friendship and a shared commitment to upholding democratic values and the dignity of every human being,"" Robredo said. 
Foreign media called the recent attacks on Asian-Americans ""COVID hate crimes"" as the spate of killings and attacks happen as some sectors of the American public blamed Asians for the spread of the coronavirus and their eventual loss of jobs, income, and lives. 
Just recently, an elderly Filipino-American woman was attacked in New York City by a man whose mother was believed to have died from COVID-19. The elderly woman was walking down the street when the man suddenly kicked her in the stomach and continued to do so even as she fell on the ground. 
Another elderly Filipino-American who was in a New York City subway was slashed in the face with a box cutter. This is not only happening in New York. Asian hate crimes are happening all over the US as California sets up additional patrols in Chinatown because of the growing assaults on Asians there. 
In March, Biden urged the USCongress to pass the hate crime legislation. He also established a COVID-19 Equity Task Force committee to address and end xenophobia against Asian Americans.During his first week in office, Biden also signed an executive action that banned the use of anti-China rhetoric in the federal government that was prevalent during the time of former President Donald Trump.

"No 'model minority': Our stories are unique, rich, and deserve to be told.","Wang, Leo",Others,2021-04-04,"'Ihope you're not from China,"" one patient tells me. ""You look like you could be."" 
As an Asian American physician at the front line of the coronavirus pandemic, I have received multiple comments like this one. In the last year I have attempted to reconcile these experiences with the hardships other Asian Americans have faced. I share in their outrage over the anti-Asian rhetoric that has caused us insufferable harm but I see some ""silver lining"" in that Asian Americans may finally have a voice. 
I was born in China to two physicians. My parents grew up during the Cultural Revolution and were victims of its devastating economic and social consequences. Given their educational achievement, they were blessed to emigrate in pursuit of a better future for me. Leaving their family behind, my parents strapped the last of the little money they had to their name to my 4-year-old self when we boarded our flight to Canada so that if I were lost in a foreign country, I would be cared for. 
Limited by language barriers, my mother worked cleaning jobs while my father pursued a Ph.D. and postdoctoral training. We lived in a modest one-bedroom apartment above a small Chinese business in Toronto. When my brother was born, we moved to New Jersey. My mother took a job as a lab technician and my father started medical residency. He then moved to pursue two medical fellowships before taking his first job as a physician in Canada just shy of his 50th birthday. When my father moved, my mother stayed behind to work a fulltime job while raising my brother and me. 
Through my parents' sacrifices, I went on to earn multiple degrees en route to becoming a physician and engineer. My brother is in medical school studying to become a surgeon. We have gone on to epitomize the model minority stereotype as successful Asian Americans in STEM fueled by family values and strong work ethics. We are a privileged Asian American family with a common story so compelling some viewed it as the American Dream. 
But this old ""model minority"" narrative oversimplifies our experiences and undermines all that families like mine withstood. My parents left their families behind in China and could not be around when my grandparents passed. My parents have spent most of their adult lives apart - my mother a single parent, and my father hundreds of miles from his family. My father retrained in medicine for two decades before taking his first job. My mother surrendered her career and ambition to raise her children. 
I grew up facing discrimination and xenophobia. I lied that I was born in Canada instead of China to fit in. I took an American name, Leo, when my teachers made no effort to pronounce my real name, Le (the Chinese word for joy). I was embarrassed bringing Chinese food to school and having friends over to my house. I spoke only Chinese to my parents because I didn't want others to hear their accent in English. I acted blasé and ""cool,"" titillated when I was told that I was ""not like other Asians,"" fearing that I might be labeled studious. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, I treated patients who saw me as disingenuous and accused me of carrying the coronavirus. And despite everything my family has endured, I am told that my experiences are too ""one-dimensional,"" that I need more ""personality"" to prove I'm not the stereotype of a work-obsessed ""grind."" 
It is a tragedy how marginalized stories like mine have become under the pretense of the model minority. This tale of rags to riches diminishes the deep history of Asian Americans, everything we have overcome, and the diversity in our experiences. It pits Asian Americans against other minorities, and suggests that discrimination must not exist if Asian Americans can be successful. It is ignorant to the flawed system through which some succeeded in spite of, not because of. 
Three years ago, I was invited to speak at the Huaxia Chinese School's Chinese New Year Gala. I delivered a message about finding solidarity in the Chinese American community by embracing and sharing our experiences. With everything Asian Americans have been through in the last year, there has never been a better time to reject the model minority myth. 
As our nation heals, we have to remind others that Asian Americans at all levels contribute to the fabric of America. We have a rich history filled with unique stories, and we deserve to tell them. Through these stories, we demonstrate that we share in the resilience and triumph of the human spirit. And if we can discover these commonalities, we can find a way forward together.

Funds to tackle Asian American hate crimes,None,Others,2021-04-02,"Headnote 
US WILL RECORD DATA ON VIOLENT ATTACKS AND SET UP XENOPHOBHIA TASK FORCE 
THE administration of US president loe Biden on Tuesday (30) announced measures responding to rising anti-Asian violence, including deploying $49.5 million (£36m) from Covid-19 relief funds for US community programmes that help victims. 
White House officials said the Department of Justice is also focusing on a rising number of hate crimes targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. 
""We can't be silent in the face of rising violence against Asian Americans,"" Biden wrote on Twitter. ""These attacks are wrong, un-American, and must stop."" 
The measures come after a shooting in Atlanta earlier this month left eight people dead, six of them Asian-American women. 
The shooting stoked fears among those in the Asian-American Pacific Islander community, which has reported a spike in hate crimes since March 2020 when then president Donald Trump began referring to the coronavirus as the ""China virus."" 
Biden's new steps include $49.5m of pandemic relief funds for ""community based, culturally specific services and programmes for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault"" as well as a new task force dedicated to countering xenophobia against Asians in healthcare. 
The Justice Department is also planning new efforts to enforce hate crime laws and report data on racial crimes, the statement said. 
A shooting rampage in March left six women of Asian origin dead and stoked fears among Asian Americans who were already alarmed by a surge in hate crimes during the corona-virus pandemic. 
Three massage parlours around Atlanta were targeted on March 16, before a 21-year-old man suspected of the killings was arrested in south-west Georgia. Police investigating motives have not ruled out the possibility that the attacks were provoked, at least in part, by anti-immigrant or anti-Asian sentiments. 
""Hate can have no safe harbour in America. It must stop. And it is on all of us, all of us together, to make it stop,"" Biden said in March, after meeting leaders and state lawmakers from the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community following the Atlanta shooting. 
He was accompanied by vice-president Kamala Harris, the first Asian-American holder of the office in US history. 
Harris likened it to the targeting of Muslims after the September 11, 2001, attacks. She said, ""Racism is real in America, and it has always been. Xenophobia is real in America, and always has been. Sexism, too."" 
""The president and I will not be silent. We will not stand by. We will always speak out against violence, hate crimes and discrimination wherever and whenever it occurs,"" Harris added. 
Hate crimes against Asian Americans increased by 149 per cent in 2020 in 16 major cities compared with 2019, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. 
The violent incidents included people being slashed with a box cutter, being set on fire and subjected to verbal harassment, according to testimony at a US congressional hearing on anti-Asian violence convened in March. 
Last week, New York City said it planned to deploy an all-Asian undercover police team and expand community outreach in more than 200 languages to combat a rise in hate crimes against the community. 
""If you are going to commit a hate crime in New York City, we will find you,"" New York City police commissioner Dermot Shea said while unveiling the two-pronged plan to fight bias crimes. 
""We are not going to tolerate anyone being targeted because of the colour of their skin, the religion they worship, their sexual preference or anything else,"" Shea added. (Agencies)

UC's Pinto partners with Asian advocates student group ,"Mitchell, Madeline ",Others,2021-04-11,"University of Cincinnati president Neville Pinto is standing with the United Asian Advocates student group against anti-Asian racism, he said in a statement released late Thursday evening. 
The students submitted six demands to the university in late March after they were ""Zoom-bombed"" during a virtual Asian leadership panel event on Feb. 23. Aashka Raval, co-president of United Asian Advocates, told The Enquirer the group had been in discussions about the demands before that, when an adjunct instructor referred to COVID-19 as ""the Chinese virus"" in an email to a student. UC did not renew its contract with John Ucker for the spring semester after investigating the incident. 
At least two people unmuted themselves during the February Zoom panel and started ""spewing hate"" more than 40 minutes into the event, Raval said. One of the disruptors called a member of the United Asian Advocates a ""cow"" and told her to ""go back to India."" 
""I want to commend (United Asian Advocates) for speaking out on the rising levels of violence, discrimination and xenophobia directed at Asians and Asian Americans across the nation,"" Pinto, who was born in Mumbai, India, said. ""I stand with them in denouncing the bigoted comments made by unwelcomed visitors to their virtual meeting earlier this semester. Such disturbing examples of hate and racism cannot be tolerated."" 
Of the nearly 36,000 undergraduate students enrolled at UC in the 2020-2021 school year, 4.7% identify as Asian and 6.4% identify as international, according to the university's website. 
Pinto met with the student organization on Thursday. In a message to The Enquirer Friday morning, Raval said she thought it was ""productive."" 
In his Thursday statement, Pinto said he looks forward to partnering with United Asian Advocates and other supporters across campus moving forward. 
""As an academic community, we must strive every single day to create a truly diverse, inclusive, equitable, safe and supportive environment,"" Pinto said. 
The United Asian Advocates' demands are detailed on their website and summarized below: 
A no-tolerance video or written statement from Pinto addressing xenophobic and racist incidents against Asian identifying people on campus and beyond. 
Implementation of a universitywide bias reporting tool moderated by the office of equity and inclusion, based on the current system through the College of Arts and Sciences. The tool must be highlighted in the syllabus and at student orientations. 
Recruit, hire and retain a staff member with experience supporting Asian-identifying students and organizations for the Office of Ethnic Programs and Services. 
Recruit, hire and retain at least one qualified individual with experience working with Asian mental health care and racial trauma at the UC Counseling and Psychological Services. 
Develop mandatory anti-racism training, similar to the alcohol awareness and sexual harassment training currently required by the university, for incoming university first- year students. 
Include a Multicultural Center in the Next Lives Here expansion plans to highlight, support and empower all marginalized racial, ethnic and cultural identities at UC. ",3191
Miranda Devine: Defunding NYPD triggers sadistic hate crimes,"Devine, Miranda",Others,2021-04-28									,"Security video shows he gratuitously felled her with a punch to the head as he walked by and then kicked her repeatedly in the face. 
The attack was one of a spate of vicious unprovoked hate crimes against Asian-Americans in the city, almost all committed by black men. 
Pastry chef Yao Pan Ma, the victim of another attack, came to New York from his native China two years ago for a dream job and a better life. 
COVID killed his job and now some thug has almost killed him. The sickening beating on Friday night in Harlem was as sadistic and unprovoked as any we have seen. 
In my building, women of Asian appearance now are afraid to go out to buy groceries and are turning to volunteer group, SafeWalx, which offers walking companions to the Asian community. 
This is no way to live. But it's what happens when foolish politicians demonise, defund and disempower the NYPD, while mollycoddling criminals and racial justice warriors who abuse police for sport. No wonder cops are quitting in droves. 
As anti-police protests escalate, and violent crime spirals out of control, a mass exodus is under way from police forces across the country. 
More than 5300 NYPD officers have retired or quit this year, the New York Post reported on the weekend, a 75 per cent increase from last year. 
They should find easier work as private security for the wealthy woke, who are insulated from the consequences of their own virtue.

But never fear, New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson has a plan to make things worse. 
On the weekend he announced the city's latest tranche of anti-cop legislation. 
Johnson wants former NYPD officers permanently banned from taking other law enforcement jobs if they have been subject to disciplinary action. 
Johnson made his announcement at Reverend Al Sharpton's Harlem headquarters, a few blocks from where Yao Pan Ma now lies in a coma. 
He offered no words of comfort to Ma's wife and no solutions to the violent crime epidemic.

"Asian community in state feels sting of hate: 'Although their voices have been silenced, their stories will not be forgotten.' Those in Delaware have endured everything from racial slurs to thrown rocks","Castañeda Perez, José Ignacio ",Others,2021-04-01,"""We will not be silent. We must be the voice of our own community."" 
Jin Twilley 
President of the Delaware Korean 
Association and a Korean immigrant 
For a brief moment, after all of the lights in the church had abruptly gone out, the eight glowing candles on the altar radiated the only source of light in the entire building. 
Each candle represented one of the eight victims who lost their lives in the March 16 Atlanta-area spa shootings - Soon Chung Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, Yong Ae Yue, Delaina Ashley Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Tan and Daoyou Feng. 
The shootings were the culmination of a year when hate crimes against those of Asian descent rose almost 150% in America's largest cities, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. In this particular spate of violence, six of the victims were Asian women and four of them Korean immigrants. 
Shu-Chien Liang, a representative from the Chinese School of Delaware, saw herself reflected in the lives of the victims because she is also a mother, a woman and a proud Asian American. 
""Like many of those before us, [the victims] came to America to pursue a better life for their children and their families, often taking a lower-paying job than they could have in their native land,"" she said. ""Although their voices have been silenced, their stories will not be forgotten."" 
Liang said the victims continued to work toward their idea of the American dream despite the COVID-19 pandemic and a growing amount of discrimination against their communities. 
""I hope we can take inspiration from their stories and work together so that future Asian Americans, and Americans of all cultures, will be equal partners of America and fully realize their American dreams,"" Liang said. 
About 100 people gathered at Grace United Methodist Church on Sunday evening to mourn the victims of the shootings, as well as the victims of anti-Asian violence. Several community organizers, lawmakers, allies and representatives from local Asian American associations and schools spoke at the event, including U.S. Sen. Tom Carper and New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer. 
The candles, eight in total, were lit one at a time after the name of the person was announced and a large silver bell was rung in remembrance. 
Since March 2020, Asian Americans have reported nearly 3,800 hate incidents, according to a report by Stop AAPI Hate. 
David Kim, an assistant professor of digital humanities at the University of Delaware and a community organizer, described hate incidents inflicted against him both before and after the pandemic began. These incidents ranged from hearing racial slurs directed at him to having rocks thrown at him. 
""It was traumatic and hurtful but also, and this might be the most depressing part of it, it's like 'OK, like what are you going to do?"""" Kim said. 
The recent violence has been directed at the entire Asian American Pacific Islander community, Kim said, despite the range of diversity within it. Kim mentioned the 
different ethnicities, nationalities, citizenship status, genders and social classes that compose the community as a whole. 
But the Atlanta victims, Kim said, represent the ""most vulnerable"" portion of Asian communities and of American society as a whole. 
""There exists a shared history and experience in Asian America, but it is also crucially important to recognize that this was based on their race, based on their gender and based on their devalued labor status,"" Kim said, ""that a 'bad day' turned into a tragedy."" 
Kim was referring to a press conference soon after the shootings where Capt. Jay Baker, the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office spokesman, said that the suspect had a ""bad day."" The comment drew fierce blowback on social media, and Baker has since been removed as spokesman for the case. 
The Atlanta shooting suspect's motives are not yet clear. 
Jin Twilley, president of the Delaware Korean Association and a Korean immigrant, reiterated the importance of speaking out against the violence toward Asian American communities. 
""We will not be silent. We must be the voice of our own community,"" she said. ""We all must know racism, discrimination and violence against Americans, and Asian Americans in particular, is not new this year and, unfortunately, this pain we are all grieving over is not an isolated exposure problem only to Asians."" 
The sharp hike in hate crimes and violence has increased the amount of fear felt in Asian American communities across the country. While violence and discrimination against Asian Americans have risen in the last year, it is not new. 
The U.S. has a long history of discrimination and violence toward the Asian community. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which restricted Chinese immigrants from entering the U.S. for 10 years. 
Then, in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attacks, the federal government incarcerated more than 100,000 people of Japanese descent, most of whom were American citizens, in internment camps. 
Vivian Louie, director of the Asian American Studies Center and Program at Hunter College in New York, attributed the rise of anti-Asian violence in the past year to divisive rhetoric used by former President Donald Trump to characterize the COVID-19 virus and the worsening pandemic. 
""President Trump very skillfully tapped into what has been there for as long as Asians have been in the United States,"" Louie said, ""which is the perception of them as the perpetual foreigner, the forever foreigner."" 
The perpetual foreigner stereotype, which Louie mentioned, frames ethnic minorities as continuous outsiders in the U.S. who are often depicted as enemies to American interests. This stereotype associates different minorities and people with externalized national threats to the U.S., like the trade war with China, Louie said. 
In his speech at the vigil, David Kim also described the perpetual foreigner stereotype and how it has been a hallmark of the Asian American experience since the arrival of Asians in the U.S. 
""As 'perpetual foreigners,' regardless of our individual places in the U.S., it has meant that our experiences and our racial injury haven't really mattered,"" he said. 
In addition to divisive rhetoric, sexualized and submissive stereotypes of Asian women have been linked to increasing rates of violence in the past, according to the National Network to End Domestic Violence. 
Louie stressed the importance of education in order to help curb anti-Asian violence and discrimination in the future. Asian American studies in higher education, K-12 education and community-based programs are essential to move forward, Louie said. 
""That's something we can definitely do, but we can't do it if it's not on the radar screen,"" she said. ""This is a moment of dialogue, learning and coalition building. That's how change happens."" 
The vigil was put together soon after the shootings by local community leaders, Julissa Coriano, April Pags and David Kim. 
Toward the end of the vigil, the power in the church went out due to a thunderstorm, but the stories continued. Attendees raised the flashlights on their phones to illuminate the remainder of the event and the voices behind it. 
""The vigil happened because of so many reasons,"" Coriano said. ""Not only to honor the victims, not only to bring forward a bigger conversation about solidarity against all forms of racism, but to validate the long history of pain and hurt this beautiful community has experienced.""

Rampant racial discrimination on social media threatens Asian Americans since COVID-19,None,Others,2021-04-14,"The StopAsianHate campaign triggered by the 2021 Atlanta Spa shooting finally drew public attention toward racial discrimination against Asian Americans, the so-called ""silent group"" always suffering from racism both in-person and online. 
Social media has exposed long-standing antagonism amid a China-bashing campaign in the US which has constantly stoked xenophobia that risks the lives of millions of Asian Americans since the former US President Donald Trump's COVID-19 blame game started. 
75 percent of Asian American adults are among 288 individuals who experienced online harassment themselves said it was due to their race and ethnicity, according to a Morning Consult poll conducted from March 24 to 30 toward 1,000 Asian adults living in the US, which was released on Thursday. Data shows a surge in online harassment and racist posts targeting Asians following a prevalence of racially insensitive hashtags on social media. 
In an era of globalized information explosion, social networking platforms have become a tool for many opportunists, who in order to gain profit, publish sensationalist statements and disinformation that attract attention and influence public opinion to portray a negative image of particular groups of people, which ultimately has serious social consequences. 
Benjamin H. Nam, a Korean American scholar in international and comparative education who also conducted research on racial trauma amid the COVID-19 pandemic, found that since the early days of the pandemic - between February and April 2020 - YouTube has ""portrayed countless accounts of racial discrimination toward Asians, Asian Americans, and international Asian students,"" while discriminative contents surged ""especially during the presidential election campaign period,"" Nam told the Global Times. 
Some opinion leaders, especially the influential US politicians who constantly make racist remarks on their personal accounts with tens of thousands of followers, have largely fueled the spread of hate against Asians on social media, observers found. 
""I clearly remember a white American man tweeted in February that he planned to shoot Chinese-Americans indiscriminately in Brooklyn's Chinatown because 'the Chinese had brought the virus to the US',"" Tang Enyang, 46, who has been naturalized in the US for 20 years and a New York resident told the Global Times. 
Tang also added that although this incident ended with the New York City Police Department deploying extra police patrols on local streets, in the comments section of the tweet, there was a 50-50 split between condemnation and fanaticism, with indifference seeming to slightly overwhelm concem. 
In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, attacks against Asians, especially those of Chinese descent, on social networking platforms have made Asian Americans feel isolated and grossly misunderstood. 
39-year-old Muong (pseudonym) from Vietnam, who has been living in the US since the age 13 and took on American citizenship at the age of 19, believes there was an obvious surge in discriminative posts on social media in the beginning when the former president Donald Trump dubbed COVID-19 as the ""China virus."" 
She thinks Trump's comments and negative nomenclature affected people's projection of China and Asia. ""That was very annoying and stupid,"" Muong told the Global Times on Tuesday. 
Tang also noted that the growing discrimination against Asians in the US has been significantly linked to the fact that Trump and his subordinates have deliberately referred to the novel coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" in several important public appearances. 
""Many white Americans seem to have found an outlet for their unbridled anger against Asians, and there are many extreme-minded opinion leaders who have gone to great lengths to reinforce this message, leading to countless people taking to Twitter to 'declare war' on the Asians,"" she said. 
A report released by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a civil rights group, examined Twitter activity surrounding Trump's declaration on October 2, 2020. Researchers found an 85 percent increase in anti-Asian rhetoric and conspiracy theories on the platform in the 12 hours following the announcement, many blaming China, the US media NBC reported. 
Tang noted that whether on Facebook or Twitter, the only things that inspire compassion for Asians from the majority of Americans are extremely violent incidents, such as attacks that result in bloodshed or the loss of life of people of Chinese descent, with hard evidence on video or audio, but otherwise, verbal attacks that make the said group of people feel uncomfortable were largely unnoticed. 
""But there are so many voices conveying racist messages. Twitter and Facebook occasionally blocked or flagged these messages, but for the most part turned a blind eye, and as to whether or not to ban and punish these foul-mouthed people, no one but Asians are concerned,"" Tang said. 
Social media's response to identify remarks within the racist category follows inconsistent and unclear matrices. Though almost all platforms have rules against racist posts or the use of sensitive terms, the line was still not clear, or they sometimes flip-flopped about the red lines. While TikTok has banned ""Kung Flu"" in their platforms, posts containing the word can still be found on Facebook and Youtube. 
The platforms sometimes also found it difficult or hesitated in balancing controlling hate speech and protecting freedom of expression, especially when facing pressure from political figures accusing the platforms of censorship. 
According to the Morning Consult poll, a 43 percent plurality say social media companies are doing a ""poor"" job of preventing the spread of hate speech and violent content targeting Asian people on their respective platforms 
Muong agrees that social media platforms did do a poor job. She doesn't find social media platforms punish the accounts that spread hateful information against Asians. 
""During the presidential election, they did close Trump's social media account. I am not aware if they closed any of the Asian haters' accounts,"" she said. 
""Because it is very politically related and I don't think the profit-driven tech companies have the drive or motivation to close the accounts,"" she stressed. 
Hatred never gone 
More than a year after the novel coronavirus, Asian Americans still struggled with hatred flooding various social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter. 
Nam pointed to some American politicians directly mentioning racial issues in public, and both traditional and social media consistently delivered their messages. 
Former president Donald Trump used racist rhetoric, claiming [the] coronavirus is originated from Wuhan of China, and calling coronavirus [the] Wuhan or Chinese virus. Senator Blackburn of Tennessee State also tweeted [about] the Sinophobia issues by using some uncomfortable texts, Nam said. 
In October 2020, a US marine, Jarrett Morford, used racial slurs against Chinese people and threatened to shoot them in a viral video tweet, and said ""China is going to pay for what they have done to this country and the world."" The video is still trackable on Twitter now. 
In another video recorded in July 2020, a tech industry CEO was caught on camera yelling racist slurs against and taunting an Asian American family at a birthday celebration in a restaurant. After public anger surged after the video gained over 1 million views on Instagram, he was forced to apologize and resign from his post. 
Spurred on by some US politicians, onslaught, hate crimes, and anti-Chinese discourse have become more common across social media. 
The Global Times found some hateful remarks against Asians, or comments that contain undertones of prejudice or stereotypes on Twitter. They attack the Chinese government and people under the guise of ""protecting the human rights"" of other ethnicities. 
The ADL released a survey last month that showed ""severe"" harassment such as ""stalking, physical threats, swatting, doxing or sustained harassment"" has been on the rise for Asian Americans. About 17 percent of Asian Americans said in January they experienced severe online harassment compared with 11 percent during the same period in 2020, the largest uptick compared with other groups. About half said they were harassed because of their race, US media CNET reported. 
There have been ongoing debates regarding the idea that accounts spreading discrimination and hate against Asians should be banned on social media, Nam said. ""I feel definitely uncomfortable with the discrimination toward Asian people, but I have no clue how the social media policy can be reformed."" 
Nam believes that the US and its people are also affected by the widespread of anti-Asian disinformation on social media, because the trend hurts the country's own image in the international community. 
""When social media contributes to developing racial discrimination in this specific time of a global health crisis, a lot of individuals may have cultivated the sense of anti- American sentiments in the contemporary global society.""

Are America's schools safe for Asian Americans? ,"Cheah, Charissa S L; Aggie Yellow Horse; Gee, Kevin A",Others,2021-04-19										,"The rise in anti-Asian hate crimes during the pandemic has prompted many Asian American parents to enroll their children in remote learning out of concern for their child's safety at school. Asian American youths are enrolled in remote learning at much higher rates than other racial groups. Federal data show that 78% of Asian American eighth graders attended school virtually in February 2021, whereas just 59% of Black, 59% of Latino and 29% of white students attended school virtually. 
Here, three scholars address school safety for Asian American students. 
Are American schools dangerous for Asian American students? 
Aggie J. Yellow Horse, assistant professor of Asian Pacific American Studies at Arizona State University. 
Data show that many Asian American youths have experienced anti-Asian violence in the past year. 
Asian Americans have experienced a great deal of racial harassment amid the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent survey found that 1 in 8 Asian Americans reported experiencing anti-Asian hate incidents in 2020. The victims of that harassment aren't just adults - they include students. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 3,800 hate incidents targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have been reported to the Stop AAPI Hate National Reporting Center. Among the incidents early in the pandemic, 16% percent of the targets were Asian American youths ages 12-20. 
The majority of the young victims, about 80%, reported being bullied or verbally harassed. In over half the incidents, the perpetrator used anti-Asian hate rhetoric. About 1 in 5 hate incidents happened at school. 
National trends before the pandemic suggested that Asian American students were already more likely to experience racial discrimination, such as race-related name- calling, from their peers at school than other categories of students. About 11% of Asian American students reported being called hate-related words, compared with 6.3% of white students in 2015. A separate study found that bullying and physical violence were less of an issue for Asian American students. Only about 7.3% reported being bullied at school in 2017, compared with 23% of white students. 
How common race-based harassment against Asian students is can vary based on different factors, such as where students live, their gender, grades or immigration status. For example, a study from California found that Asian American sixth graders in California reported being bullied and victimized at higher rates than other racial 
groups. 
What are the biggest worries for Asian American youth and parents?

Many Asian American parents are worried that their children will be the victims of discrimination once school reopens.

In one survey, nearly 1 in 2 Chinese American parents and 1 in 2 Chinese American youth reported being directly targeted with COVID-19 racial discrimination in person or online. About 4 in 5 of these parents and their children also reported witnessing racism directed at someone else of their own race either online or in person. 
Despite their concerns, some parents may avoid talking to their children about anti-Asian racism to avoid scaring them while they are at school. Even if parents want to have the ""race talk"" with their children, many struggle with how to talk to their children about the potential racism they might encounter. Some parents may not have been taught these lessons while growing up and are grappling with how to make sense of these experiences. 
Anti-Asian racism is also associated with greater depressive symptoms and anxiety in Chinese American parents and their children. A majority of Americans blame China for its mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak. Researchers have found that even thinking that one's racial or ethnic group is viewed by the general public as a threat to the health of Americans is linked to poorer mental health in both Chinese American parents and youths. 
Asian Americans are less likely than non-Hispanic white Americans to seek mental health help. This is due in part to perceived stigma, language barriers and lack of mental health providers of the same ethnicity. These disparities are even greater for Asian American families with fewer financial resources. 
Some Asian American parents have also expressed concerns about the ability of schools to maintain appropriate COVID-19-related health and safety measures. They are worried about the health risks that children exposed to others at school might bring home. Asians Americans are more likely to live in a multigenerational household, in which older adults might be at a higher health risk. 
Even if parents choose to keep their children home because of one or several of these concerns, they are getting the message that in-person education is superior to virtual education. Being out of physical school could cause Asian Americans to miss out on these opportunities and resources even more. Also, due to the ""model minority myth,"" which characterizes Asian Americans as successful, the needs of this very diverse group, including a large number of immigrant and refugee Asian families in the U.S., are often overlooked. With 30% of Asian Americans reporting limited English proficiency, these families are more difficult to reach. The fears of being harassed also make some parents reluctant to access educational materials or free meals or even reach out to teachers or counselors for help. 
What can schools do to reduce threats to Asian American students? 
Kevin Gee, an associate professor in the school of education at the University of California Davis 
Helping students build strong and supportive relationships with each other can reduce their physical victimization and buffer the negative effects of discrimination Asian Americans face. 
Schools can also create supportive environments by implementing a range of evidence-based approaches, such as building teachers' cultural knowledge and strengthening teacher-student relationships. Activities like engaging students in class discussions about bullying have been shown to reduce bullying. 
Alongside initiatives to build supportive environments, schools should also consider partnering with parents. Directly engaging Asian American parents in anti-bullying initiatives can help reduce victimization. For example, schools can collaborate with parents to craft disciplinary policies on bullying. Schools can also hold workshops to teach parents how to handle and prevent bullying. 
In order to reduce threats and eradicate harm, I believe schools will need to consider whether they are doing enough to protect Asian American youth. One landmark case underscores this. In the aftermath of violent attacks on Asian American students at South Philadelphia High School in 2009, a Department of Justice investigation revealed that the school district was ""deliberately indifferent"" to harassment against Asian students that fueled the attacks. 
A key takeaway: Harms against Asian American students can be systemic and require broader structural solutions. When South Philadelphia High School began to do more to promote multicultural awareness and improved systems to report and investigate harassment, the school saw fewer violent incidents. 
To make Asian American youth feel safe and protected, schools need to track, report and respond to incidents of hate against Asian Americans, especially among Asian American ethnic subgroups. Subgroup data, often lacking on Asian Americans, can be a powerful tool in revealing potential disparities and highlighting groups that schools need to target for support. 
I believe schools also need to invest in longer-term systemic changes such as including a more complete history of Asian Americans in U.S. social studies curricula.

New York Charges Man in Three Anti-Asian Attacks; NYPD officials say Joseph Russo allegedly pushed a 64-year-old woman in one incident,"Chapman, Ben",Others,2021-04-08			,"A Brooklyn man was awaiting arraignment on hate-crime charges in three separate anti-Asian attacks in the past month, law-enforcement officials said Thursday. 
Joseph Russo, 27 years old, was arrested Wednesday in the three incidents, including one on March 5 when he allegedly pushed a 64-year-old Asian-American woman to the ground in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn, New York Police Department officials said. 
Mr. Russo is also accused of pulling the hair of a 32-year-old Asian woman on March 22 outside a building in the Homecrest section of the borough, according to the officials. He also allegedly pushed a 77-year-old Asian man to the ground on April 5 while the man was buying groceries in the Sheepshead Bay section of the borough, the officials said. 
Violence Against Asian-Americans 
Video surveillance shows Mr. Russo committing the March 22 and April 5 attacks, according to the officials. Minor injuries were reported in the incidents, the officials said. 
Mr. Russo was awaiting arraignment in criminal court in Brooklyn on Thursday. He was charged with crimes including assault as a hate crime and aggravated harassment as a hate crime, the officials said. 
An attorney for Mr. Russo couldn't be reached for comment. 
The alleged attacks come amid a rise in complaints of hate crimes against Asian Americans in New York City and other U.S. cities. 
Asians were targeted in 39 New York City hate crimes from Jan. 1 through April 4 of this year, up from 11 in the same period in 2020, according to the NYPD. The NYPD recorded 28 hate crimes against Asians for 2020, up from three in 2019. 
Phil Wong, president of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance of Greater New York, a nonprofit volunteer group, said in an interview Thursday that bias attacks on Asian-Americans and other groups occur regularly in the city. ""All New York City residents are entitled to feel safe while walking in the streets,"" Mr. Wong said. ""Because of all these attacks, not just Asians, but, I think, everyone feels unsafe."" 
Some of the alleged hate crimes against Asian-Americans in New York City have been motivated by the false belief that Asians are responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic, according to NYPD officials. The NYPD has responded to the crimes by increasing efforts to investigate and prevent bias incidents. 
Last year, the NYPD created an Asian hate crime task force, staffed by detectives of Asian descent, to investigate the crimes. The NYPD recently added resources to combat the incidents, including the use of undercover officers, as more crimes were reported this year. One such undercover officer on Tuesday arrested a woman who began harassing Asian people at a salon in Manhattan, according to police officials. ",2737
Stop hatred aimed at AAPI community,None,Others,2021-04-04,"We created Stop AAPI Hate so there was a way to capture the increasing attacks on our community. One year later,the vaccine provides a light at the end of the tunnel for the pandemic. But it seems there's no end in sight for anti-
Asian hate.News about the deadly shooting in Atlanta broke almost one year to the day since we created the Stop AAPI Hate
reporting center.
Twelve months ago, our country was in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most Americans were entering
their first quarantines and watching a virus spread faster than government systems could track.
But Asian Americans were watching something spread even faster than COVID-19: Widespread hate and
discrimination against members of our community.
In early February, even before a single COVID-19 case was recorded in Los Angeles, a 12-year-old Asian American
child in the city was physically assaulted in his school by a classmate who said he was a coronavirus carrier and
that he should go back to China.
At the time, incidents like these weren't broadly reported. But they were widespread —they were happening to our
neighbors, colleagues, our family members and ourselves.
We created Stop AAPI Hate so there was a way to capture the increasing attacks on our community.
One year later, the vaccine provides a light at the end of the tunnel for the pandemic. But it seems there's no end in
sight for anti-Asian hate.
In the two weeks since our country watched in horror as eight people —six of them Asian American women –were
killed in Atlanta, we've been repeatedly asked why this is occurring. Many Asian Americans do not view these
shootings in a vacuum.
In the days leading up to the shooting, there were what seemed to be daily reports of violent, public attacks against
Asian Americans —especially elderly Asian Americans —in places that included Oakland, San Francisco and New
York City.
The Atlanta shootings took place, in fact, hours after we published a report documenting nearly 3,800 self-reported
hate incidents from the AAPI community.
Anti-Asian hate and the scapegoating of immigrants is nothing new. But in looking through the thousands of
reports that we received, several things came to the fore.
Trump's rhetoric normalized hate
For one, former President Donald Trump's and other government officials' widespread use of slurs like ""Kung Flu,""
his anti-China rhetoric and his exploitation of existing xenophobia played a major factor in normalizing and
spreading hate against Asian Americans, both during the Trump administration and even now that his term is over.
Asian Americans reported hearing these slurs like ""China virus"" thrown at them while they were refused business,
harassed, spit on or attacked.
There was also a devastating intersection between racism and misogyny. In our data, women reported incidents
2.3 times more often than men did. The reports and stories from these women often described being sexually
harassed and COVID-19 being weaponized as part of the sexual harassment.
""You Asian c---,"" one man yelled at Vietnamese American Hong Lee after she declined his offer of lunch last
August. ""What is the matter with these hoes ... Help her go back to f----- Asia.""
This month, we've also been asked about what can be done. In the shadow of the Atlanta-area shooting, there is,
understandably, a strong urge to focus on hate crime enforcement.
For example, the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, authored by U.S. Sen. Mazie Hirono and U.S. Rep. Grace Meng, would
require a Department of Justice employee to facilitate fast reviews of federal, state and local COVID-19 hate crimes
for one year as well as mandate guidance to local enforcement to establish an online hate crime reporting form in
multiple languages.
Certainly, steps such as these can help address the lack of hate crime reporting. But the fact remains that 90% of
the incidents reported to us are not hate crimes because no underlying crime was committed. Many are civil rights
violations involving discrimination in the workplace, restaurants and retail venues and can be prosecuted in civil
court.
Multiple solutions are needed
Racism against Asian Americans is longstanding and complex, and requires a comprehensive and multi-faceted
approach.
We need resources dedicated to local communities, including community safety programs and in-language
support for those in need of mental health, legal and immigration services.
We need to build a strong civil rights infrastructure at the local level by fully funding community-based groups,
which are often the first responders to incidents of hate.
We need to increase exposure to the voices and histories of all communities by expanding ethnic studies and
education.
And finally, we need stronger federal civil rights laws that address discrimination in public accommodations
—businesses where we buy our groceries, refill our prescriptions and eat our meals.
These solutions are neither complex nor out-of-reach.
A number of groups across the country are already moving this work forward. In Los Angeles, LA vs. Hate provides
direct assistance to victims of hate through a 211 reporting system for all marginalized community members.
The San Francisco-based Coalition for Community Safety and Justice focuses on victim services, intervention and
prevention programs, community mediation and restorative justice practices.
We founded Stop AAPI Hate to not only raise awareness about anti-Asian hate but also to fight against it.
The outpouring of support and solidarity from all racial groups that has risen up in the days since this tragedy
gives us every reason to be optimistic. With the energy and calls for change we are seeing now, we are
fundamentally hopeful that there is a true path forward in ending anti-Asian hate.

Asians turn to gun shops as attacks rise,Liu Yinmeng,Others,2021-04-19,"With no letup in racist violence in US, fears drive many to resort to self-defense 
More Asian Americans are arming themselves for protection amid a surge in violence and abuse directed at them during the coronavirus pandemic. 
Tim Hensley, general manager of Towers Armory, a gun shop in Toledo, Ohio, told China Daily that the number of Asian customers who have come to his store recently has jumped from ""a couple of people a week"" to ""four or five a day"". 
Most of them are first-time gun owners who feel the need to take matters into their own hands to fight for their security, Hensley said from his shop in the industrial suburb of Oregon. 
""I think people have just now realized that they can buy a gun,"" he said. ""While it wasn't a big priority before all this, now it's becoming: How do I become more self- sufficient and be responsible for my own security and less dependent on public services? So guns become a much cleaner option for you at that point."" 
The National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry group, estimates that more than 8.4 million people bought a firearm for the first time last year, and 21 million background checks were conducted for guns sale during the year. 
According to the foundation, Asian men accounted for 3.1 percent of all customers at gun retailers during the first half of 2020; Asian women made up 0.7 percent. The group notes that Asians make up 5.7 percent of the nation's population. 
In comparison, 55.8 percent of the gun buyers in 2020 were white men and 16.6 percent were white women. 
But many firearm merchants painted a slightly different picture. 
Hensley said the number of Asian American gun-buyers began growing shortly after the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States, and a further rise followed a mass shooting in the Atlanta area of Georgia in which most of the victims were of Asian background. 
More Asian Americans, as well as women in general, are also taking Concealed Carry Weapon Training, or CCW, a firearms safety or training class required for a gun owner to obtain a permit to carry a concealed weapon in public areas. 
""It's basically everybody (taking the CCW classes), but there is more Asians participating now,"" Hensley said. He reported a five-fold jump in the number of students at the store's CCW classes, more than half women. 
Anti-Chinese slurs 
Racially motivated violence and hate incidents against Asian Americans have been on the rise since the pandemic started last year. Some blame former US president Donald Trump, who during his presidency made repeated mentions of terms such as ""China virus"" and ""kung flu"".Others have pointed to the effects of poverty among people and broader financial struggles exacerbated by the pandemic as causes. 
On March 16, a shooting rampage in three Atlanta spas that left eight people, including six women of Asian descent, dead. The attack sowed fresh fear in a community already reeling from a year of heightened anti-Asian attacks. This racially motivated violence has triggered many protests across the US. 
""This is a change for Asian people (to buy guns). Asian Americans are going through a crisis time because of coronavirus and Trump saying the 'China virus' stuff and all of that,"" said Jay Zeng, owner of Jimmy's Sport Shop, a gun store in Mineola in New York's Long Island. 
Zeng claims his shop is the first Asian-owned gun store in Long Island. He attributes the recent rise in gun sales to a fear of violence. 
""Most Asian people are buying guns because they're scared,"" Zeng said. ""Ammunition is selling 10 times more than usual in the country in general."" 
Charles Hu, a retired police officer and general manager of Manhattan's John Jovino Gun Shop, said March ""was the best-selling month for guns in the US"". 
""We have a lot of people from the Chinese community come to inquire about the gun license service,"" said Hu, a Chinese immigrant who has worked at the gun shop in New York's Little Italy neighborhood since 1990.The 110-year-old business shuttered last year due to the pandemic. 
Darren Leung, owner of West Side Rifle & Pistol Range in Manhattan, said more Asian women are participating in shooting practice. 
""We have seen a lot more Asian clients coming to practice shooting, just to be able to say that 'I'm able to protect myself,"" he said. 
In the three-hour window since he opened his doors for business, Javier Garcia, co-owner of HTX Tactical, had ushered in four to five older Asian customers. 
The Houston-based firearm retailer said his store has long catered to a clientele of young Asians who purchase guns for competition, protection or recreation. 
When the pandemic broke out there was a sharp rise in gun sales by every race, with everyone scrambling to buy guns thinking ""it was the end of the world"", he said, but the most recent Atlanta shooting has put older Asian on edge. 
""It's a little bit of both, whether it's a hate crime or just being scared in general, and they just don't want anything to happen to them or their families, so they just want to be prepared,"" he said when asked about the causes behind the spike in gun sales among older Asians. 
Disproportionate surge 
According to an analysis of police statistics by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, anti-Asian hate crimes in 2020 rose 145 percent across major US cities, while overall hate crimes fell 6 percent. 
The New York City Police Department reported three hate crimes against Asians in 2019 and 28 in 2020, an 833 percent hike. Los Angeles and San Francisco both saw an increase, from seven to 15, and six to nine, respectively. 
The advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate said there were 3,795 hate incidents from March 19, 2020 to Feb 28,2021. A disproportionate higher number of these attacks were directed at women. The group stands up for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. 
Chinese made up 42.2 percent of those who reported experiencing hate. They were followed by Koreans with 14.8 percent, Vietnamese 8.5 percent, and Filipinos 7.9 percent. 
Anti-Asian incidents occurred in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. California topped the list with 1,691 cases. New York trailed with 517 cases. It was followed by the state of Washington, 158 cases, and Texas with 103 incidents. Ohio had 40 cases. The nonprofit doesn't report its data to the police. 
David Liu, owner of Arcadia Firearm and Safety in Los Angeles, said people of all races and ethnic backgrounds are snapping up guns, causing supplies to be seriously depleted at his store, which is in a mainly Asian American area around 20 kilometers northeast of downtown Los Angeles. He is even having trouble getting products from his major suppliers, he said. 
""Nobody could get their hands on a gun nowadays. Gun stores across the US are all running out of merchandise."" 
David Stone, of Dong's Guns, Ammo and Reloading, a gun shop in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said sales in his store have surged 400 percent since the start of the pandemic. 
An Atlanta gun-shop owner, who didn't give his name, said there's been a ""significant increase"" in sales since last year, driven by people's desire for self-defense. He didn't notice any change in the number of Asian customers after the spa shootings. 
""The focus on Asians, no, it's not. They've been buying from last year also.""

The new Asian American civil rights movement in NJ speaks up,"Chao, Mary ",Others,2021-04-08,"Angry. Hurt. Shocked. 
Those are some of the emotions that have racked Asian Americans in North Jersey after witnessing unprovoked race-based attacks as Asians have been scapegoated for the COVID-19 pandemic that originated in Wuhan, China. 
But Asian Americans are harnessing that emotion and using it to fuel a mass movement designed to stem the tide of hate against Asians. In cities across the United States in recent weeks, tens of thousands of people took to the streets to demonstrate. 
More than 150 years after Asians first settled in America, Asian Americans are for the first time mobilizing en masse in a civil rights movement. The recent attacks have prompted many to speak out for the first time, shedding cultural norms. 
North Jersey is home to some of the largest Asian American communities in the United States. More than 40% of residents in boroughs such as Fort Lee and Leonia identify as Asian, as do nearly 60% of residents in Palisades Park. In recent weeks they took to the streets carrying posters and signs that read ""Stop Asian Hate"" and ""Hate is a Virus."" 
A new generation of North Jersey Asian Americans is spearheading this movement, having grown up in the Garden State feeling isolated. These people have faced racism, but until now brushed it off instead of calling it out. 
Below, some of these new leaders share their stories. 
Brian Jon 
Brian Jon could not believe what he heard. 
As a freshman at Bergen County Technical Schools in 2017, he learned of an incident at a sister school, Bergen County Academies, in which a Spanish language teacher allegedly announced during class that she hated Korean students. Outraged, he started a petition drive and gathered more than 1,500 signatures to successfully oust the teacher from the school. 
That experience led Jon to further activism. An immigrant who arrived from South Korea at the age of 6 with his mother Ellen Jeon, life has not been easy for the 19-year- old. 
""The only thing I knew how to say was hello,"" Jon recalled of his arrival in New Jersey. 
He attended schools in Tenafly, raised by his busy single mom. Before long, other kids introduced him to sports such as wrestling, football and swimming. 
Though he assimilated, Jon remains very aware of his Korean American identity. 
""It is our job to be aware of anti-Asian bias,"" Jon said. ""Our parents' generation, Asians are often taught to be very mannered, to be respectful of our elders so we don't really raise our voices and we normally keep ourselves very shut. We suppress our feelings."" 
In January 2020, Jon launched an organization for like-minded young Asian activists called Asian American Youth Council. There are over 50 student members of the organization advocating for Asian American issues. 
""It's very crucial for us second generation Asian Americans speak up for our elders,"" he said, noting the spate of hate crimes. ""It is a mandatory thing now."" 
Cecilla Chan and Mia Hur 
Watching news reports about the Atlanta massage spa shootings, Cecilia Chan of Tenafly couldn't sleep. She was convinced it was a case of Asian fetishization, where men fantasize about Asian women in a deviant nature. 
""I was outraged when media tried to spin the narrative of sexual addiction,"" said Chan, who has been victimized by Asian fetishization stereotypes. ""I was completely outraged. It just hit home on so many levels."" 
Meanwhile, Tenafly resident Mia Hur, a Realtor, purse designer and mother of a teenage son, was also upset about the shootings and that the suspected gunmen was normalized in the media by explaining he had a sexual addiction. She knew she needed to do something. 
Simultaneously, Chan and Hur reached out to elected officials, who asked them to organize. In three days, the duo put together a rally calling for an end to anti-Asian 
hate. 
""I felt hurt. I felt outraged. I felt angry,"" Chan said. 
Hur echoed Chan's sentiments, explaining the current mood of many Asian Americans. 
""A lot of people probably don't understand why it's a big deal to the Asian American community,"" Hur said of the Atlanta shootings. ""It just perpetuates stereotypes, gaslighting our culture."" 
Chan and Hur connected over shared experiences and emotions, organizing the first anti-Asian racism rally in North Jersey after the Atlanta killings. It was held in Tenafly on March 21 and drew more than 800 people. More than a half dozen vigils followed throughout North Jersey. 
The recent spate of attacks against Asian Americans is opening old wounds for Chan and Hur. The nonprofit group Stop AAPI Hate reported 3,795 anti-Asian incidents since the start of the COVID pandemic, with Asians scapegoated for the coronavirus. 
Now 47, Hur arrived in the United States from South Korea when she was 6. Back then, hers was among a handful of Asian families in Tenafly. 
""It was isolating,"" Hur recalled. ""That really made me aware of my identity."" 
Her parents were busy working as merchants in New York City, so she had to grow up fast. The community of Tenafly was kind and generous to her in her youth, with families inviting her to places and events. Because of its diversity, she and her husband chose to stay in Tenafly to raise their son, now 13. 
Born in New York City to Chinese immigrant parents who owned Chinese restaurants, Chan, 44, describes herself as a recovering lawyer who is now a stay-at-home mom to two children. Her family lived in Westchester County, New York before moving to Cresskill, where she sometimes felt boxed in. 
Chan and Hur both understand the Asian immigrant experience and that language and culture have been barriers to attaining visibility. 
""We're taught to work hard, keep our heads down, don't make trouble. These are cultural foundations,"" Hur said. ""We wrestle with it. I know our whole community wrestles with it."" 
So Chan is working on helping others in the community speak out. ""There's so much hesitation due to cultural norms,"" she said. 
A goal of the movement is to unify Asian Americans throughout New Jersey and celebrate diversity within diversity. 
""We are made up of different cultures and races from around the world,"" Chan said. ""That's what makes us stronger.""

Growing up in a Korean immigrant household in Tenafly, assimilation was difficult for Chris Chung. He arrived in the United States at the age of 11 in 1978 and was among the few immigrant children in his school. While other classmates' parents attended school events and cheered for their children, Chung's parents were busy working at the family business, a general merchandise store in Brooklyn, and later a wholesale fine jewelry business. 
""I envied other children's parents attending events, from sporting events to school events,"" said Chung, 53. ""That always stuck with me."" As a result, he always thought that when he grew up and had children, he would make sure he was part of their education.

As an adult living in Palisades Park and wanting his children to enjoy a life he did not have Chung, a real estate agent, decided to get involved in local politics. Initially he ran for school board and then a borough council seat before being elected mayor in a contentious race against incumbent James Rotundo in 2018. An online tirade by Rotundo's mother against the town's large Korean community went viral. 
Lorraine Rotundo posted on Facebook shortly after her son learned that the Democratic primary race in June of 2018 was too dose to call. 
""Go to hell PALISADES PARK, let the GD KOREANS have this F'n town,"" she wrote. ""All of us AMERICANS are so done. I am going to suggest that only English be spoken in our Boro Hall at least while an AMERICAN is still the mayor."" 
Rotundo apologized for her post. More than 300 Korean Americans took to the streets to protest. 
Now in his third year as mayor, Chung reflects on his role as leader of a community that is almost 60% Asian. 
""My whole purpose is to serve the community,"" Chung said. ""I'm not title-hungry."" 
Since taking office, Chung has implemented changes such as hiring Korean speaking staff to serve residents and translating the borough's website into Korean and Spanish. 
Having been a victim of racist bullying in New Jersey, Chung is glad to see anti-Asian racism being addressed publicly and nationally. 
""I had many encounters being bullied — workplace conflicts,"" Chung said. I've seen many situations where Asians are viewed as non-aggressive. A lot of people have this perception that hey, we can pick on them. He probably won't retaliate back."" 
With the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes since the pandemic began, Chung takes time to speak to Asian constituents about the fear of being attacked. 
""Sometimes they feel so isolated, even though they were born and raised here,"" Chung said. 
Culturally, Asians avoid conflict and avoid speaking out, Chung said. But it's time to change the old ways, he said. 
""More Asians need to get involved in politics and community,"" he said. ""You are an American, just like everyone else. That's what I tell my children."" ",9034
Politicization of virus fuels rise in hate crimes,None,Others,2021-04-02,"The mass protests staged across the United States and many parts of the world in support of Asian Americans' fight against the widespread and rising racial discrimination against them should drive home the message that the world's self-proclaimed champion of human rights should stop pointing fingers at others and seek remedies for its own woes. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more Asian Americans have become the target of discrimination and abuse thanks to the ""China virus"" spite spouted by US politicians and media. 
To gloss over the country's incompetence in fighting the pandemic and shift the blame, some irresponsible US politicians and media have adopted racist rhetoric and stoked anti-Chinese sentiments, fueling hate crimes targeting Asian Americans. 
According to a survey released on Wednesday by the Anti-Defamation League, an anti-hate organization headquartered in New York, some 17 percent of Asian Americans have experienced verbal harassment and physical threats, up from 11 percent a year ago. 
Stop AAPI Hate, a California-based nonprofit social organization tracking incidents of violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, said it had received nearly 3,800 reports of abuse or attacks against people of Asian descent between March 2020 and February 2021. 
The rise in the number of hate crimes against Asian Americans has ignited nationwide anger and calls for immediate action by the US government. 
Responding to the growing outrage, President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced steps to protect Asian Americans against discrimination and violent attacks, which include establishing a Justice Department initiative to track reports of anti-Asian hate crimes and expand its outreach to community organizations. The announcement comes two weeks after eight people, including six women of Asian descent, were shot and killed in Atlanta. 
Asian Americans, of course, are not the only group subject to racial discrimination and social injustice as the US, touted as the beacon of human rights, has a long history of discrimination against African Americans and other disadvantaged groups. 
The trial of police officer Derek Chauvin charged with the murder of African American George Floyd last year, which sparked the Black Lives Matter movement, began on Monday. 
True, when political, economic and social problems arise, ethnic minorities tend to be made a scapegoat. The Anti-Defamation League found the distribution of white supremacist propaganda in the US increased nearly twofold in 2020 from the year before. 
But the racial discrimination in the US is obviously not just a symptom of distress during the pandemic, it has deep roots. As such, people around the world cannot help but ask why the US should feel it is in a position to lecture other countries on human rights. 
It is high time the US fulfilled its own obligations to protect the rights of US citizens whatever their ethnicity and address the social injustices at home.",2980
First Person: Anti-Asian Racism Can Feel Like Death by a Thousand Cuts,Anna,Others,2021-04-26,"From Unsplash by Fernando Aguila“Wow, you speak English so good,” called out the man, sitting casually on the ground in front of a DC Metro station. 
""What?"" I blurted out in surprise. He had interrupted my conversation with my girlfriends as we were walking into the station. After I turned to look at him, he asked, ""Hey, can you spare any change?"" 
Immediately, I could feel the anger rising up in me as a wave of heat. After a long summer of being harassed by more than a dozen men for being a young Asian American woman who dared to take public transit, eat at restaurants, or walk down the street, I had had enough. I exploded at him. 
It's been about 25 years, so I can't recall the exact words I used. I know I raised my voice. I know I told him that I was born here, in the United States, and that my English was better than his. I undoubtedly told him to go f- off before I angrily stomped away to catch the Metro. My friends were caught off guard by my reaction and I remember their surprised faces. Perhaps the man sincerely thought he was offering me a compliment. But by that point of the summer, I was DONE with racist (and often sexualized) street harassment. 
I had not lived outside of California, and in particular, outside of major metro areas like the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles (with highly visible communities of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders), since I was a toddler. So when I moved to Washington, DC at 19 to pursue a policy internship for the summer before my junior year at UCLA, I was not prepared to be an oddity. 
When my fellow UCLA roommates, also women of Asian descent, and I rode the Metro, went to restaurants, or simply walked down the street on our way to the July 4th celebration on the Mall, we were repeatedly harassed on the basis of both our race and gender identity. And this wasn't limited to inside the Beltway. We experienced harassment on weekend trips to New York City and Boston, too. 
Some of what we experienced falls under the definition of microaggressions, which Dr. Derald Wing Sue, a professor of counseling psychology at Columbia University, defines as the ""everyday slights, indignities, put-downs and insults that members of marginalized groups experience in their day-to-day interactions with individuals who are often unaware that they have engaged in an offensive or demeaning way."" But many of the incidents were intentional acts of racist and sexist behavior. 
We never reported any of the harassment to the police, nor should we have since I don't think any of the offensive conduct would be legally considered a crime. Yet just because such offensive speech is legal doesn't mean it isn't cause for concern. Hate speech can lead to physical attacks. Thankfully, my friends and I were never spit on, punched, pushed to the ground, or physically assaulted (unlike other Asian American and Pacific Islanders who have been over the past year, as documented in the Stop AAPI Hate report). 
The summer I moved to Washington, DC, I was overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of aggressive and degrading verbal assaults, as men leaned out of car windows, approached us on the street, or came up to us in crowded restaurants. 
These men would crow, ""I've never f - ed a Chinese girl, I wonder what it's like!"" or leer in our faces, shouting, ""Ching Chong, Ching Chong!"" 
I can't quite recall all the insults hurled in our faces, but I wouldn't be surprised if some of the men yelled out, ""Me so horny!"" or ""Me love you long time!"" This was the 90s after all, and 2 Live Crew and Sir Mix-a-lot's hit songs were still fresh in many minds. 
There usually wasn't enough time to say anything in response other than ""F you!"" when drivers called out their insults, as they drove by too quickly. But the few times someone walked up to us and made these comments, I recall being too surprised and scared to say anything. Usually, walking away was my first response. 
On a less aggressive note, there were also the repeated questions asking us where we were from. ""California!"" was never sufficient. People kept trying to figure out ""what"" we were. I started to brace myself for the question every time we got into a taxi, as the male driver would inevitably ask and then follow up with, ""No, really, WHERE are you from?"" 
If I tried to reply, ""Well, I was born in New York City,"" then the questioner would inevitably ask, ""Well, where are your PARENTS from?"" Sigh. I would have to reluctantly admit that my immigrant parents are from Taiwan. If I felt like the questioner was genuinely interested or would recognize the difference, I would add that their families were refugees from China who fled to Taiwan after the Communists took over. 
Sometimes, the comments were more innocent observations about our novelty. One Friday night, we went to TGI Friday's for dinner and dared to talk in boisterous voices, laughing as we enjoyed our meal. We were not noticeably louder than any other group of four young people hanging out with friends after a long week of work. 
Nonetheless, our waiter was stunned. He literally said to us, ""Wow, you're not like the Asians around here. You don't walk around staring at the ground."" He then called over other waiters from the rest of the restaurant to come gawk at us. 
Two waiters actually collided because they were too distracted while staring at us. Our confidence and casual ease were unfamiliar to them. I know they were not being mean-spirited, but I felt like an exotic animal in a zoo. 
Sometimes, the comments were not sexualized. There was one middle-aged woman who screamed at us from across the tracks at the Gallery Place-Chinatown Metro station. I recall we were holding plastic grocery bags from Chinatown, probably wearing t-shirts and shorts since it was a hot summer weekend (and unbearably humid for us Californians). 
I mention this because we weren't dressed in attention-getting outfits. We were waiting for the Metro after a morning of shopping in Chinatown. Yet this woman decided to start yelling at us from the other side of the tracks. I don't remember her entire minutes-long diatribe, but what stuck with me was the comment about our hair. ""You think you're so hot with your shiny straight hair."" 
I stared blankly at her in surprise, as I had struggled for years with changing my flat, stick straight hair into something closer to the big hair popular in the 1980s. I could never get it to feather or hold a curl, despite hours with a curling iron and a ton of Aqua Net. Ultimately, I begged my mom to let me get perms starting at age 11. I longed for full voluminous hair. While I stopped perming my hair by junior year of high school, I still couldn't believe someone would verbally attack us because of it. 
That incident inside the Metro station was early in the summer, so I was more embarrassed than angry. I worried we were drawing attention from the other Metro riders standing nearby. One of my friends, not wanting to let the insults go unaddressed, yelled back something like, ""Well, at least we don't smell!"" Twenty five years later, the retort makes me chuckle, but at that moment, I had just wanted to sink into the ground and disappear. 
We had multiple incidents throughout that summer. As the numbers grew, I stopped wondering what I was doing to provoke the others. I stopped being embarrassed. Instead, I was angry. Inhabiting an Asian body seemed to be the only constant. It didn't matter whether I was grocery shopping or walking to the Metro station. It didn't matter whether I was wearing a t-shirt and shorts or office attire. 
I explicitly note this because the unwanted racist and sexualized comments did not stop even if I tried to blend in with others. My Asian features always gave me away. 
I was relieved to return to California when the summer ended, but remained hyper-vigilant for racist, often sexualized harassment. While it happened far less often after returning to areas with a highly visible Asian American and Pacific Islander population, the most disturbing incident to ever happen to me occurred about 20 years ago in Berkeley, CA. 
I was walking from my apartment to the downtown Berkeley BART station. Since I was headed to a summer internship in San Francisco, it was early in the morning and there wasn't much pedestrian traffic yet. A young man on a bicycle suddenly appeared and followed me for several blocks until I got closer to Bancroft Ave (a main thoroughfare where we approached more people). 
I tried to speed walk to get away from him but he just increased his speed on his bike. He continuously commented about my body and what he wanted to do to me, despite my telling him I had a boyfriend and asking him to leave me alone. As he became more graphic, I told him to f— off, threatened to pepper spray him, and then finally just ignored him for the last 2 blocks until he abruptly told me I was a bitch and left. 
Did I think he would actually do me harm? I saw that he clearly enjoyed my discomfort and fear, but he never made a move to close the distance between us so he could actually touch me. He seemed to relish having that power over me. Even now, I still don't know what I could have done differently. 
I remember telling my then-boyfriend, now husband, later that day about how I wish I had thrown my shoe at him. Or maybe I should have rushed at him and pushed him off his bike. As it is, I never wore that outfit again because I cringed every time I saw it. It reminded me how he made me feel so vulnerable and helpless. 
— 
There were more incidents, but with the exception of one man someone old enough to be my father who slapped my ass as I walked past him on a busy street in Berkeley, none of them involved physical contact. Yet these all remain vivid in my memory even when many other happier memories have faded away. 
I had fewer interactions with random members of the public after I finished my studies, married, and moved to the suburbs. For nearly ten years, I commuted to work via bus. Waiting for the bus, I stood in line in a suburban park-and-ride lot and on a University campus on the other end. This meant I no longer had to deal with street harassment. 
Yet even then, as a young mother taking the commuter bus, I had a bus driver yell at me to shut up when I gave instructions in Chinese to an elderly Chinese couple. They didn't know which stop to get off at and had asked me to help them. All three of us sat in shocked silence until we reached the couple's stop and I signaled it was time for them to get off without speaking. 
In retrospect, I wonder whether the driver assumed we were talking about her, as many people inevitably do when they don't understand another language. Or perhaps she was just racist - believing that Asian people who don't speak English don't deserve any respect. When the couple got off the bus, they said thank you to me AND the bus driver, and they even waved kindly at her. I was fuming, yet I did nothing. I didn't even bother reporting her rude behavior to the Transit Agency. I figured it wouldn't do anything and she would continue to snap at anyone who spoke in a language other than English around her. 
Today, in 2021, I'm a middle aged mom who is less worried about how to deal with racist and sexualized harassment, but who continues to worry about the influence of white supremacy on all our interactions. While most of the incidents I experienced earlier in my life involved white men, there were also BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of color) men and women who initiated aggressive encounters. 
I also fully acknowledge that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are just as susceptible to charges of racism, too, especially newer immigrants who don't question the anti-Black racism prevalent in so much of American culture. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders don't always recognize how our struggles mirror those in other communities and that our privilege and yearning for ""a better life"" is often tied to the oppression of another community. White supremacy has brainwashed all of us and continues to impact our lives as Americans. 
I think of how little has changed and I worry for young people, especially my own two daughters. I worry about the racist and sexualized harassment they will endure once we emerge from this pandemic and they leave our home. The one consolation I have is that they have better answers for anyone who questions their credentials as Americans. My husband is a fifth- generation American of Chinese descent. His great-great grandparents were among the Chinese who immigrated to Honolulu and San Francisco more than 100 years ago. 
I can't wait until someone tries to ask my daughters where they are REALLY from and then try to ask about their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents. Yet I also know that our faces mark us as perpetual foreigners in America, no matter how many generations of our family have lived here. 
Some of what I've shared here will resonate with my Latinx brothers and sisters. Yet I recognize my experiences and concerns pale in comparison to my friends who worry about police and other armed individuals violently threatening their sons and daughters. I think this is why I, as an American of Asian descent, never felt like I could speak up about these relatively minor incidents knowing other BIPOC communities have had devastating stories of racism that led to much deeper and long-lasting pain. 
Each individual incident I've recounted is like a small cut not enough to sever an artery but enough to cause some pain and make us fear what might come next. 
I know Asian American and Pacific Islanders are often portrayed as highly successful professionals because we are over- represented in many elite spheres. That is also a result of a skewed immigration system that severely restricted immigration from Asia until 1965, when then opened the doors to highly educated immigrants. The preferential treatment meant that top scientists, engineers, medical professionals, and other highly educated folks were over-represented in the immigrant communities from the Asia Pacific region. 
Yet there have been Filipino, Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Korean, and other immigrants from Asia since before the U.S. was a nation. Our history in the U.S. is also seeped in the blood of victims of violence - Chinatowns were burned and Chinese men lynched during the Gold Rush days, Vincent Chin was murdered in 1982 because out-of-work auto workers thought he was Japanese, and Balbir Singh Sodhi was killed days after 9/11 because his attacker thought he was Muslim. 
Anti-Asian sentiment has also been enshrined in the law for a significant part of our nation's history, from the Chinese Exclusion Act (the only American law to exclude immigrants from a specific racial background), to the government-ordered incarceration of Japanese Americans during WWII (a majority of whom were American citizens!). 
Few Americans know this history, though. Moreover, the recent economic success of some Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders has overshadowed many of the struggles that lay the groundwork for current achievements. So the verbal abuse against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders isn't contextualized and is often quickly dismissed by even Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders themselves. We cannot let our ignorance of the history of Asians and Pacific Islanders in the U.S. shield us from the racism that has hounded generations. 
Dismissing the behavior because the offenders didn't cause physical harm means we don't acknowledge that there is still cumulative pain. Moreover, as we have all learned recently after the murders of six Asian American women who worked at the spas in Atlanta (as well as the murder of a white female customer and white male employee), strangers targeting Asian Americans can absolutely lead to horrific violence. (Editor note: Anna wrote this story prior to the shooting deaths of eight workers at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis, including four Sikhs). I think the behavior escalates when perpetrators get away 
with the ""low-level hate."" So I speak up today because I think we must critically examine the racist and sexualized verbal abuse many BIPOC women have endured and address how it impacts us all. 
For the past year, while we battled COVID, Asian American and Pacific Islander women have endured a disproportionate share of that abuse, per the same Stop AAPI Hate report referenced earlier. We need to stop the normalization of verbal abuse against anyone and in particular, against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in 2021. Bystanders need to speak up and support the targets of such abuse. Silence is deafening and only reinforces the power of the abuser. 
We should ask why these incidents are happening and do something. Dehumanizing my community is what leads to greater violence. Whether it's a microaggression or it's behavior that is more threatening, we need to address the racism that carves up so many of us. It's time to take the knife away.I sit on the Board of Directors for Chinese for Affirmative Action, a 51 year old civil rights nonprofit which co-founded Stop AAPI Hate, a national coalition aimed at addressing anti-Asian discrimination amid the pandemic. We have been tracking acts of anti-AAPI hate since March 2020 and our report is available here. Donate to CAA here.I use Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, Asian American, and Asian descent in different contexts throughout this piece. Even though I am of Chinese descent, I identify as an Asian American. Politically, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have been united as a single category for many purposes in the US, even though we face some distinctly different challenges.

Our voices are rising: Speaking out on anti-Asian racism too long endured.,"Cheung, Becky M",Others,2021-04-04,"Some of my earliest childhood memories were acts of discrimination and racism. 
I remember when my classmates slanted their eyes and sang at me in fake Chinese on the playground. I remember when their parents aggressively asked, ""No, where are you really from?"" as if ""Philly"" couldn't possibly be an answer. I remember grown men on the street asked me ""to love them long time"" while leering at my pubescent body. 
I remember my parents' laundromat windows being smashed in, and the police officers that couldn't be bothered to step out of their cars once they showed up at the scene and then saw our faces. My parents swept up the broken shards of glass and never brought it up again. 
I remember when my sister's car was keyed with the word Chink, when my parents were egged, robbed, and told to ""go back to their country,"" and all the times I was told that I ate dogs and carried disease. 
Yet I don't remember a time I confided in anyone. Not a soul. I never even realized these incidents were hate crimes until well into my 20s. 
I grew up in the 1990s in Philadelphia, and my family simply did not have a language for racism. I was never taught about microaggressions, white privilege, or institutionalized racism. All I knew was the constant feeling of discomfort, insecurity, and threat, but never understanding why. 
This was further undermined by peers and adults, who gaslit my emotions by stating ""it was all a joke"" or calling my tears ""overly sensitive."" Teachers, bus drivers, and my peers' parents, who often witnessed others openly screaming racial slurs and taunts, never said a word. These adults colluded to instill an atmosphere of silence and indifference. 
I accepted this racism because I didn't know any different. This was my normal. I truly never understood that I as a person my culture, my language, and my community - deserved to be respected. 
A significant reason why I lacked the language was I didn't know the history of my people. Only when I began to read more about Black Americans' history and struggle for equal rights did the lightbulb turn on. I realized that what happened and is still happening to communities of color is not right. Only then did I gradually begin to connect my own experiences to America's long history of colonialism and occupation in Asia, unconstitutional legal sanctions, internments, mob lynchings, and genocide of Asian communities and other communities of color. 
― 
Based on many U.S. textbooks, history seems to have forgotten. For that reason, anti-Asian crimes, like those against my parents and like the recent Atlanta mass shootings - are often incorrectly treated as isolated robberies, random assaults, or civil disputes rather than hate crimes. 
― 
The culture of conformity and immigrant vulnerability perpetuated my parents' silence. It drove the shame of being targeted, the desire to avoid confrontation, the traumatic detachment, as well as a healthy mistrust of law enforcement, who could be as dismissive and hostile as our attackers. 
My parents also believed that if we assimilated with those around us, we could achieve success. We didn't realize whole systems were invested in seeing our communities fail. When microaggressions and hate crimes occurred, we dealt with it by working harder to assimilate. I internalized a sense that I don't matter and what happens to me doesn't matter. Even as I write this now, there is a part of me that questions, ""Why would anyone care?"" 
But after a year of witnessing escalating anti-Asian violence, I found myself sobbing and burdened by sleepless nights. It has retriggered decades of pain and humiliation. I suddenly realized how little I processed a lifetime of trauma. 
Then, I chose what previously felt unthinkable: I shared my story with others on social media. The childhood taunts, the fetishization, the vandalism, the assaults, the glares during COVID lockdown, the three eggings of my house, one on Lunar New Year's Eve. After the Atlanta shootings, I saw other people 
speaking out about their experiences for the first time, sharing their all-too-familiar attacks, harassment, and fear. Despite being friends, we as a community had for so long suffered in individual isolation. 
Our collective silence unknowingly reinforced the stereotype that we are white-adjacent, not in need of support or resources, because ""bad things"" don't happen to us. People wonder why we are so ""hysterical"" because apparently anti-Asian racism only started a year ago. But they are finally questioning the validity of that narrative, which locked out AAPI communities from discussions on civil rights that extended to equal pay, prison reform, and school, workplace, and health-care protections. That narrative treats Asian communities as a monolith and shuts out the diaspora of diverse perspectives and needs. 
Speaking out, and finally naming the hate we experience, is a revolutionary act one I am proudly seeing more and more. It is difficult enough that the world outside AAPI communities colludes to maintain silence. We should not add to it ourselves. We deserve to be respected simply because we exist, not for what we can produce or offer. Our voices, demands, and concerns should be heard. Our hate crimes should be seen and charged as hate crimes. For the first time in my lifetime, I am joyously moved by the choir of voices leading this charge.

Another 'Other',None,Others,2021-04-01					,"In the last year, Asian Americans have suffered at least 3,795 hate incidents. The upsurge in this disturbing trend seems to stem from some level of ""blame"" associated with the coronavirus outbreak in China, and the taunting, finger-pointing and name-calling that was shared widely as the dreaded virus spread around the world. 
The pandemic has put us all on edge. But there is absolutely no excuse for the transfer of blame for the virus or anything associated with it to our Asian American community generally, or to elderly Asian Americans who have been attacked while walking through the streets of several major metropolitan U.S. cities. 
It makes no sense. But reading the reports and hearing the disquieting stories of the Asian American victims makes it real. And for our community, the stories are disturbingly familiar. 
In a recent article in The Washington Post, Jeff Chang described the thinking behind epithets like ""China virus"" and ""Kung flu"" as the result of ""the twisted logic that connects two opposed, infernal ideas: that Asians and Asian Americans are impure and inferior - and if not stopped, they will conquer our world."" Disturbing, indeed. Replace 'Asian"" and ""Asian American"" with ""Jew,"" and long-lived and reviled anti-Semitic canards are brought back in full color. Quite simply, blaming a Chinese American grandmother in New York City for the spread of the coronavirus is not much different from believing that your grandmother has control of Jewish space lasers. 
During the past few years, we have seen a distressing reawakening of aggression and hate crimes against minorities, including a serious uptick in anti-Semitic activity. Our sense of complacency has been disrupted. As the poisonous infection of hate grows, other vulnerable communities are inevitably targeted. Suddenly, our nation of immigrants transforms into a nation of scapegoats, as we fall victim to a rising blame culture and the politics of anger. 
We can do better, and we must. We need to stop the hate and embrace the hated. Our Asian American friends have done nothing wrong. Yet they have suffered a disturbing history of anti-Chinese immigration legislation, anti-miscegenation laws and the internment of Japanese Americans. Today's threats and violence are unfortunately nothing new - the animosity and hate simply never went away.And now, they are simply rearing their ugly heads, again. 
We urge our community to see the recent threats and attacks on Asian Americans as a wake-up call. This is our opportunity to reach out to our neighbors and to give them comfort, support and empathy. That is the way coalitions of caring and relationships of trust are built. 
Let's make clear to our Asian American neighbors that they can count on us. We will certainly appreciate their support when the wheel turns. But beyond that, it is the right thing to do.

"Panel to discuss anti-Asian hate for UT town hall; 3,795 U.S. incidents in 12 months","Sutherland, Brooks",Others,2021-04-04											,"The stories are horrific. 
A shooting rampage that killed eight people, six of whom were Asian women, in Atlanta. An elderly Asian woman kicked in her stomach and stomped in the face in broad daylight in New York. A Thai immigrant in his 80s, fatally shoved to the ground in San Francisco. And an 89-year-old Chinese woman slapped in the face and set on fire in Brooklyn, N.Y. 
A string of recent hate crimes against Asian-Americans has the nation grappling with how to address and confront the issue. And following a year of racist rhetoric toward people of Asian descent amid the coronavirus pandemic, stories of blatant discrimination against the minority group have increasingly come to forefront. 
But Asian-Americans haven't just been targeted during the pandemic, An Chung Cheng, a Spanish professor at the University of Toledo, told The Blade on Friday. Systemic discrimination against Asian-Americans has persisted for years, she said. 
What happened in the past year is not only just because of the pandemic, or hate rhetoric, Ms. Cheng said. All of this can be rooted back in history. 
Ms. Cheng and four other panelists will give a presentation on Asian-American discrimination and have an open dialogue at a virtual town-hall discussion Tuesday. The program, Stop Anti-Asian Hate, The Fight to Eliminate Racism in All Forms, will tackle systemic and institutionalized discrimination against Asian-Americans, and look at some of the problem's roots, Ms. Cheng said. 
According to Stop Hate AAPI, an activist organization that labels itself as a reporting center created to track and respond to hate crimes against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States, 3,795 reports of hate incidents were documented in the country during the 12 months that ended with February. It's a number that doesn't take into account for other hateful incidents that aren't even classified as hate crimes. 
It's very difficult to prosecute hate crimes, Ms. Cheng said. But it doesn't mean that hate crimes don't exist or prejudice 
against Asian-Americans doesn't exist. 
We would like to increase the dialogue, she added. Because of the violence against Asian-Americans, particularly to the most vulnerable groups like elders, the Asian-American community is starting to feel like we need to stand up. 
In March, 2020, the FBI warned of a potential surge in hate crimes against Asian-Americans during the pandemic. That didn't stop many elected officials from using hateful rhetoric many activist groups say encourages bigotry and hate towards Asians. 
Former President Trump began the verbal attacks in 2020, referring to the coronavirus as the China Virus, Chinese virus, and Kung Flu. Several Republicans followed suit. Just last week, Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted referred to the coronavirus as the Wuhan Virus, in a tweet and later doubled down on the message, explaining he only meant to criticize the Chinese government. 
But that rhetoric sends the wrong message to Americans, Ms. Cheng said, and in some cases has severe consequences. 
The general public does not know who is Chinese, or Korean, or Japanese, she said. And so all of us who look like Asians will be targeted, and be scapegoats, and be blamed for the pandemic. 
Federal hate-crime data has not yet been released for 2020. Hate crimes in 2019 were the highest in more than a decade. 
Sara Clark, director of UT's center for international studies and programs, will moderate the discussion, which takes place virtually at noon on Tuesday and can be streamed via Webex. 
In addition to Ms. Cheng, the panel will feature: Joseph Hara, director of UT's Japanese program; Hua Liu Sowa, an education student at UT; Carolyn Sowa, a Toledo native who is studying international law at Beijing University, and Xinren Yu, assistant director for UT's center for international studies and programs. 
The town hall is the 13th in a UT series of discussions called Dialogues on Diversity, that began after George Floyd, a Black man, was controversially killed by a police officer in Minneapolis last year.

"Asian-Americans Feel the Hate; In the woke narrative, it's all about Trump, Covid-19 and white supremacy.","McGurn, William",Others,2021-04-05					,"Amid the growing attacks on Asian-Americans, the recent crimes of Brandon Elliot and Robert Aaron Long bear particular attention. The way these two prominent cases are being reported in the press illuminates some of the holes in the new narrative of ""hate."" 
Start with Mr. Elliot's brutal Midtown Manhattan beatdown of a 65-year old Filipina while shouting at her, ""You don't belong here."" Mr. Elliot did this while out on lifetime parole for murdering his mother in 2002. Meanwhile in Atlanta, Robert Aaron Long, a 21-year-old white man, has confessed to gunning down eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at three area massage parlors. 
In the dominant narrative, these attacks are but the latest manifestations of a system built for white supremacy. If Asian-Americans find themselves attacked, the Biden White House explains in a memo, it's because of pols who called Covid-19 names like ""Wuhan flu"" and thus ""stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes."" 
At best this narrative is highly misleading. Messrs. Elliot and Long are living examples why. 
Start with Mr. Long, who told police he shot up those massage parlors to remove sexual temptation. He denied he killed the women because they were Asian. Perhaps evidence to the contrary will appear, but as yet it hasn't. 
That hasn't stopped almost every press report from lumping Atlanta in with all the other attacks deliberately targeting Asian-Americans, or from implying it's somehow Mr. Trump's fault, or both. A classic of the genre was a March 19 New York Times piece about the Atlanta killings under the headline ""Racism and Sexism Shadow Many Interactions for Asian-American Women."" It checked all the boxes: ""racialized misogyny,"" ""the Trump administration repeatedly emphasized China's connection to the Covid-19 pandemic,"" ""capitalism based on racial exploitation""-even while conceding, much further down in the piece, that ""very little is known about the motives of the Atlanta gunman."" 
Meanwhile, the woke obsession with race and hate works to diminish both the crime and the specific facts surrounding it. Is the murder of eight innocent people any less heinous if the motivation wasn't race hatred? 
Mr. Elliot's crime is an even tougher fit for the white-supremacy narrative because the 38-year-old attacker is African-American. What makes him particularly embarrassing is that his example raises the larger issue of black-on-Asian crime, which the narrative's champions are desperate to suppress or ignore. 
In a thoughtful March 19 piece for the Weekly Dish on how debilitating this is for news coverage, Andrew Sullivan cites the Justice Department's 2019 Criminal Victimization report to note that ""of those committing violence against Asians, you discover that 24 percent such attacks are committed by whites; 24 percent are committed by fellow Asians, 7 percent by Hispanics; and 27.5 percent by African-Americans."" 
Five days later, a Voice of America article put it this way: ""In New York City, where anti-Asian hate crime soared nearly nine-fold in 2020 over the year before, only two of the 20 people arrested last year in connection with these attacks were white, according to New York Police Department 
data analyzed by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. Eleven were African Americans, six were white Hispanics and one was a Black Hispanic."" 
Assaults on Asian-Americans cannot easily be squeezed into a progressive narrative of white supremacy. Moreover, criminal attacks on Asian- Americans were going on long before Mr. Trump and Covid-19 arrived on the scene. 
As for the Asian-American community, which is itself highly diverse, it is far from monolithic in its reaction. On one side, there are left-leaning outfits such as Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks hate incidents and appears all-in for the narrative. The outfit is the creation of other groups such as Chinese for Affirmative Action, one of the several Asian-American organizations to endorse Proposition 16, last year's failed ballot initiative to overturn California's ban on race preferences. 
On the other side, there is a growing worry among Asian-Americans about what identity politics and the progressive narrative about race means for them. Last week some of these advocacy groups announced a new coalition, whose first demand is for the Biden Justice Department to reinstate the lawsuit against Yale for using race preferences to discriminate against Asian-American applicants-another issue progressives would prefer to ignore. Rather than invocations of left-wing abstractions such as critical race theory, what these people want are common-sense protections that will keep them safe and free from discrimination. 
""Asian Americans don't need narratives,"" says Linda Yang, director of Washington Asians for Equality. ""We need the truth. And we need the people who commit these terrible crimes to be condemned, prosecuted and properly identified-no matter what race they are."" ",5091
Asian Americans share how they are dealing with racism,"MEJIA, BRITTNY ",Others,2021-04-07,"LOS ANGELES - As Syl Tang boarded an elevator in New York City, a woman pulled up the corner of her eye in a familiar gesture mocking Asians. 
The woman then launched into a coronavirus tirade - she had stayed at home for a year and done everything right, yet ""a foreigner"" gave her the virus. 
Tang's anger rose as she found herself in that well-trodden crossroad faced by anyone targeted because of race, gender, sexual orientation or religion: stay quiet, or say or do something and possibly risk an escalation? 
For many Asian Americans, from immigrants to fifth generation, incidents like the one Tang endured have been an all too normal part of their lives - usually not rising to physical attacks but feeling at times like a window into a deeper well of hate. 
Now, a recent spate of attacks against Asians - including the mass shooting in Atlanta that killed eight people, including six Asian women have put a spotlight on more commonplace incidents of bigotry.
The verbal harassment happens in elevators, restaurant bathrooms, taxis and public sidewalks, thrusting victims into a situation for which there is no playbook. 
Do you make a joke of it, laugh it off and try to make the moment end? Silently walk away? Explain why the words were hurtful? Tell the person off? 
What if, as in videos captured across the country, the encounter turns violent? 
Inside the elevator, others chimed in and said that COVID-19 had been ""brought here."" Tang decided to say something. 
""I would like you to know that I'm vaccinated,"" said Tang, who wanted the woman to hear that she spoke English fluently and without an accent. 
""I wasn't going to get into a fight in an elevator with this woman, but it was very clear to me that in her eyes, I was a foreigner,"" Tang, 48, who is Chinese American, said later. 
Tang, the author of a world affairs book, has endured racist incidents on a weekly basis, even before the pandemic. 
Once, a group of tourists pulled her out of a cab while telling her to ""go back to squatting on the ground in my pajamas in China."" Another time, a woman shoved her off a subway train onto the platform and called her a derogatory term for Chinese people. Countless times as she walks down the street, men have shouted, ""Me love you long time,"" ""Ching chong ni hao"" or ""Konichiwa"" and then, when ignored, followed up with expletives. 
A month ago, a woman spit on her in a restaurant bathroom, saying she didn't ""want to get the coronavirus."" 
""I think you take it incident by incident. You try to assess whether it's worth it to fight back, whether it's worth it to say something,"" Tang said. ""I have yelled back at racist slurs on the street. When people say things to me, especially if they assume I don't speak English, I have some choice words for them."" 
But to respond every time would feel akin to living in a constant state of combat. 
""If you've been going through this for decades, you go through periods where you're really angry, periods where you're resigned, then you're really angry again, then you're resigned,"" Tang said. ""You sort of go back and forth. ... Mentally, you may always want to fight back and you may always want to speak up, but you get tired."" 
Before Los Angeles musician John Bach goes on tour with a new band and crew, he sits them down to ""have the talk"" about racist comments and physical attacks he will likely get - especially when it's a tour through the Deep South or the Midwest. 
The 36-year-old, who has been a professional drummer for 17 years and is of Korean descent, has been told, ""I've never seen an Oriental play drums before"" and ""Didn't know a Chinaman can do much else besides math. Let me buy you a beer."" 
He ignores the racial stereotypes embedded in the comments and maintains a friendly demeanor. 
""I usually deflect and ignore statements. I don't respond in anger, ever, unless I have to defend myself, which is pretty rare, although it does happen,"" said Bach, who was born in South Korea and moved to California when he was 6. ""I approach the situation as I would with any other fan. Just keep the mood light, take whatever it is 
that they say as a compliment."" 
Some people, including former President Donald Trump, have blamed Asian Americans for the coronavirus because it first emerged in China. 
Last March, Manjusha Kulkarni was in a hair salon when she overheard two white women saying that Asians spread disease because of the food they eat, citing bats. She weighed whether to say something. 
""There's a social etiquette of not challenging things,"" said Kulkarni, the executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and the co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate. ""We're socialized not to say things to people. It's rude. It's potentially disrespectful."" 
So Kulkarni said, shaking as she did: ""I apologize for interrupting your conversation. I have to tell you what you're saying is inaccurate."" 
""I thought that was the mildest thing I could say and still, their answer to me was, 'You misunderstood what we were saying,"""" Kulkarni recalled. 
Along with the trauma suffered in the moment, there are the lingering questions: Could I have said something differently? What if I had said this instead? 
""I would feel worse not doing something than doing something, but that's in environments that were still safe,"" Kulkarni said. ""If you asked me, 'Would I do it alone around a big man?' No, I would not."" ",5409
U.S. can be safe for all: Teach compassion,"Nguyen-Tran, Barbara",Others,2021-04-04							,"I had posted this on my Facebook page and had so many people request that I share it. Thank you to all who have reached out to us this week to check in on us because of the recent events that have led to surges of violence against Asian Americans. 
It is hard to ignore and dismiss all the devastating incidents COVID-19 has brought upon us. It is even harder to grasp the devastation brought upon the Asian American community due to the mockery and dehumanizing slander that has been thrust upon us in the past year, instilling fear and frustration in our daily lives. 
My parents emigrated from Vietnam after the war with literally nothing and had to start over in a foreign country where they knew no one and didn't speak a word of English. Life was hard for them with three little children and very little help from the community. 
Thus, they were just grateful they were given the opportunity to start anew and perhaps live the American dream through assimilating and adopting a new culture. Little did they know racism, discrimination and social inequality are also a part of their American dream. 
I was brought up in a suburb of Texas and was made aware daily of my unusual features as well as my refugee status. I was constantly bullied for looking different. At the time, we were the sole Vietnamese family in the community, and the only exposure people had to us was what was going on through the media about the war and fleeing refugees. 
It didn't matter how hard I tried to fit in. I was never going to look, speak or be American enough to be accepted among the other kids. I remember in grade school I was cornered in the restroom and held in a headlock by a redheaded girl who was twice my size. No one stood up for me, not even the school principal. 
My parents were called in and told that I must have provoked the girl. It made me so ashamed for wasting my parents' time. I didn't want to take the time away from my parents while they were working to put food on the table and clothes on our backs. After many similar incidents, I came to realize that staying silent and making myself invisible would make me less of a target - thus, not bringing shame to my family for getting called to school. 
Being Vietnamese immigrants in a foreign country, we did not want to ruffle anyone's feathers and just wanted to blend into our community. 
Never in a million years could I imagine reliving all the horrible things I endured as an immigrant child. I've had over 47 years to navigate the struggles of being Asian American and have come to embrace my ethnicity. 
My children, on the other hand, struggle day to day with being ""different."" My son works at Starbucks and was told by a customer that he ""didn't want the Chinese boy to make his coffee,"" as if he could catch COVID-19 from a barista through coffee. My other son wears hoodies and hides behind sunglasses so he doesn't expose his ""Asian"" features. I hope and pray that someday they will have the confidence to be Asian and prideful enough to embrace their ethnicity. As a parent, I am frustrated and even more intolerant of the racism, discrimination and injustices that have made their way into our daily lives. This is our reality. This is the cruel world we live in. 
As painful as it is to see all the racial injustice and inequality that still exists today as it did then, I am still hopeful of a brighter and better future for my children. By raising awareness, we are not only teaching our future generations the importance of kindness toward Asian Americans, but kindness, respect and compassion toward all people. We have to show our children how critical it is to come together to make our community and the United States more inclusive, equitable and safe for all. Please take the time to be kind and empathetic toward each other and not pass judgment before we know someone's story, someone's pain and someone's hardship. 
Barbara Nguyen-Tran, a Vietnamese refugee who came to the U.S. in 1978, has lived in Dallas, Los Angeles and now resides in Albuquerque. She has owned and operated a nail salon in Santa Fe for over 25 years.

Suspect arrested in NYC attack on Asian American woman news briefing,From,Others,2021-04-01,"NEW YORK - A parolee convicted of killing his mother nearly two decades ago was arrested on assault and hate crime charges in an attack on an Asian American woman in New York City, police said Wednesday. 
Police said Brandon Elliot, 38, is the man seen on surveillance video kicking and stomping the woman Monday near Times Square. They said Elliot was living at a hotel that serves as a homeless shelter a few blocks from the scene of the attack. 
He was taken into custody at the hotel around midnight. Tips from the public led to his apprehension, police said. 
Elliot was convicted of stabbing his mother to death in the Bronx borough of New York in 2002, when he was 19. He was released from prison in 2019 and is on lifetime parole. The parole board had previously twice denied his release. 
Elliot, who is Black, faces charges of assault as a hate crime, attempted assault as a hate crime, assault and attempted assault in Monday's attack. It wasn't immediately known whether he had a lawyer who could speak on his behalf. 
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said prosecutors will seek to have Elliot jailed without bail pending trial. He faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted, Vance said. 
A law enforcement official identified the victim as Vilma Kari, 65. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and did so on condition of anonymity. 
Kari's daughter told The New York Times that her mother emigrated from the Philippines decades ago. 
Wisconsin mask mandate: The Wisconsin Supreme Court struck down Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' statewide mask mandate Wednesday, stripping the governor of one of his last remaining tools to curb the spread of the coronavirus. 
The conservative-leaning court ruled 4-3 that Evers violated state law by unilaterally issuing multiple emergency orders to extend the mandate for months. 
It found that Evers needed legislative approval to issue more orders after the expiration of the initial 60-day mandate he issued in August. 
The decision marks another legal defeat for Evers. 
The state Supreme Court in May struck down his stay-at-home order, finding that his health secretary lacked the authority to issue such an order. 
A state appeals court blocked Evers' attempts to limit capacity in bars, restaurants and other indoor places in October. 
AstraZeneca vaccine: The head of the European Medicines Agency said Wednesday that there is ""no evidence"" that would support restricting the use of AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine in any population, as Germany has now done amid concerns over rare blood clots in people who got the shot. 
But EMA Executive Director Emer Cooke said her agency continues to study reports of new cases as they come in and will provide a further assessment next week. 
On Tuesday, an independent vaccine expert panel in Germany said AstraZeneca shots should not routinely be given to people under 60 because of a rise in reported cases of unusual blood clots in the days after vaccination. 
The German government followed the recommendation and said the British-Swedish company's vaccine would be prioritized for people age 60 and older, although exceptions can be made in consultation with doctors. 
The move put the spotlight back on the EMA, which authorized the AstraZeneca vaccine in January and said last month - after some European countries suspended its use over blood clot fears - that the vaccine's benefits outweigh the risks. 
Navalny on hunger strike: Imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny said Wednesday that he has started a hunger strike to protest authorities' failure to provide proper treatment for his back and leg pains. 
In a statement posted on Instagram, Navalny complained about prison officials' refusal to give him the right medicines and to allow his doctor to visit him behind bars. 
He also protested the hourly checks a guard makes on him at night. 
The 44-year-old Navalny, who is President Vladimir Putin's most outspoken domestic opponent, was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from a nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. 
Russian authorities have rejected the accusation. 
Navalny said he had no choice but to start a hunger strike because his physical condition has worsened, with back pains having spread to his right leg and numbness in his left leg. 
Last month, Navalny was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for violating the terms of his probation during convalescence. 
US on Hong Kong: Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday reaffirmed a determination made last year by the Trump administration that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous and remains undeserving of special treatment by the United States. 
In a notice sent to Congress, Blinken said China had continued to ""dismantle"" Hong Kong's autonomy since his predecessor, Mike Pompeo, first made the determination in May 2020. 
As a result, Blinken said, the former British colony does not warrant U.S. trade and financial perks it had enjoyed since it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997 with a pledge from Beijing that it would enjoy significant autonomy for 50 years. 
The decision is yet another indication that President Joe Biden's administration has not strayed from the hard line that was taken by President Donald Trump on China. 
On Tuesday, the State Department repeated the Trump administration's characterization of Chinese treatment of Uighur Muslims and other minorities in China's western Xinjiang region as ""genocide."" 
Pot now legal in NY: New York adults over 21 can now possess and use marijuana - even in public - under a legalization bill signed Wednesday by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Legal sales of recreational-use cannabis won't start for an estimated 18 months until regulations are set. 
Passed after several years of stalled efforts, the measure makes New York the 16th state to legalize adult use of the drug. 
In a unique provision, New Yorkers 21 and over can now smoke cannabis in public, including on sidewalks. No other state allows that, said Paul Armentano, deputy director of pro-legalization group NORML, 
Still, New Yorkers can't smoke or vape marijuana where smoking is prohibited by state law.",6208
"United States: Asian Man, 61, in Critical Condition After 'Horrific' N.Y.C. Attack",None,Others,2021-04-26,"New York City police are investigating if a ""horrific attack"" that left a 61-year-old Asian man in critical condition Friday night was racially motivated. 
The attack occurred around 8:30 pm when a man struck the victim from behind, ""causing him to fall to the ground"" in East Harlem, police said Saturday. 
Surveillance footage released by the New York Police Department's Hate Crimes Task Force, which is also investigating the incident, shows the man kicking the victim's head repeatedly while he is on the ground. 
Emergency medical personnel rushed the man, who has not been identified, to a local hospital, police said. 
No arrests have been made as of Saturday afternoon. 
While authorities have not determined if the victim was targeted because of his race, the incident comes amid a wave of racially-motivated attacks against Asian Americans nationwide, including one in New York City that was captured on camera and sparked widespread outrage last month. 
Vilma Kari, 65, who is of Filipino descent, was on her way to church on the moming of March 29 when she was attacked on West 43rd Street between 8th and 9th Avenues in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, police said. 
Police released video that showed a man kicking the victim in her stomach, causing her to fall to the ground. The man then stomped the woman's head multiple times while making anti-Asian statements, police said. 
Kari was treated at the hospital for a fractured pelvis, Manhattan District Attomey Cy Vance Jr. said. 
Brandon Elliot, 38, was charged with two counts of assault in the second degree as a hate crime, and one count of attempted assault in the first degree as a hate crime, in connection with the attack, according to the DA. 
The spike in hate crimes nationwide was first seen in March and April of last year at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic amid ""negative stereotyping of Asians relating to the pandemic,"" according to an analysis of official preliminary police data by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. 
While hate crimes decreased overall by 7 percent last year, those targeting Asian people rose by nearly 150 percent across 16 of the nation's largest cities in 2020, the analysis found. 
New York accounted for the largest surge from three in 2019 to 28 in 2020, an 833 percent increase. 
The uptick in cases prompted the US Senate to pass legislation Thursday targeting anti-Asian hate crimes. 
The bill, introduced by Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, in March, would direct the Department of Justice to expedite the review of hate crimes related to COVID-19 that were reported to law enforcement agencies and help them establish ways to report such incidents online and perform public outreach. 
It would also direct the attorney general and the Department of Health and Human Services to issue best-practices guidance on how to mitigate racially discriminatory language in describing the pandemic. - FNA",2979
"Woman Arrested After Spewing Anti-Asian Hate at Several People, Including Plainclothes Officer","Tamanaha, Akemi",Others,2021-04-08,"Police arrested a woman accused of shouting anti-Asian hate at several people in a Manhattan salon, including a plainclothes New York Police Department officer, New York Daily News reports. 
Sharon Williams, 50, entered Good Choice for Nails salon on Madison St. near James St around 5 p.m. on Tuesday and began shouting at workers. 
""You brought the corona to this country,"" she allegedly said. 
Police say she also used Asian slurs and threatened violence, according to WLNY. She then allegedly walked outside and began shouting at an Asian American man. The man she reportedly called a ""Chinese motherf--"" was a plainclothes NYPD officer. 
The officer called for backup and Williams was arrested. She is charged with aggravated harassment as a hate crime and criminal trespass. 
The arrest comes on the heels of a recent NYPD initiative announced last month. The NYPD said it would be deploying undercover Asian American officers to combat the rise in Asian American hate crimes, The Hill reports. 
""The next person you target, whether it's through speech, menacing activity, or anything else, walking along a sidewalk or a train platform, may be a plainclothes New York City police officer. So think twice,"" NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said last week, according to The Hill. ",1281
Anti-Asian hate crimes jumped 74% in NJ in 2020: COVID-19's origin has caused serious backlash,"Chung, Joshua",Others,2021-04-26,"As the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the state and the country last year, the number of anti-Asian bias incidents —
which includes shunning, racial slurs and physical attacks — went up by nearly 75% within the past year, data released by
the New Jersey State Police show.
COVID-19's origin in Wuhan, China, has caused a significant backlash against Asian Americans across the United States for
the past year and New Jersey has seen its fair share of discrimination toward Asian Americans, said U.S. Rep. Andy Kim,
an Asian American Democrat representing New Jersey's 3rd Congressional District.
Experts say the COVID-19 pandemic did not start this new trend of discrimination toward the Asian American community,
but rather gave people an ""excuse"" to target them and highlights the long history of bigotry against them.
""I believe those statistics are being under-reported and that discrimination against Asian Americans in our country existed
far before COVID-19 and it will last after COVID-19,"" Kim said.
Anti-Asian bias reports, which involve Asian or Pacific Islander individuals, jumped 74%, from 39 in 2019 to 68 in 2020
across the state, according to preliminary data compiled from the New Jersey State Police. However, these statistics are
based off what is only reported to police, as experts and officials believe there are more cases that go underreported.
""I am terrified,"" said Nina Gao, president of the Asian American Alliance of South Jersey and a Shanghai native who lives in
Cherry Hill. ""I think a lot of my friends feel the same way, you know, is this safe anymore? Yes, a lot of these attacks you
see happening in the city, but if it doesn't stop, is it going to happen tomorrow or a year down the road in the suburbs?""
Here is a breakdown of reported bias incidents against Asian Americans by county across New Jersey:
Bergen: 14
Burlington: 1
Camden: 2
Essex: 1
Gloucester: 1
Hudson: 4
Mercer: 7
Middlesex: 14
Monmouth: 10
Morris: 1
Passaic: 2
Somerset: 5
Sussex: 1
Union: 3
Warren: 1
Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland, Hunterdon, Ocean, and Salem counties did not see any incidents of bias against Asian
Americans over the past year, according to New Jersey State Police. The report did not specify type of incident by county.
Asian Americans reside in all 21 counties and in every part of the state. There are approximately 960,000 Asian American
residents, or 10% of the total New Jersey population.
The number of reported incidents seem to track by population: In Middlesex County, about 25% of the total county
population is Asian American as of 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Bergen has an Asian population of 16%,
while Hudson, Somerset, Mercer and Monmouth have populations of more than 10%.
Across New Jersey, bias incidents among all groups — not just Asian American and Pacific Islanders — involving aggravated
assault rose by 18% from 2019 to 2020. Incidents involving a tactic of intimidation rose by 7.5%, while terroristic threats
skyrocketed by more than 103% from 32 reports in 2019 to 65 made in 2020.
The State Police report also detailed an increase in incidents targeting Black, Latino and LGBTQ communities, showing that
incidents of harassment and discrimination rose for the second straight year. In 2020, New Jersey recorded 1,441 bias
incidents, which was the highest total ever recorded and a 45% increase from 2019's total.
But nothing stood out more than incidents involving harassment, as New Jersey saw an increase of more than 72% in this
category — 421 in 2019 and then up to 726 incidents in 2020. Additionally, ""other"" forms of bias incidents, which includes
desecration of venerated objects, significantly rose by more than 278%, from 34 to 129 this past year.
For all race groups across New Jersey, simple assaults fell by about 4%, while bias incidents involving destruction, damage
or vandalism to one's property fell by 3.5%, according to the annual report.
Stop Asian American Pacific Islander Hate (Stop AAPI Hate), a nonprofit organization in California, recorded 3,795 incidents
of anti-Asian discrimination across the United States — a 26% increase from the prior year's 2,808 incidents. Some 42% of
the incidents were reported by Chinese Americans.
New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania were all in the top 10 for most reported incidents, the group's data showed.
Between March 19, 2020, through Feb. 28 of this year, shows that more than 500 incidents took place so far.
Below is a breakdown of the top 10 states with highest number of bias incidents against Asian Americans over the past
year, according to Stop AAPI Hate's report:
California: 1,691
New York: 517
Washington: 158
Texas: 103
Pennsylvania: 97
Massachusetts: 96
Illinois: 92
Florida: 59
New Jersey: 59
Maryland: 51
The most common types of discrimination involved harassment and shunning, which made up 68% and 20.5% of the
group's reports.
Physical assault was the third-most common category, making up 11% of the total incidents across the country. A quarter
of the incidents took place on public streets, while a third of the incidents occurred at businesses.
""I think the (COVID-19) pandemic and, the discrimination that we've seen, has been pouring gasoline on the fire over the
last year,"" Kim said. ""It's disturbing and I truly also believe that these numbers do not reflect the totality of what is going
on.""
COVID-19's impact
Asian history experts say the issue of harassment is nothing new for the Asian community, as a majority have dealt with
discrimination for decades. But there have been several high-profile incidents, such as the recent shootings in Atlanta-area
spas on March 16, in which six of the eight victims were Asian women, that have played a large part in highlighting the
issue.
Last March, a New York City man attacked a 65-year-old Asian American woman in broad daylight and hurled anti-Asian
insults at her as she walked down a midtown Manhattan street, according to New York City police.
The woman was later hospitalized with serious injuries after the attacker punched, kicked and stomped on her as staff and
bystanders did not intervene the incident. NYPD called the incident ""a hate crime assault,"" which later prompted a large
outcry amongst the Asian community for justice and change.
Earlier this month, Jonathan Russo, 27, was charged with multiple counts of assault and harassment, both as a hate crime,
in connection with pushing a 64-year-old Asian American woman on a sidewalk and knocking her down in New York,
assaulting a 32-year-old Asian American woman by grabbing her hair, and shoving a 77-year-old Asian American man to
the ground.
Richard Chen, 40, a web producer and a board member for the Asian American Action Fund, said anti-Asian discrimination
is nothing new across the tristate area, saying that even though he would often see people staring at him when the
pandemic first started, he believes many others have had it far worse in years past.
""Discrimination toward (Asians) has always been there, especially in New York,"" said Chen, a resident from Branchburg in
Somerset County. ""Sure, we usually get those typical stares because of where the virus started, but those who have been
harassed or assaulted because of it is completely unacceptable and is likely going to continue to be honest.""
Jennifer Ho, a professor of Asian American studies at University Colorado of Boulder and the director of Humanities and
Arts, said this topic is the story of the moment, and that the pandemic has only given people another reason to attack this
community.
Ho emphasized the recent violent attacks at Asian American seniors and women throughout the first few months of this
year, specifically videos that have surfaced across the mainstream media, has likely led to the increase of reports recorded
by the Stop AAPI Hate nonprofit organization.
""I want to say that with the violence we're seeing now and with all the racism and the videos that came out last year
against African Americans, the reports are increasing because of the national attention it is receiving,"" Ho said.
""Prior to this year, when was the last time you honestly saw this much attention on racism against Asian Americans?""
Additionally, the report released by the AAPI anti-hate organization also showed that Asian women made up 68% of the
total incidents, compared with men, who made up 29% of all incidents recorded.
In the Stop AAPI Hate report, victims of anti-Asian harassment sent in their stories to the organization, which included one
Filipino American woman reporting that while in a Washington, D.C., metro station with her boyfriend, an unknown man
shouted at her ""Chinese b----,"" then proceeded to cough at the couple and physically threaten them.
It didn't begin with the pandemic
In 1871 in Los Angeles, around 500 white and Hispanic people murdered 19 Chinese residents in the so-called Chinese
massacre — a buildup of a growing anti-Asian culture that played a part in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which
banned the immigration of Chinese laborers. It was the nation's first set of immigration laws to ban individuals based on
race.
Japan's bombing on Pearl Harbor in 1941 resulted in the internment of most Japanese Americans across the West Coast to
barracks and camps in remote areas during World War II, with the federal government deeming them a possibly disloyal
security risk. Over 127,000 Japanese Americans were placed in camps in the United States during the war and over 1,800
died in the camps.
Jason Oliver-Chang, a professor at the University of Connecticut whose research focuses on Asian American studies and
American immigration history, said Asian Americans were used as a racial wedge after World War II and the Vietnam War.
""Japanese Americans were used as a racial wedge in the '40s and '50s, as with an American allied victory in World War II,
there was then a need to claim victory at home as well,"" Oliver-Chang said. ""People at this time were arguing to fight
fascism abroad and fascism at home and in some respects, people looked to the recovery of Japanese Americans from the
incarceration experience during World War II, as evidence of the United States overcoming the color line.""
Oliver-Chang said even though the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s played a major step in overcoming the racial
barriers in the United States, Asian American voices still did not receive as much attention.
""I think it helps to explain some of the absence of Asian American voices during these time periods because Asian
Americans were drawing from the harsh treatment and atrocities happening in Japan, Vietnam and in Southeast Asia, to
inform others of their own treatment in the United States,"" Oliver-Chang said.
Congressman Kim, the son of Korean immigrants, said he has also had his fair share of experiences with racism and
discrimination, but is more concerned about how much longer this issue will continue.
""There are a number of instances that really stick out, but I think what Asian Americans often feel is just this perpetual and
constant and rhythmic erosion of belonging that takes its toll,"" Kim said. ""I think it worries me and others, not just about
how we get through this moment and are we safe, but where are we heading as a country in this direction.""
What's being done
Experts and advocates agree the rise in Asian American attacks in 2020 became more prevalent after President Donald
Trump began to routinely refer to the COVID-19 pandemic as the ""China virus.""
In January, President Joe Biden issued an executive order condemning the recent attacks against Asian Americans — and
without naming them, criticized former federal officials who repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as the ""China virus"" or the
""Kung Flu."" Many believe he was criticizing Trump and members of his administration.
The order calls for better data collection about hateful incidents, along with mandating federal agencies to fight ""racism,
xenophobia, and intolerance"" directed at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
""The federal government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments through the
actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic location of its origin,"" Biden
said in his order. ""Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and
Pacific Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment and hate crimes against AAPI persons.""
Experts and advocates agree addressing the root cause of the harassment and violence requires more education, more
awareness of racism — not just focusing on one community but for all — and building political power for all minorities.Last March, a roundtable was hosted by New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, Gov. Phil Murphy, Kim and other high-
ranking officials to discuss bias and hate crimes amid the shooting in Atlanta and attacks surfacing across the country.The Asian American Alliance in South Jersey will be hosting several marches and rallies in the coming weeks to raise
awareness, share stories and help others understand the violence and discrimination is not just happening in the cities, but
also in the suburbs.
In North Jersey, hundreds of Asian Americans recently took to populated streets to spread awareness of hate against
Asians, shedding cultural norms. Similar to the marches and rallies held by other activists this past year, protestors were
seen carrying posters and signs that read ""Stop Asian Hate"" and ""Hate is a Virus.""
Last Thursday, the Senate passed with overwhelming bipartisan support an anti-hate crime bill, which is known as the
COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, to address the drastic increase of violence and discrimination directed at Asian Americans
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""We cannot let this slip by, we have to seize the moment when people are paying attention to make the kinds of changes
that will outlast the public attention,"" Oliver-Chang said.
""This is the moment when we need to build political power across Asian American communities, so that our communities
know what the states are for our invisibility and if they don't speak up or report on attacks, we risk having this history
repeated on us.""
Here are a few tips you can do to help fight discrimination against Asian Americans:
Report any hate crimes to your local police or send tips to the FBI.
Submit tips to Stop AAPI's Hate's reporting center at www.stopaapihate.org/reportingincident, which has tracked
thousands of incidents across the United States.
You can also go to Asian American Advancing Justice site at www.advancingjustice-aajc.org, where you have the
opportunity to share your experience.

Man Charged in Attack on Asian-American Woman in New York; The 65-year-old victim was walking in Manhattan when she was beaten,"Chapman, Ben; Paul, Deanna",Others,2021-04-01							,"A convicted killer was arraigned Wednesday on multiple counts of assault as a hate crime in connection with an attack on an Asian-American woman in New York City earlier this week. 
Brandon Elliot, 38 years old, told the 65-year-old victim that ""she didn't belong here"" as she walked to a church near Times Square on Monday, and then he kicked her in the chest and stomped on her head and body, said Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Courtney Razner at an arraignment Wednesday evening. 
Ms. Razner called the attack, which was captured on video, a ""heinous, unprovoked hate crime against a 65-year-old Filipino woman."" 
The woman suffered a broken pelvis and was taken to a local hospital, Ms. Razner said. The victim couldn't be reached for comment. 
Mr. Elliot was charged with two counts of second-degree assault as a hate crime and one count of first-degree attempted assault as a hate crime. If convicted, he faces up to 25 years in prison. 
Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Paul McDonnell ordered Mr. Elliot held without bail, as a grand jury considers the case. 
Mr. Elliot didn't enter a plea. An attorney for Mr. Elliot said his client wouldn't testify for a grand jury. 
Mr. Elliot is currently on parole in a case in which he fatally stabbed his mother in front of his 5-year-old sister in 2002, according to Ms. Razner. He was 19 at the time. Mr. Elliot was convicted of second-degree murder, according to the officials and state records, and sentenced to 15 years to life in prison. He was released in 2019, records show. 
""Let me be clear: This brave woman belongs here,"" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said in a statement Wednesday. ""Asian-American New Yorkers belong here. Everyone belongs here. Attacks against Asian-American New Yorkers are attacks against all New Yorkers."" 
Video of the incident showed a security guard watching the attack from the lobby of a luxury apartment building without intervening. The guard has been suspended from his job pending an investigation, the managers of the building said Monday. 
The guard flagged down an NYPD patrol car for help, according to a spokeswoman for Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, which represents the guard. A police official said patrol officers were the first to respond to the victim. 
Officers arrested Mr. Elliot at his West 40th Street residence without incident just before midnight Tuesday, according to NYPD officials. 
The officials said detectives learned of Mr. Elliot's identity from anonymous tips the NYPD received after he was recognized in a video circulated on social media by police. 
Response to Racism 
The attack follows an uptick in hate crimes and violence against Asians across the country, which have been in the spotlight since the shootings in Atlanta-area spas in which eight people, including six women of Asian descent, were killed. 
The suspect in those attacks was charged in March with eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault. According to police officials, the suspect said he targeted the businesses ""for providing an outlet for his addiction to sex,"" but Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Charles Hampton Jr. said on March 18 that investigators were still considering all options, including the possibility the incident was a hate crime. 
New York City last year saw the largest increase in hate crimes against Asians of any U.S. city, according to a study published by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. 
The NYPD recorded 28 hate crimes against Asians for 2020, up from three in 2019. Asians were targeted in 33 such crimes from Jan. 1 through March 28 of this year, up from 11 in the same period in 2020, according to the NYPD. Department officials have said that some of the attacks have been motivated by the false belief that Asians are responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic. 
NYPD officials said the rise in hate crimes against Asians has spurred the department to increase efforts to investigate and prevent such attacks. 
Last year, the NYPD created an Asian hate crime task force, staffed by detectives of Asian descent, to investigate such crimes. As more incidents were reported this year, the NYPD added resources to combat such crimes, including the use of undercover officers as decoys.

"RESTAURATEUR, BAKER BATTLE ANTI-ASIAN SENTIMENT ","Gigler, Dan",Others,2021-04-29,"When she heard that a 65-year-old Filipino immigrant had been attacked in broad daylight on the streets of New York City, Noi Chaisri had had enough. 
The woman fell to the ground as her assailant kicked her repeatedly in the head and said, ""You don't belong here."" Three men idly watched from a nearby luxury apartment building's lobby, and a security guard there closed the door rather than help during the March 29 incident, according to The New York Times. 
Ms. Chaisri made a sign and put it in the windows of her restaurant, Thai Me Up on the South Side. It said: 
""We are not yellow, we are human being 
""We denounce hate and violence in all forms 
""Anti-Asian just f**k off."" 
She knows it's only a sign, but she just couldn't keep it inside any longer. She had to strike back after a year in which anti-Asian sentiment has become an ugly side effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""We should say something, but our culture, and Asian culture, we're not outspoken or vocal,"" Ms. Chaisri explained. ""But this time it's physical - hit that person, kick that person, kill that person. ... It's too much."" 
Too much for someone who embodies the American dream. 
Ms. Chaisri came to Pittsburgh from Bangkok in 1996 to study at Point Park University. She's since become an unofficial cultural ambassador for her culture through her cooking. She opened Thai Me Up in a small East Carson Street storefront in 2002. 
""I think when I first opened there were maybe four Thai restaurants"" in Pittsburgh, she said. Now there are dozens. 
She eventually moved to a larger space on South 23rd Street and opened Sweet Panda Asian Market, a Thai grocery in the space next door. 
""A lot of my customers love the food but don't know what they're eating,"" let alone how to make it, she said. 
So, in 2018 she and chef Piyo Boonyarat began offering cooking classes to share their personal stories and teach about the ingredients, processes and heavy intermingling of Indian and Chinese influences that give Thai food its unique complexity. After a long hiatus because of the pandemic, the classes have resumed; the next one is Sunday. 
""I have a lot of customers that are really cool. They're open-minded and we explain about the food, and I love it,"" she said. 
That's one reality. 
Then there's this one: She's also been harassed numerous times over the years by white and Black Americans and to this day, even in her own restaurant, routinely endures the microaggressions of people who assume she can't speak English or that all Asians are ""Chinese."" The irony isn't lost on her, as most Americans can only speak English. 
""But we never say anything. I think maybe because of our culture - we don't want to have confrontations or exchange words. Most of the time we take the high road. It doesn't mean we surrender to whatever you call us or label us."" 
Since the 1800s, anti-Asian sentiment has crested in periodic waves - during and after World War II, the Vietnam War era and in the 1980s as America's industrial base shrank. 
The attack in New York City came less than two weeks after a mass shooting in greater Atlanta in which eight people were killed, including four Asian women and two Asian men, mostly of Korean descent. There have been scores of high-profile incidents from California to Washington, D.C. The trend has followed the emergence of the COVID-19 virus first in China and was further exacerbated by the incendiary rhetoric of former President Donald Trump. 
""It's been very personally cumulative for me over the past year,"" Jasmin Cho said. ""It's infuriating and so visceral. It's burned into my brain."" 
Ms. Cho creates food to help bridge cultural gaps and to help people heal. The Los Angeles native of Korean descent has lived in Pittsburgh for much of the past 19 years. In 2016, the Squirrel Hill resident created Yummyholic, an online bakery that she uses to elevate awareness on social justice issues. She calls it ""cookie activism."" 
""I use cookies as a medium because it is intentionally disarming and it keeps people's hearts tender,"" she said. 
She's authored a children's book, and her work has been featured on ""CBS This Morning,"" NPR and the Food Network. In 2018, she hosted a TED talk in Pittsburgh about using baking to tell stories of Asian American history. Still based in Pittsburgh, Ms. Cho is now a master's candidate at New York's prestigious Pratt Institute, where she is developing a program that uses baking as therapy for those who have suffered trauma. 
Some of the first cookies she did during the pandemic depicted the exhausted faces of nurses in Wuhan. They are red, raw, swollen and creased from wearing masks and working nonstop. 
""I was really moved, and I felt that necessity to put those faces out there with a message trying to remind folks that the same people you're demonizing are the faces of the people who are working so hard to fight against this,"" Ms. Cho said. 
She's been looking at opening a retail bakery locally, but the events of the past year have given her pause. 
""It's made me hypervigilant,"" she said, fearing that a business owned by an Asian woman might be a target. 
""First I was afraid to go out because of the pandemic, but no mask can hide my Asian features, my black hair and the way that my eyes are shaped. These people who are getting attacked could be my parents. It's been nerve-wracking."" 
She relayed a heartbreaking moment from a recent charity event. 
""A week before the Atlanta shootings, I was doing a cookie workshop with Kidsburgh. It's a family-focused cookie event, and one of the young girls is maybe 7 years old, and she asked me: 'How do you battle with being both Asian and a woman?' And then she kind of shyly said, ""because I'm Asian, too."" 
""That really hit me,"" she said. 
Ms. Chaisri knows from experience how attitudes can change and that it's not always neat. She relayed a story from 1996 when she first came to the U.S. that would be offensive were it not so comical. Someone asked with a straight face if people still used elephants as vehicles in Thailand. 
""I laughed my butt off and asked them, 'Where did you see this?' They said, 'The King and I.' I said, 'That was set in the 19th century."""" 
She also told of an argument with a neighbor when she started her business. 
""She would tell me to go back where I'm from, and she yelled at me with all kinds of words,"" she said. 
The neighbor later apologized and acknowledged she was in the wrong. ""I accept that, no problem."" 
But, she said, this new variant strain of ignorance won't be tolerated at her restaurant. 
""I told my staff, don't give them food and don't take their money. I want to make money, but I'm not going to bow down to this kind of people."" 
She added, sounding every bit an American, ""Forgettaboutit.""

Local Asian American pol: Racism nothing new,"Milian, Jorge",Others,2021-04-02,"""I don't have the answer to solving racism, but more racism is not the solution."" 
Ty Penserga 
Boynton Beach vice mayor 
- 
BOYNTON BEACH Horrific accounts of violence targeting Asian Americans have dominated headlines in recent weeks, but Boynton Beach Vice Mayor Ty Penserga can attest it's not a recent phenomenon. 
Penserga, born in the Philippines and the only elected official in Palm Beach County of Asian descent, said he was ""bullied and picked on"" as a kid for his looks and vividly recalls getting ""jumped"" at JFK Middle School in Riviera Beach by a pair of attackers using made-up words like ""chong"" and ""ching"" while they beat on him. 
Penserga, 32, will be one of the speakers Saturday afternoon at a vigil in Lake Worth Beach's Bryant Park to remember the victims in a surge of attacks against Asian Americans around the country, including in Atlanta where six Asian American women were among eight people killed during a shooting rampage on March 16. 
Asian Americans, Penserga said, are ""seen as the punching bag. We are the ones that nobody is afraid of. We are the ones that don't fight back. That's what I wish would change. People need to know that we will fight back and that we are a political force to be reckoned with."" 
A paucity of established national political leaders have made Asian Americans an easy group to target, Penserga laments. He draws a comparison with Black people and figures like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson ""who organize, bring attention, apply pressure and get people to change"" when social issues affect their community. 
""We don't have that,"" Penserga said. 
Hate crimes against Asian Americans in major U.S. cities jumped by 150 percent in 2020, according to a study by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, which based its numbers on police department statistics. 
That increase took place while overall hate crimes fell by 7 percent, according to the study. 
The situation doesn't seem to have gotten any better in 2021 with a series of high-profile incidents including: 
The shootings at three Altanta-based spas that left eight people dead, including six women of Asian descent. Robert Aaron Long, 21, is facing eight first-degree murder counts but authorities have not filed hate crime charges against him. 
New York City police arrested a man this week for brutally stomping on a 65-year-old Filipino woman in an assault widely viewed on social media. Brandon Elliott, on parole for killing his mother, allegedly told his victim ""you don't belong here"" during the attack. 
In January, an 84-year-old native of Thailand going for a morning walk in his San Francisco neighborhood was pushed from behind by a man galloping at full speed and died from injuries sustained after he hit the pavement. A 19-year-old man has been charged in the case. 
Former President Donald Trump has drawn criticism for inflammatory rhetoric around the COVID-19 epidemic that many, like Penserga, say has led to the burst in racist incidents. 
Trump regularly referred to the coronavirus as the ""kung flu"" or ""Chinese virus."" 
Penserga, a chemistry teacher at Suncoast High School, said that he was recently asked by one of his students why it was wrong to refer to the ""China virus."" 
""What Trump has done is give permission to people to lash out, to make snide comments, to blame Asian Americans for all these problems, and it has only exacerbated the situation,"" said Penserga, who emigrated to the U.S. with his mother when he was 6. ""But it was there long before this."" 
Anti-Aslan bigotry spurred Penserga 
to get into politics 
Despite his own early experience with anti-Asian bigotry, Penserga said he didn't realize the depth of the problem until he was a student at Temple University in Philadelphia. 
The siblings of his Asian friends reported repeated incidents of harassment and physical violence and Penserga was gripped by ""how helpless they felt."" 
That left him with the realization that ""no one was coming to help us, but ourselves,"" moving him to get into politics. 
Penserga said his speech at Saturday's vigil will include the ""complicated fact"" that several of the recent incidents in which Asian Americans were victimized were allegedly perpetrated by Black men. 
Comparisons between Blacks and Asian Americans, who are perceived to be succeeding in America despite their minority status, have long existed in order to divide the races, Penserga said. 
Blacks are told, ""Hey, look at those Asians. They're doing well. Why can't you?"" Penserga said. That breeds resentment and distrust. 
""I don't have the answer to solving racism, but more racism is not the solution,"" Penserga said. 
Saturday's vigil is being sponsored by the Bangladeshi-American Democratic Club and will take place from noon to 3 p.m. at Bryant Park, located at 100 Golfview Road. 
""We need to get back to the soul of this country which is, united we stand,"" said Junaid Akther, the club's president. ""That's the way we should live."" 
Penserga, who was raised in Boynton Beach, said he hasn't been singled out for physical violence since middle school, but has been subjected to more subtle racism, especially since the COVID-19 outbreak. 
At the beginning of the pandemic, Penserga said people ""would just move out of my way"" when he went grocery shopping. He still ""gets looks"" and hears muffled comments from other customers when he enters restaurants. 
""They're uncomfortable that you're there and want you to get up and leave,"" Penserga said. 
""But I'm not getting up and leaving.""

Op-Ed: Hate crimes against Asians are un-American.,"Mercado, Gus",Others,2021-04-11,"America’s long history of hatred and violence against Asians reared its ugly head once again with the recent
tragedy in Atlanta where 8 women, 6 of them Asian were massacred by a racism-motivated young
White man wielding a weapon of war that he had just bought.
The killings marked the dreadful pandemic year as one of intense and misplaced anti-Asian racism in the U.S.
According to an advocacy group “Stop AAPI Hate” there have been more than 3800 incidents involving
reported involving discrimination and violence targeted at Asian people in the past year alone.
Many more had not been reported. A coalition of civil rights groups estimated more than 2,100 incidents.
In Midland, Texas an Asian family including two young children were stabbed at a Sam’s. The assailant was
captured and said he stabbed them because he thought they were spreading Coronavirus. The Asian family
was not even Chinese.
A Filipina nurse tearfully reported that after working 18 hours straight in a hospital’s emergency room, shestopped at a grocery store to buy some essentials and was greeted by a couple of old ladies shouting anti-
Asian slurs. The Filipina nurse is fair-skinned with Chinese facial features.Closer to home, a diminutive 77-year-old Filipina who is a charter board member of the Philippine American
Chamber of Commerce in North Texas was denied service at a local QT grocery store and was given the dirty
look by the clerk who was mumbling racist words.
The feisty senior citizen who is a martial arts aficionada held her ground and was ready for anything untoward.
It was her burly and outspoken
American husband who confronted the clerk and strongly put him in his place.
Meanwhile, a story went viral about a 75-year-old Chinese woman in San Francisco who fought back and sent
her assailant to the hospital.
Stories circulated around New Year 2021, some captured on video, about elderly Filipinos and other Asians
actually being assaulted on San Francisco and New York streets.
A 91-year-old Thai retiree in Oakland was assaulted during his morning walk and killed. A Filipino’s face was
slashed in a subway station. All for no
reason except a mistaken belief that the Chinese brought COVID-19 to the U.S. And it didn’t matter that many
of those assaulted were not even Chinese.
Is this American enough?
It also didn’t matter if the victims of anti-Asian hatred were born and raised in the U.S. and served heroically
in the military. CNN showed 78-year-old Lee Wong, a war veteran and Purple Heart recipient who came to the
U.S. as a child, giving an impassioned speech in a town hall meeting. He tearfully
shared that when people looked at him with accusing eyes, he told them he is an American.
And some would say “You are not American enough, you are not patriotic enough!” So, at the town hall
meeting he took off his shirt and showed everyone the scars that covered his entire body caused by 6 enemy
bullets that pierced his body during the Vietnam War. And he declared: “Is this American enough?” “Is this
patriotic enough?”
Asian Americans do not deserve the xenophobic and bigoted attacks against them that are spiking in America,
falsely attributing to them the origin and meteoric spread of Coronavirus. Asian Americans are also
victims of the pandemic. And hundreds of thousands of Asian American medical professionals and hospital
workers who risk their own lives saving COVID-19 victims are heroes who deserve to be thanked and
congratulated, not hated.
The “Model Silent Minority Community”, discriminated for a century, now lives in fear
There are 575,000 Asian businesses in the U.S. that feel threatened. The scapegoating is
reminiscent of old racist tropes that led to the discrimination of Asian immigrants in the U.S. – from
the quarantining of San Francisco’s Chinatown during the bubonic plague of the 1900s, to the
rounding up of Japanese Americans in internment camps during WWII, to the traditional
discrimination in visa quota allocation against Asians by the U.S. Immigration Service over the
years.
It did not help that historically, hardworking Asians have been the subject of scorn and jealousy as
America’s “silent model minority community” with the highest per capita income and the highest
education level in the U.S. among immigrant groups and the least chances of getting into trouble
with the law.
Asian-Americans are builders, not destroyers
A former President of the United States once said that if Asian American doctors and nurses
(particularly Filipinos, Indians, Chinese and Korean) would leave the country, the entire American
health system will collapse.
Unbeknownst to many mainstream Americans especially the younger generations, Asian Americans
have played a significant role in the building of this country and to its supremacy as the most
economically powerful nation on earth.
Notable Americans of Asian descent have been responsible for the country’s global leadership in
high technology and modern sciences. Among these are the Asian-American CEOs or cofounders of
Fortune 500 companies such as Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Master Card, You Tube, Hotmail,
NVidia, FitBit, Adobe, Pepsico and many others. It was also an Asian American scientist who
discovered the cure for the Ebola virus and is busy at work on potential cure for COVID-19.
Asian Americans are typically soft-spoken and humble to a fault. The many thousands of Asian
medical professionals will never flaunt their own personal sacrifices as front-liners and willing
warriors in the war against the deadly Coronavirus. Asian business and technical professionals
such as
engineers, scientists, architects, accountants, educators and others are low-keyed as they lead the
technology revolution in the country.
They should all be applauded and thanked, instead of being shunned and
mistreated by clueless and ungrateful segments of our society. And it is wrong to curb the
immigration into this country of these skilled and talented professionals. America must continue to
be open to Asian immigration, especially the highly-skilled professionals. America and all of us will
be better for it.",6107
Anti-Asian hate crimes jumped 74% in NJ in 2020,"Chung, Joshua",Others,2021-04-28,"As the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the state and the country last year, the number of anti-Asian bias incidents —
which includes shunning, racial slurs and physical attacks — went up by nearly 75% within the past year, data released by
the New Jersey State Police show.
COVID-19's origin in Wuhan, China, has caused a significant backlash against Asian Americans across the United States for
the past year and New Jersey has seen its fair share of discrimination toward Asian Americans, said U.S. Rep. Andy Kim, an
Asian American Democrat representing New Jersey's 3rd Congressional District.
Experts say the COVID-19 pandemic did not start this new trend of discrimination toward the Asian American community,
but rather gave people an ""excuse"" to target them and highlights the long history of bigotry against them.
""I believe those statistics are being under-reported and that discrimination against Asian Americans in our country existed
far before COVID-19 and it will last after COVID-19,"" Kim said.
Anti-Asian bias reports, which involve Asian or Pacific Islander individuals, jumped 74%, from 39 in 2019 to 68 in 2020
across the state, according to preliminary data compiled from the New Jersey State Police. However, these statistics are
based off what is only reported to police, as experts and officials believe there are more cases that go underreported.
""I am terrified,"" said Nina Gao, president of the Asian American Alliance of South Jersey and a Shanghai native who lives in
Cherry Hill. ""I think a lot of my friends feel the same way, you know, is this safe anymore? Yes, a lot of these attacks you see
happening in the city, but if it doesn't stop, is it going to happen tomorrow or a year down the road in the suburbs?""
Here is a breakdown of reported bias incidents against Asian Americans by county across New Jersey:
Bergen: 14
Burlington: 1
Camden: 2
Essex: 1
Gloucester: 1
Hudson: 4
Mercer: 7
Middlesex: 14
Monmouth: 10
Morris: 1
Passaic: 2
Somerset: 5
Sussex: 1
Union: 3
Warren: 1
Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland, Hunterdon, Ocean, and Salem counties did not see any incidents of bias against Asian
Americans over the past year, according to New Jersey State Police. The report did not specify type of incident by county.
Asian Americans reside in all 21 counties and in every part of the state. There are approximately 960,000 Asian American
residents, or 10% of the total New Jersey population.
The number of reported incidents seem to track by population: In Middlesex County, about 25% of the total county
population is Asian American as of 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Bergen has an Asian population of 16%,
while Hudson, Somerset, Mercer and Monmouth have populations of more than 10%.
Across New Jersey, bias incidents among all groups — not just Asian American and Pacific Islanders — involving aggravated
assault rose by 18% from 2019 to 2020. Incidents involving a tactic of intimidation rose by 7.5%, while terroristic threats
skyrocketed by more than 103% from 32 reports in 2019 to 65 made in 2020.
The State Police report also detailed an increase in incidents targeting Black, Latino and LGBTQ communities, showing that
incidents of harassment and discrimination rose for the second straight year. In 2020, New Jersey recorded 1,441 bias
incidents, which was the highest total ever recorded and a 45% increase from 2019's total.
But nothing stood out more than incidents involving harassment, as New Jersey saw an increase of more than 72% in this
category — 421 in 2019 and then up to 726 incidents in 2020. Additionally, ""other"" forms of bias incidents, which includes
desecration of venerated objects, significantly rose by more than 278%, from 34 to 129 this past year.
For all race groups across New Jersey, simple assaults fell by about 4%, while bias incidents involving destruction, damage or
vandalism to one's property fell by 3.5%, according to the annual report.
Stop Asian American Pacific Islander Hate (Stop AAPI Hate), a nonprofit organization in California, recorded 3,795 incidents
of anti-Asian discrimination across the United States — a 26% increase from the prior year's 2,808 incidents. Some 42% of
the incidents were reported by Chinese Americans.
New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania were all in the top 10 for most reported incidents, the group's data showed.
Between March 19, 2020, through Feb. 28 of this year, shows that more than 500 incidents took place so far.
Below is a breakdown of the top 10 states with highest number of bias incidents against Asian Americans over the past year,
according to Stop AAPI Hate's report:
California: 1,691
New York: 517
Washington: 158
Texas: 103
Pennsylvania: 97
Massachusetts: 96
Illinois: 92
Florida: 59
New Jersey: 59
Maryland: 51
The most common types of discrimination involved harassment and shunning, which made up 68% and 20.5% of the group's
reports.
Physical assault was the third-most common category, making up 11% of the total incidents across the country. A quarter of
the incidents took place on public streets, while a third of the incidents occurred at businesses.
""I think the (COVID-19) pandemic and, the discrimination that we've seen, has been pouring gasoline on the fire over the
last year,"" Kim said. ""It's disturbing and I truly also believe that these numbers do not reflect the totality of what is going
on.""
COVID-19's impact
Asian history experts say the issue of harassment is nothing new for the Asian community, as a majority have dealt with
discrimination for decades. But there have been several high-profile incidents, such as the recent shootings in Atlanta-area
spas on March 16, in which six of the eight victims were Asian women, that have played a large part in highlighting the
issue.
Last March, a New York City man attacked a 65-year-old Asian American woman in broad daylight and hurled anti-Asian
insults at her as she walked down a midtown Manhattan street, according to New York City police.
The woman was later hospitalized with serious injuries after the attacker punched, kicked and stomped on her as staff and
bystanders did not intervene the incident. NYPD called the incident ""a hate crime assault,"" which later prompted a large
outcry amongst the Asian community for justice and change.
Earlier this month, Jonathan Russo, 27, was charged with multiple counts of assault and harassment, both as a hate crime,
in connection with pushing a 64-year-old Asian American woman on a sidewalk and knocking her down in New York,
assaulting a 32-year-old Asian American woman by grabbing her hair, and shoving a 77-year-old Asian American man to the
ground.
Richard Chen, 40, a web producer and a board member for the Asian American Action Fund, said anti-Asian discrimination is
nothing new across the tristate area, saying that even though he would often see people staring at him when the pandemic
first started, he believes many others have had it far worse in years past.
""Discrimination toward (Asians) has always been there, especially in New York,"" said Chen, a resident from Branchburg in
Somerset County. ""Sure, we usually get those typical stares because of where the virus started, but those who have been
harassed or assaulted because of it is completely unacceptable and is likely going to continue to be honest.""
Jennifer Ho, a professor of Asian American studies at University Colorado of Boulder and the director of Humanities and Arts,
said this topic is the story of the moment, and that the pandemic has only given people another reason to attack this
community.
Ho emphasized the recent violent attacks at Asian American seniors and women throughout the first few months of this year,
specifically videos that have surfaced across the mainstream media, has likely led to the increase of reports recorded by the
Stop AAPI Hate nonprofit organization.
""I want to say that with the violence we're seeing now and with all the racism and the videos that came out last year against
African Americans, the reports are increasing because of the national attention it is receiving,"" Ho said. ""Prior to this year,
when was the last time you honestly saw this much attention on racism against Asian Americans?""
Additionally, the report released by the AAPI anti-hate organization also showed that Asian women made up 68% of the total
incidents, compared with men, who made up 29% of all incidents recorded.
In the Stop AAPI Hate report, victims of anti-Asian harassment sent in their stories to the organization, which included one
Filipino American woman reporting that while in a Washington, D.C., metro station with her boyfriend, an unknown man
shouted at her ""Chinese b----,"" then proceeded to cough at the couple and physically threaten them.
It didn't begin with the pandemic
In 1871 in Los Angeles, around 500 white and Hispanic people murdered 19 Chinese residents in the so-called Chinese
massacre — a buildup of a growing anti-Asian culture that played a part in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which banned
the immigration of Chinese laborers. It was the nation's first set of immigration laws to ban individuals based on race.
Japan's bombing on Pearl Harbor in 1941 resulted in the internment of most Japanese Americans across the West Coast to
barracks and camps in remote areas during World War II, with the federal government deeming them a possibly disloyal
security risk. Over 127,000 Japanese Americans were placed in camps in the United States during the war and over 1,800
died in the camps.
Jason Oliver-Chang, a professor at the University of Connecticut whose research focuses on Asian American studies and
American immigration history, said Asian Americans were used as a racial wedge after World War II and the Vietnam War.
""Japanese Americans were used as a racial wedge in the '40s and '50s, as with an American allied victory in World War II,
there was then a need to claim victory at home as well,"" Oliver-Chang said. ""People at this time were arguing to fight
fascism abroad and fascism at home and in some respects, people looked to the recovery of Japanese Americans from the
incarceration experience during World War II, as evidence of the United States overcoming the color line.""
Oliver-Chang said even though the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s played a major step in overcoming the racial barriers
in the United States, Asian American voices still did not receive as much attention.
""I think it helps to explain some of the absence of Asian American voices during these time periods because Asian Americans
were drawing from the harsh treatment and atrocities happening in Japan, Vietnam and in Southeast Asia, to inform others
of their own treatment in the United States,"" Oliver-Chang said.
Congressman Kim, the son of Korean immigrants, said he has also had his fair share of experiences with racism and
discrimination, but is more concerned about how much longer this issue will continue.
""There are a number of instances that really stick out, but I think what Asian Americans often feel is just this perpetual and
constant and rhythmic erosion of belonging that takes its toll,"" Kim said. ""I think it worries me and others, not just about
how we get through this moment and are we safe, but where are we heading as a country in this direction.""
What's being done
Experts and advocates agree the rise in Asian American attacks in 2020 became more prevalent after President Donald
Trump began to routinely refer to the COVID-19 pandemic as the ""China virus.""
In January, President Joe Biden issued an executive order condemning the recent attacks against Asian Americans — and
without naming them, criticized former federal officials who repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as the ""China virus"" or the
""Kung Flu."" Many believe he was criticizing Trump and members of his administration.
The order calls for better data collection about hateful incidents, along with mandating federal agencies to fight ""racism,
xenophobia, and intolerance"" directed at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
""The federal government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments through the
actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic location of its origin,"" Biden
said in his order. ""Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific
Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment and hate crimes against AAPI persons.""
Experts and advocates agree addressing the root cause of the harassment and violence requires more education, more
awareness of racism — not just focusing on one community but for all — and building political power for all minorities.Last March, a roundtable was hosted by New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, Gov. Phil Murphy, Kim and other high-
ranking officials to discuss bias and hate crimes amid the shooting in Atlanta and attacks surfacing across the country.The Asian American Alliance in South Jersey will be hosting several marches and rallies in the coming weeks to raise
awareness, share stories and help others understand the violence and discrimination is not just happening in the cities, but
also in the suburbs.
In North Jersey, hundreds of Asian Americans recently took to populated streets to spread awareness of hate against Asians,
shedding cultural norms. Similar to the marches and rallies held by other activists this past year, protestors were seen
carrying posters and signs that read ""Stop Asian Hate"" and ""Hate is a Virus.""
Last Thursday, the Senate passed with overwhelming bipartisan support an anti-hate crime bill, which is known as the
COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, to address the drastic increase of violence and discrimination directed at Asian Americans during
the COVID-19 pandemic.
""We cannot let this slip by, we have to seize the moment when people are paying attention to make the kinds of changes
that will outlast the public attention,"" Oliver-Chang said. ""This is the moment when we need to build political power across
Asian American communities, so that our communities know what the states are for our invisibility and if they don't speak up
or report on attacks, we risk having this history repeated on us.""

From colonialism to Covid: Viet Thanh Nguyen on the rise of anti-Asian violence,Viet Thanh Nguyen,Others,2021-04-03								,"Anti-Asian racism is on the rise around the world. The Pulitzer-winning author reflects on his own experiences as a Vietnamese American - and the dark history that continues to fuel the current hate 
On 16 March eight people were killed in Atlanta, Georgia, by a 21-year-old white man: all but one were women, and six were Asian. The shootings take their place in a much longer story of anti-Asian violence. The Covid pandemic has given us a particular insight into this phenomenon: verbal and physical assaults against Asians have accelerated in the US over the last year, with involving - and. The majority of the victims have been women. 
Though took place in Asian massage parlours, the shooter has said he of their race. Instead, he claimed to be a sex addict bent on ""removing temptation"". Regardless of his denial - whether it is a lie or self-deception - it is obvious that he targeted these women because they were Asian. ""Racism and sexism intersect,"". This intersection has been a driving force in western attitudes towards Asia and Asian women, who are routinely hypersexualised and objectified in popular culture. 
Ever since Puccini's 1904 opera Madame Butterfly, which inspired the hit 1989 musical Miss Saigon, Asians have been portrayed in romantic terms as self-sacrificing women who prefer white men to Asian men, and who willingly die for the love of white men. A more brutal version of this orientalist fantasy is found in many American movies about the war in Vietnam. Perhaps the most striking example isFull Metal Jacket of 1987. Young US Marines arriving in Vietnam are immediately greeted by a Vietnamese sex worker who sashays before them, saying: ""Me so horny."" That line was turned into a massive hit by 2 Live Crew in 1989, and a generation of Asian American women would be subject to hearing it, along with ""me love you long time"", over and over. 
Underneath the sexual objectification of Asian women lurks something much more threatening, as Kubrick made clear by the end of the movie, when the Marines are picked off by a sniper. When they finally capture the shooter, they discover she is a Vietnamese teenager. The movie condudes with the Marines surrounding her, and though only one of them pulls the trigger, it is clear this is a gang killing. The Asian woman, who began as a sexual temptation, ends as a mortal threat that must be eliminated by young men trained in boot camp to march with their rifles on their shoulders while they clutch at their crotches, : ""This is my rifle, this is my gun, this is for fighting, this is for fun."" 
Kubrick clearly understands that war, in the masculine imagination, is erotic. The novelist Larry Heinemann understood that, too. Reading his novel Close Quarters as a boy, I was shocked by a scene in which American soldiers gang-rape a Vietnamese sex worker whom they only call Claymore Face because of her acne scars. Immediately afterwards, the soldiers go to battle against their Vietnamese enemies. Heinemann wanted to disturb his readers because war, which he experienced as a combat soldier, is disturbing. In Close Quarters, idealistic young men go to war and become monsters. 
The US is a colonising country. The difference is that Americans call their colonialism 'the American Dream' 
My novel The Sympathizer is the story of ""a spy, a sleeper, a spook, a man of two faces"", whose task in 1975 as a communist agent is to flee with the remnants of the South Vietnamese army to the US and undermine efforts to recapture Vietnam. In writing it, I too wanted to question noble fantasies of heroism and war, to show that they are inseparable from cruelty and hatred - to force the reader to see what patriots and politicians too often deny. My aim was to attack an American exceptionalism that pretends that it has nothing to do with European-style colonialism. But the US is a colonising country. The difference is that Americans call their colonialism ""the American Dream"". 
So when it comes to the American fetishisation of the Second Amendment, let's destroy the myth that the right to bear arms is simply about fighting off tyrants real or imagined. As I wrote in The Sympathizer, ""nothing was more American than wielding a gun and committing oneself to die for freedom and independence, unless it was wielding that gun to take away someone else's freedom and independence."" How else to characterise the founding of the US, built on land stolen from Native peoples? 
Bearing arms was crucial for European settlers in their violent colonisation of the so-called New World, and for American settlers as they conquered the west, all the way to California. According to the, American mythology casts white settler violence as ""regenerative”, versus the ""degenerative"" violence of Native peoples, enslaved black people, and their descendants. In this mythology, a black man with a gun is a threat, even if it is only a 12-year-old black boy with a toy gun, as in the case of. A white man with a gun - coloniser, settler, cowboy, soldier, or cop - is a hero. 
My parents and I fled from the war-torn Vietnam depicted by Kubrick and came to the US, where it did not take long for us to encounter guns. My parents opened a Vietnamese grocery store in San Jose, California, in the late 1970s, where they were shot in their store one Christmas Eve. Flesh wounds, fortunately. A few years later, a gunman pushed his way into our house and pointed a gun in all our faces. I remember that the barrel was thin and long. My father and I did as we were told and knelt. My mother saved us all by running past the gunman and into the street, screaming for help.

There is a long history of anti-Asian violence in the US. The positioning of Asian Americans as a model minority since the 60s in other words, as desirable neighbours, classmates, co-workers and sexual partners has masked the latent anti-Asian feeling that has existed in this country as long as there have been Asian immigrants and Asian Americans. 
I write from Los Angeles, where, in 1871, 19 Chinese men were massacred by an armed mob of hundreds. Throughout the American west of the 19th century, Chinese immigrants were targeted for murder, beatings and violent evictions. They had been brought to the US to help build the transcontinental railroad, but when their usefulness was over, newspapers and politicians stoked white working-class fear of Chinese economic competition; the result was violence. This climaxed in the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. This act was prefaced by the 1875 Page Act, which prevented women suspected of low morality from entering the country, the assumption behind it being that all Chinese women were potential sex workers. 
This idea that Chinese women specifically, and Asian women in general, are both sexual temptation and sexual threat, to be used or to be punished, or both, seems directly connected, a century and a half later, to the self-proclaimed impulse that drove the Atlanta gunman to Asian massage parlours. Over that century and a half, with American wars in Asia bringing hundreds of thousands of American servicemen into contact with Asian women, both as sex workers and as brides, ""the Asian woman became an object of hatred, and lust, a thing to loathe, then desire, the distance between yellow peril and yellow fever measured in flashes"", as the journalist. 
Yellow peril and ""yellow fever"" - the fear of an Asian invasion, on the one hand, and the desire for Asian women, on the other - are not exclusively American phenomena. The fusion of these opposites arose through orientalism: as Edward Said argued, British and French colonisers justified their conquest of the east with narratives of oriental inferiority, docility, lust and treachery. Said was mostly thinking about the Middle East and north Africa, of Arabs and Muslims, but these exoticising and eroticising narratives extend to east and south-east Asia. The oriental as Other is a mask that can be slipped on many different people for different reasons. 
Before the pandemic, for example, the Chinese in France already felt that they were being as victims of crime. During the pandemic, Chinese and other Asians have being called bearers of Covid-19, even adopting the hashtag #JeNeSuis PasUnVirus (I'm Not a Virus). The spike in anti-Asian sentiment has been global. ""From the UK to Australia, reports of anti-east and anti-south-east Asian hate crimes have increased in western countries as the pandemic took hold this past year,” reports, including a 96% increase in hate crimes against people of East Asian appearance in the UK between June and September 2020. In Germany, where Vietnamese migrant workers were the subject of racist riots in the 90s, there has been a in anti-Asian sentiment,. There has been harassment, shunning and bullying of, and more of the same in, and, with women being the majority of the victims in the latter two countries. And these are only the reported incidents. 
The pervasiveness of these verbal and physical attacks, triggered in part by Donald Trump and others characterising Covid-19 as the ""China virus"" and the ""Kung flu"", suggests a deep well of anti-Asian racism. When I was a child, a couple of my pre-teen classmates were familiar enough with Asian stereotypes to pull their eyes into slants and ask me if I had carried an AK-47 in the war in Vietnam (I was four years old when it ended). During the 15 months I have spent in France over the years I was called Chinois by both a black woman and a white woman and mocked with a ching-chong accent by teenagers in Provence, which was more times than I had been called ""Chink"" in a lifetime in the US. 
Racism and sexism spin like coins, two-faced. With one spin of the coin, we can be the model minority and the object of 'yellow fever' 
In America, of course, as elsewhere, I was bombarded by long-distance racism in the form of jokes on the radio, cliches in the movies and the fear-mongering of politicians. All of this occurred while Asian Americans were also being portrayed as the ""model minority"" that knew how to study hard, work diligently and keep quiet. The Committed continues the story of the man of two faces as he relocates to the immigrant quarters of Paris in the early 80s. The French people of Vietnamese descent that I spoke to mostly agreed that the French, as a whole, liked them because of these qualities. Almost no one discussed the idea that their acceptability was due not only to who they were, but who they weren't: Arab, Muslim or black, the usual targets of French racism. 
Asian acceptability has always been contingent, whether we are the model minority in the US or the """" in the UK. Racism and sexism spin like coins, two-faced. With one spin of the coin, we can be the model minority and the object of ""yellow fever"". With another spin, we can be the Asian invasion and the yellow peril. The French who colonised Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were just as prone to these fevered fantasies as the Americans. 
... 
The ease with which ""racist love"" can turn to ""racist hate"" for an Asian minority or the Asian colonised is mirrored, in the, in the way that Europe and the US have often looked to Asia as the source of wealth and danger. Take the American attitude towards China. In the 19th century, China was the ultimate goal of American expansionism; now that it is not so much a country to be exploited but a major competitor, the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations have adopted a consistent anti- China stance. 
Positioning China as America's No 1 threat will inevitably. And since many Americans 
- 
and Europeans - cannot tell the difference between Chinese and other Asians, all Asian Americans and Asian Europeans will suffer the consequences. In the US, the most notorious incident of such racist misidentification occurred in 1982 in Detroit, when two white autoworkers beat Vincent Chin to death, mistaking the Chinese American for a Japanese. The autoworkers were upset at Japanese economic competition in the auto industry, a fear stoked by widespread discussion of a trade war with Japan. 
The systemic violence of a US foreign policy designed to kill Asians in large numbers, or threaten to kill them, from the Philippines to Japan, from Korea to Vietnam, from Laos to Cambodia, reinforces the domestic, everyday racism and sexism with which many Asian Americans are familiar. The acceptability of microaggressions, racist jokes, casual sexual fetishisation lays the groundwork for an explosion of racist and sexist violence that can be literally murderous. 
Calls to stop anti-Asian hate will have limited impact without an awareness of the enduring history of anti-Asian violence carried out in American wars in Asia and European colonisation. The French navy in 1946 and killed 6,000 Vietnamese people. I mention the shelling in The Committed: ""The French saw our shared past as a tragic happenstance of history, a romantic love story gone wrong, which was half correct, whereas I saw our past as a crime that they had committed, which was completely correct."" Ironically, many Asians fled or migrated to the very countries that had colonised them or fought wars on their lands. 
Following these paths, the gunman's Asian victims and found varying degrees of success. A few were working class, a couple were on the lower end of the middle class, with only one - Xiaojie Tan - the owner of her own business, Youngs Asian Massage. Of the two other victims, Delaina Ashley Yaun was a customer at Youngs and Paul Andre Michels was its handyman. Youngs is located in a shopping centre called Cherokee Village, named after the Cherokee people that once lived in Georgia. The American military forcibly expelled the Cherokee from Georgia in 1838 and compelled them to migrate west on what became known as the Trail of Tears, or, as the Cherokee called it, the Trail Where They Cried. More than 4,000 perished. 
Yong Ae Yue, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, Soon Chung Park, Daoyou Feng and Xiaojie Tan may or may not have known of this history. But when Asian immigrants and refugees come to claim our share of the American Dream, this history is also what we daim. And sometimes this history claims us.

Nassau tackling anti-Asian hate,"Ferrette, Candice ",Others,2021-04-09,"Nassau County is creating a plan to help prevent anti-Asian and other hate crimes in an effort to address cultural and language needs in vulnerable communities, police Commissioner Patrick Ryder and county legislators said Thursday. 
During a 90-minute Public Safety Committee hearing in Mineola, legislators condemned the spate of recent attacks against people of Asian American Pacific Islander heritage. 
Lawmakers agreed to create a policing plan within the next 30 days to better document incidents of racial bias. 
Nassau police said they have received no reports of physical attacks despite the rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Ryder said in Nassau, there has been an increase in reports of offensive ""off the cuff comments"" made to Asian American residents. 
However, legislators and Farah Mozawalla, executive director of the county's Office of Asian American Affairs, noted fear in the community - particularly among older Asian American women - following the March 29 assault of Vilma Kari, the 65-year-old Filipino American woman who was beaten on her way to church in Manhattan. 
Presiding Officer Richard Nicolello (R-New Hyde Park) said merely because there have been no reported hate crimes against Asian Americans in Nassau, ""that doesn't mean they aren't occurring."" 
Nicolello said, ""Asians are feeling the effects of these hate crimes and it's important that we are proactive with these issues."" 
Nassau County Executive Laura Curran said, ""although there have been no reported hate crimes targeting Asians in Nassau, we must remain vigilant in the face of a horrifying rise of Anti-Asian attacks in our state and country."" 
""I commend the Legislature for treating this matter with the urgency it deserves,"" Curran, a Democrat, said in a statement. 
Several residents testified that as more businesses open up and people begin to emerge from pandemic lockdowns, incidents of anti-Asian rhetoric have become a major problem in Nassau County, though many have gone unreported. 
""I'm born and raised in New York City. I'm a die-hard Yankee fan, but there isn't a day that goes by that I'm not reminded I'm Chinese,"" said Derek Chan of Roslyn. 
Other speakers called on the police department to assign a dedicated investigator to Asian American hate crimes. 
Some also said the state's new discovery law, enacted in 2019, allowing for victim information to be shared with defense counsel leads to underreporting of hate crimes. 
""We need to have someone in the police department who understands the culture"" of Asian American communities, said David Chan of Manhasset. 
Ryder said the department is working with the Office of Asian American Affairs on an outreach program to make sure community members are aware of their rights and the services the county and the police department provide. 
""It's not just a concern for the Asian American community. But it's all communities in Nassau County,"" Ryder said. ""We have a zero tolerance for hate and we have zero tolerance for bias... 
11 
Ryder referred to a 400-page police reform plan the county submitted to the state on April 1, saying the proposal makes building trust in various communities a priority, so residents know ""they can come to us to report these crimes."" 
""We cannot do it alone,"" Ryder said, ""We need to have families involved to move away from the Archie Bunker mentality.""",3399
Chef donates food to fight Asian hate,"Lunsford, Mackensy ",Others,2021-04-06,"""We have to be comfortable being uncomfortable."" 
J. Chong, on speaking out against racist language and behavior 
ASHEVILLE 
- 
What was supposed to be an easy cooking lesson devolved into a display of hate. 
Chef J. Chong didn't flinch when racists invaded her Zoom cooking tutorial to hurl bigoted epithets. It didn't even feel real until she saw the look of horror on her wife's face. 
Chong was broadcasting a cooking lesson via the video conferencing tool Zoom to support the Campaign for Southern Equality. Chong's wife, Danielle Wheeler, who is white, was behind the camera. 
The hateful torrent the video-bombers unleashed on her livestream, from homophobic insults to anti-Asian slurs, flowed freely for all who joined to hear. 
The 20-second incident was punctuated with an insidious lie: ""Coronavirus is here because of you,"" one in the group of invaders yelled at Chong. 
That was in April 2020, and violence against Asian-Americans has only intensified. 
Over the past year, Asian Americans reported the greatest year-over-year increase in serious incidents of online harassment, according to a new survey the Anti- Defamation League shared with USA Today. 
""Asian-American people are still now being blamed for (COVID) to this day, a year into this pandemic,"" Chong, who was born in Canada and moved to Gulfport, Mississippi, on a soccer scholarship. 
Still, Chong said bigotry has always been a part of her life, even when she lived as a child in multicultural Toronto. Her first memory of experiencing racism because of her Chinese heritage was at the age of 5. 
""I experience a lot of microaggressions growing up,"" she said. Those included jokes about Asian people, which a young Chong laughed off. 
""When we're young, we want people to like us, so it's very difficult to tell people not to make Asian jokes,"" she said. 
Chong, now 43, is not sure why those jokes were acceptable then, but the impulse to shrug off the insults remained ingrained in her as an adult. It was on display when her Zoom class was interrupted. 
""At that moment, it didn't even emotionally affect me,"" Chong said. ""I've dealt with it my whole life. Unfortunately, I'm numb and was able to continue and just bounce it 
off."" 
But Chong said the look of terror on her wife's face as she stood in the kitchen the coupletheir safe space 
made it real. Once the numbness wore off, Chong shares said she felt violated. 
A voice for Asian-Americans 
Chong has not been deterred from sharing her love of cooking throughout the pandemic. A former sous chef with Katie Button restaurants, Chong still teaches Cantonese cooking and other techniques with an affable, easy style. 
Her food can be found at a variety of pop-ups, most announced through @jchong_eats on Instagram. Her handmade dumplings are also a hot commodity at local farmers markets. 
On March 20, Chong set up her dumpling stand at the ASAP Farmers Market with a mission: to donate all proceeds to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders Women Lead and NQPIA, the National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance. 
Just days earlier, a white man had systematically gunned down eight people, most of them Asian-American women, in Atlanta-area massage parlors. 
Chong promoted her benefit on social media and gained a few new customers at market that day. Others donated funds through Venmo. 
""It felt good and it was heartwarming to know that people are becoming aware and trying to take a stand,"" said Chong, who raised more than $1,200 that day for the two groups supporting Asian women. 
'Be comfortable being uncomfortable' 
Still, there's more work to be done, and Chong said she'll continue to use her voice to lift up the Asian community and bring awareness to ongoing violence. 
Despite the increased media attention, she said, many in the Asian community continue to feel invisible. 
""I still think there is a large part of the population that does not see us or understand what is happening,"" she said. 
Erin McGrady, co-owner of Authentic Asheville and a Korean-American, said Asian-owned businesses deserve extra attention right now. 
Chinese restaurants have been hit especially hard with prejudice leading to precipitous drops in business. A year ago, in the height of pandemic fear, more than half of the nation's Chinese restaurants closed, some permanently, according to Restaurant Business. 
""Purchase from Asian-owned businesses like J. Chong's,"" McGrady said. ""She did an amazing thing last weekend in donating 100% of her proceeds back to the AAPI community. We can all in turn support her and others in our community."" 
McGrady mentioned El Kimchi food truck, Wild Ginger Noodle Bar, Itto Ramen Bar and Tapas and Lee's One Fortune Farm among her favorite Asian-owned businesses. 
She also recommended business owners take the Don't Ask Your Black Friend webinar by Jefferson Ellison of the Asheville-based Jawbreaking Creative. The course teaches entrepreneurs how to incorporate anti-racism into marketing efforts. 
""It's one of the best ways to start or continue your journey towards being an ally for people of color,"" McGrady said. ""I can't emphasize enough the importance about what is shared in the course."" 
Laura Smith, a South Korea-born chef who moved to Birmingham when she was 5 months old to live with adoptive parents, is the co-owner of Baba Nahm at the Grove Arcade. 
Smith said she did not grow up with racism, but that hasn't prevented her from fuming with anger about the ongoing hate against people of color. 
Most recently, said Smith, she's been watching the murder trial of Derek Chauvin, who knelt for nine minutes on George Floyd's neck. 
Darnella Frazier, who shot the infamous video of Floyd as he gasped for air, told prosecutors she has stayed up some nights ""apologizing and apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and not saving his life."" 
""I don't want to be someone who stands on the sidelines and records,"" said Smith. ""I want to make a difference. Where are we in this day and age, and why do we stand by?"" 
Smith also mentioned the brutal attack on a 65-year-old Asian American woman in broad daylight, in connection with which Brandon Elliot, 38, of New York City, was recently arrested. 
In a surveillance video, staff of the luxury apartment in front of which the assault took place closed the door in front of the grievously injured woman. 
""If you can't act to protect a person of color, at least speak up about it,"" Smith said. 
People, she said, need to be educated about the various forms racism takes and move into accepting that the United States has a real problem. 
""It has not gone away,"" Smith said of racism. ""But it should."" 
Eliminating racism, said Chong, will take more than not being racist; it will require actively working to be anti-racist. 
She said the onus is on bystanders, particularly white people, to step up and use their voices for change. 
""It can't always come from the people who are targeted,"" said Chong. ""It has to come from power, and in the United States white people have a lot of power - it's time for that community to speak up."" 
That means speaking out against racist language and behavior among strangers, family and colleagues, even if it's uncomfortable. 
""We have to be comfortable being uncomfortable,"" Chong said.

United States: NYC Police Official: Mental Illness a Factor in Recent Anti-Asian Attacks,None,Others,2021-04-05,"The new head of a New York City Police Department task force on Asian hate crimes said Friday that a history mental illness is a common factor among the suspects arrested in recent high-profile attacks on Asians in the city. 
NYPD Inspector Tommy Ng was assigned to lead the task force this week following an attack on 65-year-old Asian woman Monday. The attack was caught on security camera video - which went viral on social media - showing the suspect throwing the woman to the ground and stomping on her. 
In an attack the week before, also captured on video, a young Asian man was beaten and choked to unconsciousness on a New York subway. 
In an interview with The Associated Press, Ng said the Asian American community has had a tendency to not report these kinds of crimes. He said he believed that raising awareness of the assaults would help bring people forward. 
He also said the language barrier is always a problem in reporting crimes, and that is why his team has multilingual detectives. 
The New York attacks are part of a national spike in anti-Asian hate crimes across the United States, which have drawn widespread attention and condemnation from celebrities to U.S. President Joe Biden. The surge in violence has been linked to misplaced blame on Asians for the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The NYPD said it had increased patrols in Asian neighborhoods, including using undercover officers to prevent and disrupt attacks. 
But Asian American Federation Deputy Director Joo Han told The Associated Press many people in Asian communities do not trust law enforcement. 
She is spearheading an effort to train a team of volunteer ""safety ambassadors"" to de-escalate racially charged incidents while they are happening. 
New York City has seen 35 hate crimes with Asian victims so far this year, compared with 11 such attacks by the same time last year, according to wire news reports. - VOA

Biden admin incapable of handling domestic and intl. issues: rights activist,None,Others,2021-04-12												,"TEHRAN 
- 
An American human rights activist says the Joe Biden administration is not capable of leading the U.S., describing his policies as dumsily too ideological which enrages the majority of the people. 
""The Biden administration is neither capable of handling domestic or international issues, and his policies and those around him are clumsily too ideological on enraging the majority of the people with prevaricating promises, puerile policies, ineffective half-measures,"" Randy Short tells the Tehran Times. 
Amid hot discussion about the trial of Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on George Floyd's neck, many observers point to challenges that may threaten the future of the country like deep-rooted division in American society. 
During his election campaigns, President Joe Biden pledged to restore American leadership via reversing Trump's policies. However, some pundits are skeptical of Biden's competence to treat American society's chronic wounds. 
""Biden is incapable of leading the United States,"" Short believes. 
Following is the text of the interview: 
Q: How do you see the rise of racist movements in the U.S., especially against Asian-Americans? 
A: I do not see a rise in racist movements in the United States. These groups have always been part and parcel of American life. Scores of millions of Americans primarily white or those that consider themselves to be near-white have had armed hate groups for decades. Regarding Asian Americans, there has been violence and discrimination against various Asian American ethnic groups; however, there are three things that must be kept in mind: (1) millions of Asians are embraced and assimilated as white and they are often very racist against all non-white people; (2) most Asians strive to be as white as possible which means adopting anti-Black and other racist behaviors and practices in addition to their own hatreds of people not in their clan/ethnic group, and (3) too often Asians seeking to be invisible and alien to Blacks or other non-white people or they are involved in illegal activity or are not lawfully in the United States and do not wish to risk being arrested, jailed, or deported. Therefore, for decades few Asians complain to the authorities about incidents of racial intolerance. 
Across the United States, crime rates are soaring, and Asians are experiencing what other Americans are experiencing-a spike in robberies and violent crime. Another issue at hand that is not being addressed Asian businesses have been giving a commanding role in the economic life of Black and Brown communities, and they often function as an element of racist white power and economic exploitation. 
Racism in the media worldwide ignores the murders, assaults, and beatings that Asian Americans mete out to Black people, and as a result, the reporting has made the situation appear as if Black people are simply hurting Asians. This is neither true nor possible. Blacks are highly segregated from Asians all over America. Second, whites kill and assault Asians with more deadly results than anything that could be said of Blacks. Asians are about 7% of the U.S. population and are 1.4% of the reported victims of hate crimes. Blacks are 12.5% of the population and are victims of 60% of the hate crimes. When is an Asian an Asian or an Arab or white? 
Ignorant American whites in particular already have low or no tolerance for non-white people, in general, are easily angered by people different from themselves. People who hate others for no reason at all are predisposed to hate others if a plausible reason or cause is provided. Furthermore, many Americans cannot tell the difference between one group of Far Eastern Asians from another. 
It must be remembered the United States has fought many wars and insurgencies in the Far East and killed millions of Asians either directly or via proxy allies in Indonesia, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, China, the Philippines, Cambodia, and Laos. Many people grew up hearing the derogatory language used to describe Asians as ""chinks"", ""Japs"", ""nips"", ""slants"", ""gooks"", ""sand Niggers"", ""dune coons"", ""Chinaman"", ""camel jockeys"", ""dots"", ""VCs"", and many other names. These are most common among white Americans, but these words and stereotypes have been around for 150 years. There have been anti-Asian riots and massacres in America-all done by whites whom Asians favor over more tolerant Black and Brown Americans. The Civil Rights that Asians enjoy were fought for and earned by Blacks whom they hate, and these same rights were denied to them by whites who they love. The Martinican psychiatrist Frantz Fanon described colonized people who worshipped those that oppressed them as having ""dark skin white mask"". A major solution I would like to suggest to solving the Asian American crisis is for them to stop being either passive or active supporters of white racism. 
Asians have either had a free ride in American life leaving the heavy lifting of the racial cross to the Blacks they loath so much or actively helped make life harder for people who have not bombed them in Asia nor oppressed them in America. The Asian Americans' Stockholm syndrome days are over and they must sober up to the reality that the way that they have conducted their affairs in America, Africa, and Latin America have become toxic. Money spent trying to look white or alter their 
appearance or enter into unhappy marriages to whiten their children have not made them fully accepted as white. Their refusal to stand for justice has a price they are paying today. 
Q: Do you think the Biden administration can address the challenges threatening the U.S.? 
A: No, Biden is incapable of leading the United States. His honeymoon with the press and the left will end before Labor Day this year. Biden is a singular example of how the hatred of Blacks can help a mediocre non-original thinker American politician have a career in high office. He is white, male, mediocre, corrupt, and from one of the old slave-owning families. There is nothing distinguished about Biden's corrupt and bigoted career other than his ability to help keep the Anglo-American version of Apartheid alive by carrying the torch of racial hatred for his deceased Dixiecrat friends by exceeding their oppression of Blacks with his genocidal mass incarceration bill. He is a tool of the banking sector and if these forces wish to loot and destroy the lives of the American people for profit he will dutifully comply. 
Biden lacks the charisma or character to amount to anything without his handlers and managers scripting everything he says or does. Biden's presidency is a crime against all persons suffering from dementia to place them in such a demanding position when they are not certain of whether they are still alive. Biden who struggles to handle a press conference or climb the stairs is not up to the job. Biased media-stoked Trump hatred has made much of the world's public opinion akin to an LSD-addled cargo cult to such a degree someone so deeply flawed as is Biden with his foul temper, innate incompetence, pathological hatred of Blacks, and rapidly declining mental state can effectively perform the difficult job on earth- the presidency of the United States. Biden's Vice-Presidential choice is evidence that he has lost touch with reality and is on a sojourn to Cloud Kookoo Land. 
Q: What are the roots of deep division in American society, especially under Trump's presidency? 
A: The deepest rift in America is the issue of anti-DAFTAA (Descendants of Aboriginal and Forcibly Trafficked African Americans aka Blacks) hatred and systemic oppression. The very concept of White people and Black people is at the foundation of society. Whites are the perennial winners and Blacks are the genetic perennial losers. The whole society is structured around how the Whites maintain order, wealth, and one-sided justice for themselves and deny the same to the Blacks. Most of what people know about America is based on a selective history, and many lies and myths are foundational to the national identity. The first European settlements in North America (on land presently part of the United States) were not started by the English. 
The Spanish had outposts in what is today Florida and South Carolina many decades before the establishment of Jamestown Virginia in 1607. In fact, a Spanish settlement on the PeeDee River in South Carolina was overrun by the Africans and Indians in 1525-nearly 100 years prior to the establishment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1620. Secondly, the racist notion that the so-called American Indians were light-skinned Mongoloid-looking people is fiction that White Supremacists promote to hide the fact that many of the Aboriginal people of the Americas were like the indigenous people all over the world were dark in color-not white. In fact, Cristobal Colon (Christopher Columbus) called the people he first encountered in the Americas Indians because they were very dark in color. 
Many of the people the Europeans encountered in North America misnamed Indians later were misnamed Negroes and later Black after 1912. Any effort to understand America without understanding that 100 years before the Declaration of Independence Bacon's Rebellion (1676-1677) united Whites, Negroes (in the American colonial period the word Negro was inclusive of Africans and Indians), and their mixed children rose in revolt against the ruling English elites in Virginia. Angry rebels set much of Colonial Virginia alight, but Bacon became ill and died during the conflict which was suppressed shortly thereafter. 
The ruling English elites, in an effort to destroy the solidarity and unity between the Africans, Aboriginals, and Europeans, created a color-based Apartheid-like caste system that made all persons classified as White superior free people and rendered Blacks subhuman slaves based on their color and blood. The system of Vita Durante (for life) slavery effectively made all whites and those who could become honorary whites (this is inclusive of Asians, Arabs, Turks, and mixed-race persons of the fair complexion) natural enemies of enslaved Blacks and they were rewarded for helping exploit, surveil, police, punish, kill, and enforcing the unjust order. Since the signing of the Declaration of Independence, racial hatred and racial oppression have always been central to the Anglo-American dominated republic. One of the main causes of the American Revolution was to prevent King George III's government's abolition of slavery and villeinage in the United Kingdom and due to the Crown's making Parliamentary laws binding on its North American colonists. 
Therefore, America was established in part to preserve the enslavement of Black people which was the primary wealth of wealthy Americans. Furthermore, the greatest threat to the American patriots winning their War for Independence against the British (1775-1783) was the threat of enslaved Blacks fighting for the English King. Royal Governor Lord Dunmore offered Blacks enslaved freedom if they fought to the Crown, and the American Patriots made no similar offer. As a result for every Black who joined the American revolutionists, another 5 fought for the British Army. Likewise, the British helped over 50,000 Blacks flee the United States to various parts of the British Empire, wherein they deprived the richest rebel patriots of their chattel property. Few people are aware that the War of 1812 was fought in part by the richest Americans trying to compel the British to return stolen slaves. The greatest defeat of the United States Army at the gates of Washington in 1813 was inflicted on the ex- slaves given their freedom in exchange for military service. 
African-Indian people fought the United States from the early 1800s to the 1850s. These so-called Seminole Wars (also called Negro and Ibo Wars by the United States Congress) bankrupted the early American Republic and cost more lives than any war until the Civil War. Slave revolts kept the Southern States on edge, and the entire American economic system was wholly dependent on the labor of enslaved Black people-by the 1860s 60% of the U.S. economy based on cotton alone. The United States Government Constitution was delayed in ratification in part of the issue of ending the importation of Black people. 
Black oppression was central to American life for example the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 (which limited the expansion of slavery), the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, Banning of African Importation in 1808, The formation of the American Colonization Society (the U.S. government agency created in 1816 to repatriate Blacks to Africa), the Missouri Compromise 1820 (which limited the expansion of slavery), The Nat Turner Revolt of 1831, The Lone Star Revolution 1835-1836 (Americans fought to preserve Black slavery, the Texas Annexation (1845), Jacksonian Racial Riots (two decades of urban anti-Black riots in Northern states from 1820-1845), the Mexican American War (1846-1848) was influenced by the desire to expand slavery, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, Bleeding Kansas 1854-1856 (mass violence over slavery in Kansas-Nebraska Territory) and John Brown's Raid on the Federal Arsenal at Harper's Ferry in 1859 all were important national events early United States history-all either wholly or significantly influenced by the institution of slavery. 
Finally, the most bloody and destructive war and most brutal domestic conflicts in American history the Civil War (1860-1865) and the Reconstruction era (1865-1877) were caused by efforts to preserve slavery and to reinstitute Black slavery under another guise. Over the entire course 20th century, American life has been punctuated by communal racial violence, racial pogroms, lynching, racial terror, race riots, ethnic cleansing, police murder, peonage, segregation, convict lease slavery, unjust executions under the color of law, non-consensual human experimentation, eugenics, and countless other atrocities primarily and typically inflicted upon Blacks in most of the United States, and no other ethnic group has suffered as much or as often. 
Racial hatred and ethnic divisions have always been a means to maintain power by the elite, and healing these would unite the people and could bring about a major social change. Lest we forget Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, Dr. Martin L. King, Jr., and Senator Robert Kennedy were assassinated in 1963, 1965, and 1968 for trying to unite all the American people. The Black Panthers were exterminated for trying to unite the people. There exist agencies and forces in the intelligence community that keeps the people down. Starting in 1917, the United States government began targeting outspoken activists who were deemed dangerous. The Palmer Raids/Red Scare Summer (1919), CointelPro 1956-1973 And the activities of ""Black Desks"", ""Red Squads"", and elements of the American intelligence agencies have worked to divide and destroy dissent. 
Donald Trump's presidency did not divide the nation. Rather Trump's tenure in office allowed the world and Americans to see the fissures in society that have been in existence since the European settlers first arrived on these shores. In reality, Trump's refusal to hide or obscure real social issues helped empower activists who are 
often ignored and dismissed for a want of undeniable evidence of systemic and structural racism and injustice. 
Trump as a President did not harm Black Americans, and his policies did not target law-abiding and legal residents or citizens of the United States. On the other hand, the racism and divisions in America are useful to the ruling classes who play on these problems to increase their power. Unity is not of interest to an elite who extracts its wealth and power from division and hatred. Biden and Harris are both persons who deeply hate poor people in general and Blacks in particular, and their roads to power were based on identity politics that thrive on conflict and racial fault lines. The Biden administration given his 50-year record of persecuting Blacks (best seen with refusal to continue the criminal justice reform policies of Trump and maniacal belief that Blacks are at war against Asians and his worship of mass incarceration policies), his total slave-like obedience to the COVID-19 mandated fascism over American life, his nonsensical immigration policies and tolerance for human trafficking, and his deviant sexual obsession with offending the religious and moral sentiments of scores of millions of Americans promoting transgenderism and genital mutilation of minors preclude his being able to unite America in anything but bloodshed and chaos. 
Q: Given the U.S. performance under the Trump presidency, do you think the country can present a successful model of governance to the world? 
I have no faith in the present administration of President Joseph R. Biden or his Vice President Kamala Harris Emhoff because both are corrupt and insincere blindly devoted to the bankers, militarists, and the globalists in general. The complete and shameful failure of the Biden-Harris removes unwanted invading American forces from Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and ends the wars in West Papua, Libya, Yemen, and the low-intensity conflicts on the African continent (Mozambique, Congo, Niger, Mali, and Nigeria). The Biden-Harris administration is destabilizing Central America by encouraging the flow of drugs, human sexual trafficking of children and post-pubescent youth, and continuing trade policies that destroy the economic base of primarily agrarian societies. Biden, aiming to mask his corruption having used his former office as Vice President to facilitate influence peddling to illegally enrich himself and his immediate family, has feigned being tough on the Peoples' Republic of China which has given untold millions of dollars to the President's family. Further, Biden has hypocritically denounced the Chinese mass incarceration of its restive Uyghur minority but has defined his political career repressing Black Americans for a half-century. 
Biden is the architect of the most draconian laws on the earth that racially targeted millions of Black Americans to be gulag and warehoused in prisons that renewed constitutionally sanction slavery for Black Americans. Biden's disdain for China's human rights challenges appears to be the projections of a pathological liar, careerist racist, an unhinged corrupt sociopath berefts of his mental faculties and common-sense morality. Biden's bizarre obsession with homosexuality has prompted him to threaten loyal ally nations to forgo their religious beliefs and age-old creeds to appease his quack-science belief in transgenderism and non-binary sexuality. 
In a world fighting to recover its economic moorings, Biden appears to be more preoccupied with imposing debased and immoral degeneracy and psychotic realpolitik than pioneering a genuine international policy that is attuned to the political realities of today. Biden's deliberate and premeditated attack on Syria and the continuance of the counterproductive and failed sanctions regime against the Islamic Republic of Iran manifest the maladroit and moribund foreign policy thrust of his administration. Whereas Biden has gained some international respect for returning to the United States to various treaties relating to global warming and trade, his decisions insult the highly popular ""America First Agenda"" of former President Donald J. Trump. Furthermore, the notion of Biden's providing a successful model to the world is sure to be tested as the restive and angry American public is being held captive to his ineffective and fraudulent COVID-19 ""pandemic"" program that is ignoring the serious social issues faced by 330 million Americans. 
The Biden administration is neither capable of handling domestic or international issues, and his policies and those around him are clumsily too ideological on enraging the majority of the people with prevaricating promises, puerile policies, ineffective half-measures (i.e. student loan forgiveness waffling), continuance policies aimed to harm Black Americans, amnesty and/or at-will immigration, gun-seizure, tolerance of the assaults on First Amendment Freedoms (speech and assembly), and attacks on religious freedoms and culturally insensitive policy thrust (i.e. the transsexual agenda) threaten to incite mass social disturbances that will far exceed the scale and scope of the George Floyd riots. Biden will be no more able to be a respected global leader than was President Lyndon B. Johnson was during the ""Long Hot Summer"" racial riots of 1963 to 1968 nor George H.W. Bush, Sr. during the Rodney King Riots that swept America in 1992. Biden's health and his leadership are failing, and the whole world knows it, and the world is becoming more multipolar because of failed, corrupt, indecent, and ersatz leadership demonstrated by a succession of American presidents that are tragicomic versus genuine powerful men with vision and purpose. 
Q: What are the main rulers in America? Capitalists or lobbyists? 
A: The controlling interests that rule the United States of America is an inbred coalition of old established Anglo-European Banking families that can trace their lineage to royal or noble blood and those who are nouveau riche who have intermarried with the older oligarchical families. The new rich are primarily farrago of ethnys that all aspire to be either honorary White Anglo Saxon Protestant or are Roman Catholic or of the Jewish faith. All the commanding heights of production, important cultural, social, philanthropic, the military and religious institutions, the reins of government, and the purse strings of the public chest are controlled by what famed Sociologist C. Wright Mills called the ""Power Elite"" comprised in the late 20th century the 400 families that controlled America. 
The wealth of the richest 1% of Americans constitutes an oligarchy that is allied with their over class peers who rule the other nations of the world. Elite people are the true power that dominates American life not the ballot box or the officials elected by voters. The lobbies' think tanks, research-advocacy institutions, and other entities all serve international finance capital, the conglomerated mass media, the high-tech industry, the agri-industrial complex, military-industrial complex, the medical- pharmaceutical complex, and hydrocarbon and energy sector. The United States has a hypercritical relationship with reality because it professes itself to be Exceptional, in that; it is devoid of having class/caste stratified society. 
The United States claims that there is an American Dream wherein all people have an equal chance to achieve based on merit and unlimited opportunity, and that ""all men were created equal"" while maintaining a system of slavery and systematic ethnocide of Africans and the Aboriginal people. The foundational wealth that made America was derived from the enslavement and extermination of the African and Aboriginal people and descendants of the chattel slave and wage-slave owners are the rulers of America. Capitalism mixed with racial hatred, rapine materialistic greed, super-exploitation of poor people, atheism, militarism, and Social Darwinistic imperialism is the doctrine of the ruling elite. If the wealthy Americans cared about the welfare of their fellow Americans the trillions of dollars wasted slaughtering people in the Third World since 1945, the United States would be a paradise for all Americans to live decent lives and the world would be a safer and happier place.

United States: Report: Fear of US Hate Crimes Prompts Asians to Reconsider Study Plans,None,Others,2021-04-23,"Spiking anti-Asian violence in the United States has prompted people in Asia to reconsider study plans at US universities and question their confidence in America as a world role model, according to a report. 
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Americans scapegoating China as the source of COVID-19 has targeted random Asian people, including the elderly, hurling racial slurs or even launching violent attacks, which resulted in deadly incidents, USA TODAY reported on Wednesday. 
On March 16, six of the eight people killed in a mass shooting at Atlanta-area spas were Asian women. On April 15, many of the victims in a shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis were Sikh, a religion with origins in India. 
Asian people stated the violence soiled impressions of the United States as racially tolerant society and a top choice for overseas study and research, according to the newspaper. 
""The human toll (from) the recent race-based violence has challenged those previously held beliefs"" among South Koreans that America was a model for good governance and multicultural society, Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul, told the daily 
Japanese national Akiko Horiba, 43, noted that she found Americans to be ""kind"" during her graduate study in Boston from 2001 to 2003, but now she's unsure whether she would come if she had the chance again. 
""I would be a little afraid to visit America because I'm a woman and I saw a video of someone beating Asian ladies, I don't really recommend it to the younger generation,"" Horiba, who works in Tokyo, told the paper. 
The Stop AAPI Hate, a group tracking incidents of violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, received more than 2,808 firsthand accounts of anti-Asian hate from March 2020 through the end of the year. 
The California-based advocacy group tracked 987 in the first two months of 2021, the report quoted the group as saying. - FNA",1971
Anti-Asian violence is a catastrophic threat in US,Your Turn ,Others,2021-04-04								,"The violent killing of eight people, including six Asian women, in Atlanta on March 17 fomented nation-wide mourning and despair amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. There has been a spike of racist attacks against Asian Americans since last spring. According to the national coalition Stop Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders Hate, hate crimes 
reduced by 7% in America's 16 largest cities during the past year, but such crimes targeting Asian Americans rose by nearly 150%. Former President Donald Trump's racist rhetoric toward Asians concerning the coronavirus has fueled the most recent wave of attacks on Asian Americans. 
This recent tragic event is not the first time in American history that Asians have been aggressively and discriminatorily targeted. Notorious historical and contemporary events include the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the Japanese internment camps in the 1940s, the murder of Vincent Chin in Detroit in 198, and the violence against South Asians after the terrorist attacks in September 2001, to name a few. Asian Americans are stereotyped as ""model minorities."" This causes disproportionate stress, pressure and adverse mental health outcomes while simultaneously making AAPIs more vulnerable to discrimination and violence and potentially elevating racial tensions among minority groups. 
Racially-biased violence is toxic for the foundations of society, posting serious threats to social stability, civic engagement, and development. Brutal attacks on Asian Americans are assaults on all Americans. Unprovoked attacks of Asian Americans, particularly on the elderly and women, are cowardly and illegal acts. We cannot remain silent about violence, turn our back on discrimination, or feel that ""racism does not exist"" or say ""it is not my problem"" or say racism is ""no longer a problem in America."" More fundamentally, we have to stop viewing and treating Asian Americans as forever foreigners. Asian Americans have contributed to this nation for more than 150 years. Like other racial and ethnic minority groups, they are an invaluable part of our society. 
As university professors, we have a unique role in facilitating conversations about race and communities in our pedagogy, our research and our service work. We have an obligation to integrate critical conversations on stereotypes and discrimination as part of class curricula. Students need to be able to identify racism in media, news and their own communities so they can become engaged in building collaborative communities and stand firmly against hate crimes. It is important to note that college students are susceptible to being recruited by hate groups. However, students can also become agents for positive social change, justice, and community equity. 
Our work should also be rooted in local efforts to support inclusion and education. Recently, Red Clay Schools indicated that they planned to end the Chinese immersion program at Linden Hill Elementary in Wilmington. Ending programs such as this directly harms efforts to foster a cultural diversity and to engage young children in important language skills. Immersion programs should be prioritized for renewed funding and recruitment because our country is at a critical moment in history. This moment should be seized to stand against hate and to become more diverse and equitable communities. 
We have been fighting the pandemic for over a year, with more than a half-million Americans sadly falling. We must not allow racist violence to take hold and divide our society by causing more racial conflicts and civil disturbances during these difficult times. It is the right time to show our community solidarity and zero-tolerance for hate toward any racial and ethnic group. We call for your support to Asian Americans and communities, condemning racially-based violence and rendering your assistance to those in need. Healthy and strong Asian-American communities undoubtedly benefit the entirety of American society.

Main Street: Asian-Americans Feel the Hate,"McGurn, William",Others,2021-04-06				,"Amid the growing attacks on Asian-Americans, the recent crimes of Brandon Elliot and Robert Aaron Long bear particular attention. The way these two prominent cases are being reported in the press illuminates some of the holes in the new narrative of ""hate."" 
Start with Mr. Elliot's brutal Midtown Manhattan beatdown of a 65-year old Filipina while shouting at her, ""You don't belong here."" Mr. Elliot did this while out on lifetime parole for murdering his mother in 2002. Meanwhile in Atlanta, Robert Aaron Long, a 21-year-old white man, has confessed to gunning down eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at three area massage parlors. 
In the dominant narrative, these attacks are but the latest manifestations of a system built for white supremacy. If Asian-Americans find themselves attacked, the Biden White House explains in a memo, it's because of pols who called Covid-19 names like ""Wuhan flu"" and thus ""stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes."" 
At best this narrative is highly misleading. Messrs. Elliot and Long are living examples why. 
Start with Mr. Long, who told police he shot up those massage parlors to remove sexual temptation. He denied he killed the women because they were Asian. Perhaps evidence to the contrary will appear, but as yet it hasn't. 
That hasn't stopped almost every press report from lumping Atlanta in with all the other attacks deliberately targeting Asian- Americans, or from implying it's somehow Mr. Trump's fault, or both. A classic of the genre was a March 19 New York Times piece about the Atlanta killings under the headline ""Racism and Sexism Shadow Many Interactions for Asian-American Women."" It checked all the boxes: ""racialized misogyny,"" ""the Trump administration repeatedly emphasized China's connection to the Covid-19 pandemic,"" ""capitalism based on racial exploitation"" even while conceding, much further down in the piece, that ""very little is 
known about the motives of the Atlanta gunman."" 
Meanwhile, the woke obsession with race and hate works to diminish both the crime and the specific facts surrounding it. Is the murder of eight innocent people any less heinous if the motivation wasn't race hatred? 
Mr. Elliot's crime is an even tougher fit for the white-supremacy narrative because the 38-year-old attacker is African-American. What makes him particularly embarrassing is that his example raises the larger issue of black-on-Asian crime, which the narrative's champions are desperate to suppress or ignore. 
In a thoughtful March 19 piece for the Weekly Dish on how debilitating this is for news coverage, Andrew Sullivan cites the Justice Department's 2019 Criminal Victimization report to note that ""of those committing violence against Asians, you discover that 24 percent such attacks are committed by whites; 24 percent are committed by fellow Asians, 7 percent by Hispanics; and 27.5 percent by African-Americans."" 
Five days later, a Voice of America article put it this way: ""In New York City, where anti-Asian hate crime soared nearly nine-fold in 2020 over the year before, only two of the 20 people arrested last year in connection with these attacks were white, according to New York Police Department data analyzed by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. Eleven were African Americans, six were white Hispanics and one was a Black Hispanic."" 
Assaults on Asian-Americans cannot easily be squeezed into a progressive narrative of white supremacy. Moreover, criminal attacks on Asian-Americans were going on long before Mr. Trump and Covid-19 arrived on the scene. 
As for the Asian-American community, which is itself highly diverse, it is far from monolithic in its reaction. On one side, there are left- leaning outfits such as Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks hate incidents and appears all-in for the narrative. The outfit is the creation of other groups such as Chinese for Affirmative Action, one of the several Asian-American organizations to endorse Proposition 16, last year's failed ballot initiative to overturn California's ban on race preferences. 
On the other side, there is a growing worry among Asian-Americans about what identity politics and the progressive narrative about race means for them. Last week some of these advocacy groups announced a new coalition, whose first demand is for the Biden Justice Department to reinstate the lawsuit against Yale for using race preferences to discriminate against Asian-American applicants -- another issue progressives would prefer to ignore. Rather than invocations of left-wing abstractions such as critical race theory, what these people want are common-sense protections that will keep them safe and free from discrimination. 
""Asian Americans don't need narratives,"" says Linda Yang, director of Washington Asians for Equality. ""We need the truth. And we need the people who commit these terrible crimes to be condemned, prosecuted and properly identified -- no matter what race they are.""

Police investigating after Asian American woman attacked in Philadelphia,"Deese, Kaelan",Others,2021-04-06	,"Philadelphia police are investigating an attack on a 27-year-old Asian American woman in Center City on Sunday. 
The attack occurred at about 2 p.m. local time Sunday, and surveillance footage captured a man approaching two women walking near 11th and Filbert streets, a local ABC affiliate reported. 
Footage showed the man struck one of the women and walked away from the scene. 
A witness whose surveillance camera caught the moment said he heard an ""eerie scream"" that prompted him to look at his camera. 
SUSPECT DETAINED AFTER ASIAN AMERICAN WOMAN FATALLY STABBED WHILE WALKING DOGS 
An ambulance transported the victim to Jefferson University Hospital, where she's listed in stable condition, officials said. 
Authorities said the attack was random, adding that the attacker was a homeless man and that they did not suspect a racial motivation. An investigation is in progress with the city's Central Detectives Division. 
Buu Ly, owner of Bar-Ly, which is located nearby, told WPVI-TV, ""When you see a grown person hitting a woman, it's just disturbing. It's very disturbing."" 
He added that the incident was upsetting due to the growing trend of anti-Asian attacks across the country. 
Mark Squilla, a Democratic representative of the city's 1st District, said he has received growing reports about the lack of safety in the area. 
""Get our streets back, so people feel safe again because, right now, they do not feel safe because they think the lawlessness is running rampant throughout the city,"" said Squilla. 
A Philadelphia Police Department crime map shows more than 388 crimes have been reported between Lombard Street and Race Street near Center City in the past 30 days. 
Additionally, the rate of annual homicide victims was up 29% on April 5 compared to stats from the same date in 2020. The city reported 499 homicides throughout last year, and victim numbers have been growing annually since 2013. 
Crimes against Asian Americans spiked 150% throughout 2020, coinciding with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.

Youth-led protests in Hing Hay Park and King County against anti-Asian hate start and continue a movement ,"Krieg, Hannah ",Others,2021-04-07,"On Feb. 14, Youtube account ""revealka-rens"" posted a video of woman admitting to calling a man an anti-Asian racial slur after hitting his car with a snowball in Renton, WA. The video, capturing one of the increasingly common instances of Anti-Asian hate, amassed over 100,000 views. It took the mayor of Renton eight days to respond. 
According to youth coordinators at AAPI Coalition Against Hate and Bias, that delayed action from city leadership was the catalyst for the youth-led ""We Are Not Silent"" rally which promises to launch a movement in King County. 
With the first flyers hitting lamp posts just the Monday before, the March 13 rally in Chinatown International District's (CID) Hing Hay Park drew hundreds of protestors to respond to the surge in anti-Asian hate crimes during the pandemic. 
The Seattle Police Department investigated 14 Anti-Asian hate crimes in 2020, a rise from nine in 2019 and six in 2018. King County will spend $5 million to support multicultural media and combat the rise in hate and bias, reports the Seattle Times. 
According to youth coordinator Nathan Duong, the goal of the rally was to ""shift the narrative"" that ""scapegoats Asian Americans"" touted by leaders like former president Donald Trump. 
Duong says he has been ""overly cautious"" in following safety precautions throughout the pandemic. 
""Nobody wants to get the virus, but as an Asian American, it feels like if you get it, you are adding to the stigma,"" Duong said. ""With the fear of getting COVID comes the added fear of discrimination and becoming a victim of hate."" 
The crowd gathered in Hing Hay Park at 3 PM on Saturday, March 13. Duong says the park was full, quick to add ""but not so full that we couldn't social distance."" 
A lineup including Rep. Sharon Tomiko Santos (D-Seattle) and former King County Councilmember Larry Gossett spoke before the protesters began their march through the CID. According to youth coordinator Madeleine Magana, protestors chanted as they marched along 5th Ave, but on King Street, home to most of CID's Asian-owned small businesses, they moved in silence out of respect. 
Duong describes the energy of the event as ""two-sided."" 
""The reason we are there is pain, is fear,"" Duong said. ""But the energy of being there was hopeful, it was electric."" 
The youth coordinators say the event went off without a hitch (Duong giving special ""kudos” to the peacekeepers), but organizing as a young person has its own challenges. 
Youth coordinator and UW student Anson Huang says that the youth team, which consists of six college and high school students, formed ""quite naturally"" through previous involvement and mutual interest. Spread from Maple Valley to Monroe to Seattle, the organizers planned the rally via a hodgepodge of Zoom meetings, phone calls, and text messages. 
The night before the rally, Huang and Magana were on the phone until 3 AM working out the kinks of their script -during the week before finals, no less according to Magana, a student at Seattle University. 
""I kind of put my school work aside, so I'm facing the consequences this week,"" Magana laughed. ""For all of us, this became the priority."" 
Even though the youngest of the organizers is just a junior in high school, this event is none of the six youth coordinators' first ventures in activism - and it won't be there last. 
Duong and his Monroe, WA classmates founded and continue to direct the Monroe Inclusion Collective which works with their school board and local leadership to combat racism and bias. Though he is too young to have seen Gary Locke become the first Chinese American elected governor in United States history, Duong spoke in the same lineup as the former governor at the rally. 
Huang, who is studying both computer science and political science, worked on campaigns for Cynthia Delostinos Johnson's Tukwila City Council bid and Gossett for King County Council. His connection to Gossett helped to score him as a speaker. 
The youngest organizer, Debra Erden-emandakh, founded the Asian Student Union at her high school in Tahoma, WA as well as the non-profit Chosen 1 Family, according to an infographic on the AAPI Organizing Coalition Against Hate and Bias Facebook page. 
Magana, who describes her hometown of Maple Valley as ""predominantly white,"" has been politically active since high school. The rise of anti-Asian hate crimes against elders got her even more involved. 
""Seeing the news of Asian elders being pushed on the streets made me question if my grandparents are safe,"" Magana said. ""Should I take them to Southcenter? Should I take them to Fred Meyer? Should I take them to any public space?"" 
Magana also has organizing experience from helping set up a Black Lives Matter (BLM) protest in Maple Valley. 
The youth organizers do not have to look far for inspiration following a summer of BLM protests, led in many cases by young people like themselves. 
According to Duong, one lesson from the BLM protest is the importance of healing within a community. In addition to covering miles of Seattle city streets, organizers promoting racial equity for Black folks held wellness events for the Black community. On Juneteenth, the CHOP observed a ""Black out."" Organizers at Every Day March, often lead gratitude exercises before their morning protests. 
The Saturday following the anti-Asian hate crime that killed six Asian women in Atlanta, GA, the youth organizers put together a virtual vigil and healing session. 
Another lesson the youth organizers have learned from the BLM protests is momentum. Despite dwindling media attention, Seattle's daily protests for Black lives continued well into the fall. 
After their Hing Hay Park protest, the youth-led movement continued throughout the King County area with action in Maple Valley, Renton, Kent, Newcastle, Bellevue, Burien, and Tukwila all slated before March 22. According to Huang, the turn out of these smaller rallies was still ""solid"" with the support of 30 to 40 community members and even some interest from local leadership. 
The youth coordinators still meet multi-times a week to plan their next action items. Following the week of rallies, Huang hosted a Zoom training session to teach strategies for civic engagement, specifically how to call local representatives and demand they issue proclamations condemning hate. Huang says there is much more in the works. 
""I don't think there's ever any point we should say we are done,"" Magana said. ""As long as there is anti-Asian sentiment, there is always something to stand up for."" ",6557
Anti-Asian Hate Demands A Societal Response,None,Others,2021-04-02,"Horrific attacks against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have prompted marches and rallies nationwide, criminal prosecutions and now a response from the White House. On Tuesday the Biden administration announced the revival of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, new funding for Asian American survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault, and a renewed commitment to improve health outcomes for Pacific Islanders. Importantly, the announcement includes improved Justice Department enforcement, data collection and transparency around hate crimes; information on the federal hate crimes website will now be provided in Chinese, Korean, Tagalog and Vietnamese. 
These steps are certainly welcome, and yet much more will be needed, as the scope of the bias and xenophobia routinely faced by Asian Americans comes into closer view. 
Ten percent of Asian American and Pacific Islander adults have experienced hate crimes or hate incidents this year, according to survey results released Tuesday by Survey Monkey and AAPI Data, a repository of demographic information and policy research. Conducted online March 18-25, the survey also revealed that more than one-quarter of Asian Americans report having been victims of such crimes at some point in their lives. Asian Americans normally report lower levels of hate crimes than Black Americans, but this year the two 
groups are on par. 
The survey also confirmed the microaggressions that Asian Americans routinely face: being asked where they 
are from, with the assumption that they are foreign-born; being encouraged to Americanize or ""whiten"" their names; having their names intentionally mispronounced; and even being spit or coughed upon. That last form of abuse is telling, as the recent wave of attacks has been linked to the xenophobia stirred up by former President Trump early on in the COVID-19 crisis. His use of hate-inducing, finger-pointing language like ""the China virus"" and ""kung flu"" - without bothering to distinguish between the policies of the Chinese government and the innocent lives of Asian Americans, many of whom aren't even of Chinese descent - stirred up this ugly surge. 
But the anti-Asian bias has endured even with Trump gone from Twitter and the White House. In New York City alone this week, footage emerged first of an Asian American man beaten and choked on a subway train, then of a 65-year-old Filipino American churchgoer kicked repeatedly in the head and upper body in front of a residential building, whose staff did nothing. Both episodes are being investigated as hate crimes. 
It is but the latest iteration of a pattern of xenophobia rooted in the American past: the massacres of Chinese 
in Los Angeles in 1871 and Rock Springs, Wyo., in 1885; the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II; the scapegoating of Muslims and South Asians after 9/11. 
This is a pivotal moment for Asian Americans, many of whom only began identifying as such as a result of the civil rights activism of the 1960s. Not since the 1982 killing of Vincent China 27-year-old Chinese American man attacked by two Detroit autoworkers who believed he was Japanese and were enraged about the economic pressures on American carmakers have so many Asian Americans felt outraged and galvanized by hate crimes. Many worry that when the media attention subsides, so will the political urgency around confronting the causes of hate. 
The sad fact is that Asian Americans, no matter their service to or achievements in America, are still too often seen as foreigners who don't fully belong in the United States. Their names, languages and cultures are mocked, and their humanity, distinctiveness and dignity are denied. Violent attacks by complete strangers, and the degradation of being spit or coughed on, are the tragic consequences of a long-standing failure of American society to recognize Asian Americans as individuals, worthy of respect and consideration just like everyone else. 
Beyond what President Biden announced Tuesday, there are many other steps the federal and state governments should consider, including victims' compensation funds, better tracking of anti-Asian crimes, more language resources on 211 and 311 hotlines and improved police-community relations. Perhaps, if the pandemic eases, so will the surge of attacks. But the larger sickness is societal. 
This month, Asian artists were recognized in Oscar nominations like never before, and fuller, richer storytelling about the tremendous diversity of Asian experiences in the United States is long overdue. But until American society more thoroughly confronts and overcomes its long history of anti-Asian hate, the attacks are likely to 
continue.

Political show a distraction from racism: VOICES ,"UBIÑAS, HELEN ",Others,2021-04-11,"THE Kenney administration turned Philadelphia into a national joke when it put a bunch of self-described college kids in charge of our first mass COVID-19 vaccination site. 
But that was just the warm-up act. 
Councilmember Mark Squilla and some 50 Italian American groups have provided a new punchline by suing Mayor Jim Kenney's administration in federal court, accusing it of discriminating against his Italian American constituents and asking the court to declare Italian Americans a protected class. 
Makes sense, given the rise of hate crimes directed at the group lately. Oh, wait, that would be Asian Americans who have been increasingly and violently targeted since the pandemic began. As recently as Tuesday, a 64-year-old man of Asian descent was assaulted in the city's Chinatown neighborhood. This after a 27-year-old Asian woman, on Sunday, was hospitalized after a man walked up to her on a Chinatown sidewalk, hit her in the face, and walked away. 
But who has time for pesky facts when there are Big Lies to reinforce about Columbus being a civil rights activist! Squilla insists some historians believe Columbus was kind to native populations he encountered in the Caribbean. But some historians would be wrong, and all actual civil rights activists are rolling in their graves. To agree with Squilla & Co. is to ignore documented atrocities of looting, murder, and slavery. (I promise there are better Italians to pledge your undying love and devotion. Google them.) 
If this were a few days earlier, I would have bet money it was a lame April Fools' joke. 
But nope, they unfurled one ridiculous grievance after another, including that should they win, they want the city that would be you, my fellow taxpayers - to pay attorneys' fees for the plaintiffs. 
So, let's see what we'd be paying for, shall we? 
For starters, they want Columbus Day to be reinstated after Kenney had the audacity to acknowledge the institutional racism and marginalization of Black, Indigenous, and other communities of color by renaming the city's holiday Indigenous Peoples' Day, and (adding insult to injury) recognizing the Juneteenth holiday commemorating the emancipation of enslaved people in the United States. 
But where does that leave the poor genocidal colonizer? 
Especially after, as evidence of trumped-up discrimination, they cited the city attempting to remove the Christopher Columbus statue from Marconi Plaza when it became Ground Zero for armed groups accused of assailing protesters and passersby. The lawsuit also brought up the unjust demotion of former First District Capt. Louis Campione after allegations that his officers defended white vigilantes during protests there last spring. There are some damning videos that sure seem to support this, but who are you gonna believe: them oryour lying eyes? 
And then there's the city's perennial racist lightning rod: the statue of the late mayor, police commissioner, and resident police brutality fan boy Frank Rizzo, proponent of racially divisive language and policies his followers consistently insist have been misunderstood, twisted by woke mobs who hate Italians. (I mean, the guy had Black bodyguards, for crying out loud!) 
There's a lot of that ""you got it all wrong ..."" mentality going around these days: Consider the Capitol insurrectionists scrambling to apologize now that they are realizing there might be actual consequences for unleashing the deadly carnage on the country in the name of Donald Trump's Big Lie of a stolen election. 
It would be easy to write off so much of the madness, maybe enjoy a few chuckles at the latest insanity. But remember what happened last time we laughed off a clown? One of the more disturbing parts in the suit against the city is the allegation that it discriminated against Italian Americans by not including South Philadelphia's 19148 zip code in its list of prioritized neighborhoods for coronavirus vaccine distribution. It's one thing to pledge allegiance to white rage by worshiping at the foot of some problematic statues, but slinging this kind of misinformation isn't just irresponsible, it's dangerous. 
The city has been prioritizing vaccine outreach to Black and brown residents because they are disproportionately getting sick and dying from COVID-19. That is a fact. Also afact: 19148 is one of the most vaccinated parts of the city. But again, who cares about (real) systemic racism. 
― 
The truly pathetic thing about Squilla & Co.'s lawsuit is that Kenney and his administration do need to be held to account for a vaccine screw-up the partnership with Philly Fighting COVID and its huckster CEO, who not only had zero qualms botching the rollout of desperately needed vaccine, but also felt emboldened to mock and question Ala Stanford, a physician who founded and runs the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium, a nonprofit that offers testing and vaccination in underserved neighborhoods.

"Asian Americans fastest-growing racial group in US in past 20 years: Their population till 2019 surged by 81%, but recent polls show many face discrimination",Nirmal Ghosh&8205; US,Others,2021-04-14							,"Asian Americans were the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group in the United States from 2000 to 2019, with a population projected to pass 35 million by 2060, the Pew Research Centre has found, based on analysis of US Census Bureau data. 
The Asian population in the US grew 81 per cent during that period, from roughly 10.5 million to a record 18.9 million, according to Pew's analysis. 
Hispanics saw the second-fastest population growth between 2000 and 2019, followed by the native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, at 70 per cent and 61 per cent, respectively. 
The nation's black population also grew during this period, albeit at a slower rate of 20 per cent, Pew said. 
There was virtually no change in the white population. 
The US is getting more diverse. 
Last July, a Brookings Institution analysis of census data showed that America's white population share declined 10 percentage points between 1980 and 2000, and by 2019, nearly 9 more percentage points, to 60.1 per cent. 
By around 2045, white people will themselves be a minority. 
Tension 
Racial anxiety underlies much of the political tension in the US. 
A study of 2016 election voter preferences by academics John Sides of George Washington University, Michael Tesler of the University of California at Irvine, and Lynn Vavreck of the University of California at Los Angeles, concluded that white voters' preference for Mr Donald Trump, who won by a landslide, was strongly related to concerns that minorities were taking jobs away from whites. 
Long-running prejudice against Asians has also erupted anew. 
Pew Research's analysis of the Asian American demographic comes amid a documented rise in incidents of abuse and hate against Asian Americans that prompted condemnation from President Joe Biden last month. 
""Too many Asian Americans have been... attacked, blamed, scapegoated and harassed,"" the President said. 
""Hate and violence often hide in plain sight. And it's often met with silence. 
""That's been true throughout our history, but that has to change - because our silence is complicity. 
""We cannot be complicit. We have to speak out. We have to act."" 
Prejudice 
A separate Pew Research Centre survey conducted early last month 
before the fatal shooting of six Asian women and two other people in the Atlanta area on March 16 
- found that 70 per cent of Americans believe there is discrimination against Asian people. 
And in a survey last June, 31 per cent of Asians reported they had been the subject of slurs or jokes since the Covid-19 outbreak began, and 26 per cent said they had feared someone might threaten or physically attack them because of their race or ethnicity, Pew said. 
""The recent violence against Asian Americans is not a new problem,"" Ms Gloria Lim Steil, a Korean American who lectures in literary and critical studies at the Pratt Institute, told The Straits Times. 
""It's a continuation, albeit a ratcheting up, of such violence going back to the mid-19th century."" 
Although Asian Americans have been part of the fabric of America since the 1850s, their history is barely known to most Americans. 
Ms Steil said: ""Asians are not a monolith. Grouping all Asians together, dismissing the enormous diversity of the Asian diaspora, is part of the problem. 
""Chinese are as different from Koreans and Filipinos as Brits are from French and Ukrainians."" 
She added: ""When the pandemic hit, Trump's rhetoric exacerbated this perpetual prejudice. 
""People started seeing Asian Americans as foreigners and targeted them."" 
Special police squads have been formed in some places to curb attacks on Asians. 
Volunteers are patrolling Chinatowns in California. 
In New York City last week, on an escalator entering Penn Station in the heart of Manhattan, an undercover police officer of Asian descent was verbally abused by 35- year-old Juvian Rodriguez, who said ""go back to China before you end up in the (expletive) graveyard"", and then threatened to stab him in the face. 
Rodriguez was arrested. 
Also in New York City last week, police arrested Joseph Russo, 27, for three separate attacks against Asian Americans, including two women and a 77-year-old man.

Businesses defending themselves against rise in anti-Asian violence; Many Asian Americans feel authorities are not taking threats seriously,"Jan, Tracy",Others,2021-04-01,"To San Antonio restaurateur Mike Nguyen, the threat was clear. Alongside the racist graffiti covering the windows of his ramen shop - ""Kung flu,"" ""Commie,"" ""Ramen noodle flu"" - were these words, spray-painted in red: ""Hope u die."" 
Shock and hurt turned to rage, then fear. After Nguyen reported the vandalism to local law enforcement and the FBI, police agreed to step up drive-by patrols. But he and his employees would be left largely on their own. 
Since the March 14 incident, the threats to Nguyen's life and business have escalated. Last week, someone wrote ""hope it burns down"" on the Instagram account for his restaurant, Noodle Tree. An anonymous man phoned the restaurant, reciting Nguyen's home address with a warning: ""We're coming for you."" 
""The threats are getting more violent, more extreme,"" said Nguyen, 33. 
Asian American entrepreneurs across the country are combating a sharp rise in racist threats and attacks on their businesses that many feel authorities are not taking seriously, even after last week's shooting rampage targeting three Asian spas in Atlanta left eight people dead. 
Amid heightened fears, business owners have begun hiring their own security, buying guns and cutting their hours of operation as well as advertising, among other costly safety measures that limit their profits - and profile - at a time when businesses are already struggling, according to Asian American chambers of commerce and other business organizations. 
Asian-owned restaurants, salons and shops rapidly lost business at the start of the pandemic because of racial stigma, fuelled by U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated references to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" and ""Kung flu."" Now, community leaders warn that the racism targeting these businesses could hamper the country's economic recovery from the coronavirus-induced recession. 
""What happened in Atlanta is a very extreme example of the threat to human life, and folks have got to understand that as we try to emerge from COVID-19 and try to conduct business, there are other threats to contend with,"" said Lamar Heystek, president of the San Francisco-based Asian Inc., a non-profit that works with the U.S. Department of Commerce to develop economic opportunity for Asian Americans and other minorities. ""It doesn't take an economist to see how that could really dampen business activity and an economic recovery in which Asian American Pacific Islander-owned businesses take part."" 
Asian Americans owned more than 10 percent of all U.S. businesses in 2018. These firms earned $863 billion in receipts and employed 5.1 million people, Census Bureau data shows. 
""How is that contribution muted by hate, discrimination and violence?"" Heystek said. ""We need to appreciate the systemic effect of these incidents that range from graffiti all the way up to death."" 
It's not only businesses in urban centres like Chinatowns in San Francisco and New York that have become targets of racial harassment. So have Asian-owned businesses in suburban strip malls and rural America, Heystek said. 
Businesses have been vandalized, robbed and attacked online in racist Yelp reviews. Employees, regardless of their ethnicity, have been blamed for the spread of the coronavirus. 
At Nguyen's two-year-old ramen restaurant, graffiti scrawled on a patio table admonished him to ""Go back 2 China."" He is of Vietnamese and French descent. 
The racist abuse began after he criticized Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's decision in early March to rescind a statewide mask mandate that was in place to stop the spread of the coronavirus. 
With the perpetrators still at large, Nguyen, who is undergoing cancer treatment, said he's never feared more for his life. The threats come daily now, making him so ""paranoid"" that he does not allow people to get within 10 feet. 
He had delayed fully reopening indoor dining because of the lack of police presence - and now must budget $5,700 a month on private security for the four days a week his restaurant is open. He temporarily skipped town. And he reluctantly bought a gun. 
""I am personally against guns, but we had to get one just to protect ourselves now,"" Nguyen said. ""I can understand why a lot of Asian Americans don't want to report these things because of retaliation and lack of protection. Will it take for me to get seriously hurt or die for someone to take these threats seriously?"" The San Antonio Police Department issued a written statement saying that ""officers continue to provide drive-bys to the business. We have additionally contacted others in the area to report any suspicious activity and we will respond accordingly. This case remains actively under investigation and anyone with information is urged to contact police."" 
Among the most vulnerable are retail businesses, restaurants and salons whose storefronts open to public sidewalks. Many store owners have kept their doors wide-open to improve ventilation during the pandemic. Not only have they recently begun shutting their doors, they're locking them and removing cultural signage and decor that could make them easy targets for people looking to terrorize Asian businesses, according to business owners and community leaders.",5225
PH consulate in NY joins calls vs. anti-Asian hate in US,None,Others,2021-04-06,"Manila, April 6 The Philippine Consulate General in New York has joined the Asian community in calling an end to the increasing hate crimes against Asians across the United States, the latest of which was the brutal assault of a 65-year-old Filipina in Manhattan. 
""We take this opportunity to thank the New York Police District and its Asian Hate Crime Task Force for their dedication to their work and their quick action in apprehending Elliot,"" Philippine Consul General Elmer Cato said in a statement read at the rally. 
Cato was referring to Brandon Elliot, a 38-year-old convict out on parole for killing his mother, who was charged with assault and hate crime offenses for kicking and stomping on Filipina Vilma Kari's face while yelling anti-Asian slurs at her last March 29. 
The support was reiterated during a rally organized by the Chinese-American Citizens Alliance of Greater New York outside the Manhattan criminal court on April 5 to demand justice for Kari. 
""Today, Brandon Elliot will appear in this Criminal Court, and to him we say Vilma belongs here, Asians in New York belong here, everyone belongs here,"" Cato said. 
""I can see in Vilma the face of my own mother and other elderly Asian women living in New York, who, due to the recent spate of violence against Asians, would not even want to leave the safety of their homes anymore for fear that they, too, would be violently assaulted,"" he added. 
Aside from Kari, another Filipino immigrant, 61-year-old Noel Quintana got his face slashed after he was attacked with a box cutter while riding the subway on his way to work in Manhattan a few weeks ago. 
""These cases hit close to home, since we, Asians, revere our elders. It is part of our DNA to look after our elderly. This is why Elliot's violent attack on Vilma had been particularly distressing to all of us,"" Cato said. 
""But contrary to what Elliot said, Vilma and the rest of the Asian-American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Community belong here. Our community contributes significantly to the greatness of this city,"" he added. 
There are about 2.4 million AAPI residents in the New York City Metro Area alone, the largest in the US, contributing more than USD6.2 billion in state and local tax revenues, Cato said. 
He added that Filipino nurses continue to man the frontline in the city's fight against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). 
Citing data from the National Nurses United, Cato said 4 percent of nurses in the United States and about 30 percent of the almost 200 registered nurses who died from Covid-19 are Filipinos. 
""Twenty-five percent of Filipinos in New York work in the healthcare industry. It is, thus, ironic for Elliot to insist that Vilma and the AAPI community she belongs to do not belong here,"" he said. 
""As we pray for an end to hate, racism, and discrimination, we urge everyone not to shut their doors to victims of hate crimes like Vilma,"" he added. 
Cato urged all Filipino hate crime victims to get in touch with the PCG as well as immediately report incidents to 911 or the Crime Stoppers hotline of the New York City Police Department.

Four things Congress is doing right now that address racial justice in the U.S.,"Hackett, Ashley",Others,2021-04-16,"The debate over racial justice in America is playing out in Congress as Democrats use their new control of both chambers to push forward proposals to advance racial equity. 
On Sunday, former Brooklyn Center police officer Kim Potter shot and killed Daunte Wright during a traffic stop. Brooklyn Center erupted in protests this week during the already tense environment surrounding the murder trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who killed George Floyd last May. 
""We have a crisis, an epidemic of Black people dying at the hands of law enforcement, this is a terrible issue in Minnesota but it's a national issue,"" Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith told MinnPost. ""We have to look systematically at the criminal justice system and policing."" 
Smith has been outspoken on the issue of race and policing in Minnesota, appearing on national news outlets like Good Morning America to condemn the ""epidemic"" of Black people being killed by law enforcement in Minnesota. 
""This isn't only about criminal justice and policing,"" Smith said. ""It's also about all of the systems that we need to change so that everybody has a fair shot."" 
Against the backdrop of pain and unrest in Minnesota, there are several bills that address racial injustice moving through Congress right now. Democrats on Capitol Hill, boosted by President Joe Biden's day-one emphasis on addressing racial disparities and newly won control of the Senate, however slight, are taking action. Here are four areas where Congress is addressing racial equity: 
The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act 
In the wake of a mass shooting in Georgia that appeared to target Asian women and numerous attacks on Asian Americans since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, lawmakers introduced the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. 
On Wednesday, the Senate voted 92-6 in favor of proceeding to consider the bill. Under the terms of that bill, the Attorney General would be instructed to assign a Department of Justice employee to review COVID-19 related hate crimes, including attacks on people based on the assumption that their race, gender, or sexuality links them to the spread of the virus. 
The six senators who voted against considering the bill were Republicans Josh Hawley of Missouri, Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama. 
Reparations 
The House Judiciary Committee voted to bring a reparations bill in front of the full chamber. Despite this victory for Democrats, the reparations bill labeled H.R. 40 after the Civil War-era unfulfilled promise to give former slaves ""40 acres and a mule"" - faces steep odds of passing into law. 
The legislation would create a federal commission to examine slavery and discrimination in the U.S. from 1619 to present in order to recommend ways the government could offer a formal apology and what types of redress and repair could be offered to descendants of slaves in America, including reparations - payments to people who have been wronged in some way by the U.S. government. 
Now, as the country grapples with systemic racism laid bare by the recent police killing of Daunte Wright and last year of George Floyd, the measure has drawn support from powerful Democrats including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and President Biden. But the bill has faced unified opposition from Republicans and dissent from some Democrats. 
The House Judiciary Committee voted to bring H.R. 40 out of committee Wednesday, a major milestone for the bill that has not been accomplished since the first reparations bill was introduced in 1989. Every Congress since then has considered the legislation, but the bill never made it past a committee vote until Wednesday. 
Minnesota Rep. Michelle Fischbach, a member of the Judiciary Committee, voted against the bill Wednesday. 
D.C. Statehood 
The House Oversight Committee on Wednesday advanced legislation that would make Washington, D.C. the 51st state, giving the 700,000 District residents representation in the House and Senate. 
The District's population has historically been predominantly black, and with the 2017 Census reporting that 47.7% of D.C. residents are Black or African American, if it were to become a state it would be more heavily Black than any state in the country. The American Civil Liberties Union calls D.C. statehood ""a racial justice issue,"" saying that statehood for the District would ""correct an overt act of racial voter suppression with roots in the Reconstruction era."" 
""It's no accident that Washington, D.C. is a majority community of color and yet these folks' voices don't have a vote in Congress, and that is wrong and it needs to be repaired,"" Sen. Smith said. ""Washington, D.C. is roughly the size of two Minnesota Congressional districts, so why would it be fair that Minnesotans in two Congressional districts wouldn't have representation? There's no justification for that."" 
The Oversight Committee passing this bill sets the stage for a vote by the full House for the second year in a row. Statehood for the District is a Democratic priority that will likely clear the House along party lines like it did last year. Though Democrats tout the bill as a way to protect voting rights and promote racial justice, there's a political strategy as well: A city that voted 92% in favor of Biden in the 2020 election will likely be a reliable Democratic vote, giving the party two more Senate seats if the district were to become a state. 
The bill will face an uphill battle in the Senate where it will need 60 votes to pass, and where Republicans aren't likely to be on board. 
New Civil Rights Division head 
Senate Democrats in the Judiciary Committee this week advanced President Biden's nomination for the head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, Kristen Clarke, who if confirmed would be the first Senate-confirmed Black woman leader of the division. 
As head of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Clarke was hit by a barrage of misogynistic and racial insults from Trump supporters after her organization was at the forefront of legal efforts to sue the Trump administration on voting rights, immigration, changes to the U.S. Census and tear-gassing of protesters outside the White House last summer. 
Clarke could face a difficult nomination process moving forward. The nominee faced down criticism from Republican members of the Judiciary Committee, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz telling her, ""As I look at your record, I see the record of someone who has spent a career as a partisan."" 
Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar questioned Clarke during the hearing, asking the nominee about her views on police reform in the context of the recent police killing of Daunte Wright and George Floyd in Minnesota. 
""I've not shied away from working with law enforcement,"" Clarke replied. ""I think that there is a lot of common ground to be forged when it comes to issues of police reform accountability and criminal justice reform generally...I look forward to supporting the work of this body as it continues to wrestle with these issues and find pathways to progressive and healthy reforms.

"In Wake of Georgia Murders, Biden Announces New Actions to Combat Anti-Asian Hate Crimes ","Sohrabji, Sunita ",Others,2021-04-16,"In the wake of the March 16 murders in Georgia, in which six Asian American health spa workers were killed allegedly by 21-year-old gunman Robert Aaron Long, the White House March 30 announced a bold new set of actions aimed at combating anti-Asian American hate crimes. 
""Too many Asian Americans have been walking up and down the streets and worrying, waking up each morning the past year feeling their safety and the safety of their loved ones are at stake,"" said President Joe Biden March 19, following a meeting with AAPI leaders. 
""They've been attacked, blamed, scapegoated, and harassed. They've been verbally assaulted, physically assaulted, killed. The conversation we had today with the AAPI leaders, and that we're hearing all across the country, is that hate and violence often hide in plain sight. And it's often met with silence. That's been true throughout our history, but that has to change - because our silence is complicity. We cannot be complicit. We have to speak out. We have to act,"" said the president. 
When Long was arrested for the murders two hours after the attacks, the suspect told police that the shootings were not racially motivated. He has been charged with eight counts of murder, with the Justice Department facing increased pressure to add hate crime charges. 
Captain Jay Baker, a spokesperson for the Cherokee Sheriff's Office in Georgia, has been criticized for minimizing the murders in Acworth. Long ""understood the gravity of his crime. And he was pretty much fed up, had been kind of at the end of his rope, and yesterday was a really bad day for him, and this is what he did,"" he said. 
A barrage of responses on social media characterized Baker's statements as ""sympathetic"" to the suspect and ""offering up excuses"" for the fatal attacks. 
The Georgia shootings come in the wake of a spate of anti-Asian American hate crimes across the nation. The web portal Stop AAPI Hate has recorded 3,795 hate incidents over the past year, including verbal harassment, shunning, and physical assault. Alarmingly, Asian American elders are largely the targets of physical assault. AAPI leaders attribute the rise in hate crimes to the rhetoric of former President Donald Trump, who called COVID the ""Chinese virus,"" the ""Kung flu,"" and similar racist verbiage. 
Biden's action plan to combat AAPI violence includes a cross-agency initiative in the Justice Department focused on the rise of hate crimes against the AAPI community. The initiative is reinitiating community outreach and engagement programs and addressing gaps in hate crimes reporting. The Justice Department will also address language barriers which make it difficult for the AAPI community to self-report hate crimes. 
The FBI will publish a new interactive hate crime page on its Crime Data Explorer website, which will spotlight reports of anti-Asian hate crimes. The FBI currently gathers data on hate crimes via its Uniform Crime Report. However, reporting by local law enforcement agencies is currently on a voluntary basis. 
Former FBI agent Michael German, currently a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice's Liberty and National Security program, told reporters at a briefing last summer that about 12 percent of hate crimes are reported by local law enforcement agencies, because of push-back from local officials who don't want the data reported. 
""No mayor wants to be the state leader in hate crimes. So when your Police Commissioner comes to you and says: 'Hey, look at these hate crimes we're going to report,' and you're trying to get some multinational company to build a factory, you don't want to be known as the hate crime capital of the world. So there's a lot of good reasons why the police don't report,"" said German. 
Under Biden's new plan, the FBI will begin holding nationwide civil rights training events to promote state and local law enforcement reporting of hate crimes. These new civil rights trainings will feature modules on recognizing and reporting anti-Asian bias. 
The National Science Foundation will fund 100 grants totaling $33 million for research attempting to understand, address, and end bias, discrimination and xenophobia, including against AAPI communities. 
The COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force in the Department of Health and Human Services has established a subcommittee on ""Structural Drivers of Health Inequity and Xenophobia."" 
The initiatives also include funding for Asian American victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. 
Separately, Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland announced March 30 a 30-day expedited review by the Justice Department into how the agency can bolster its efforts to respond to hate crimes and hate incidents and improve data collection of such incidents. 
Damon Hewitt, acting president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said in a press statement: ""These initial steps show that the administration takes seriously the spike in hate crimes directed at the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. We support the administration's efforts and call for additional measures to address the intertwined hatred of racist, sexual, and gender-based violence."" 
APIAVote said in a press statement: ""We are encouraged by the White House's announcement of the additional actions it will take to advance safety, inclusion, and belonging for all AAPI communities. This is a solid start to addressing our concerns and issues."" 
The organization noted that 72 percent of the AAPI community feels there is bias against them. It urged the White House working with Congress to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, introduced by Rep. Grace Meng, D-New York, and the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act sponsored by Rep Don Beyer, D-Virginia.

"SJ Asian Americans express fear, resolve","Trethan, Phaedra ",Others,2021-04-09,"Allison Wang, a Cherry Hill resident since 2007, came to this country because she, like generations of immigrants before her, believed in the American ideal. 
""What made America great is the open and welcoming culture of diversity,"" said Wang, an accounting director with a healthcare company and a mother of two. ""That's why it attracts so many talented and diverse people."" 
But recently, she and other Asian Americans like her have wondered, ""Is this really the country we signed up for?"" 
Recent attacks on Asian Americans, many brought on by hatred and misplaced blame for the COVID-19 pandemic, have created a sense of fear among a diverse community made up of several cultures, nationalities, languages and histories who are all nonetheless often seen as a monolith. 
And the brutal murders of eight people — six of them Asian women - in Atlanta have fueled more fear among Asian Americans in South Jersey, but also a sense of resolve that the time to act to end hate is long overdue. 
During a Zoom meeting arranged by the Asian American Alliance of South Jersey, several people talked about their experiences with discrimination and racism and their fears for their families and themselves. 
They and others also expressed hope that, in the same way that the killing of George Floyd sparked a reckoning over treatment of Black Americans, the Atlanta shootings might also bring recognition, support and action to stop the targeting of Asian Americans. 
Nothing new, but worse than ever 
Edward Wang is a professor of Asian history at Rowan University who has lived in the United States for more than 30 years. A former member of the Cherry Hill Board of Education and a native of Shanghai, China, he said anti-Asian sentiment is nothing new. 
""Looking back in this country's history, Asian Americans have been discriminated against since at least 1882, with the Chinese Exclusion Act,"" he noted. Before 1965's Immigration and Nationality Act, quotas kept most Asians from becoming American citizens. 
But even for those who are citizens, including Asians born in the United States, there is discrimination. 
""We are constantly being asked, 'where did you come from?"""" said Wang. ""People assume that if you are Asian you must be a recent immigrant. It's not very comfortable for us."" 
U.S. Rep. Andy Kim represents New Jersey's Third District and is the son of Korean immigrants. 
""The short answer is yes, I have experienced racist discrimination, and so have members of my family along with many others in South Jersey,"" Kim told the Courier-Post. 
People avoided him, told him they worried he could give them the coronavirus; he had heard from Asian restaurateurs whose businesses were targeted with racist graffiti. 
Rhetoric used by former President Donald Trump, especially his use of terms like ""China virus"" and ""kung flu,"" made things worse, creating a sense of blame as COVID-19 forced lockdowns, and the lockdowns caused the economy to crater. 
""We know that discrimination existed before coronavirus and sadly it will continue after this is over,"" said Kim, a Democrat. ""But this has been gasoline poured over a fire."" 
Kim worries that as tensions escalate with China over issues like trade and human rights, xenophobia, hate and discrimination could escalate as well. 
And many Asian Americans worry not only for themselves, but for their families. 
""All Asian American kids have experienced this kind of discrimination, but the pandemic has raised it to a level that cannot go unnoticed, and must be stopped,"" said Xiufang Chen, a Cherry Hill resident and mother. 
""This is the first time I don't feel safe,"" said Li Li, the principal of Cherry Hill Huaxia Chinese who is originally from Xi'an, China. Some parents she's spoken with, she said, ""don't want to make a big fuss, or want to let it go, but really we shouldn't. We should let our kids know what (behavior) is right and what is wrong."" 
The 'model minority' problem 
Often seen as ""model minority,"" a monolith of hardworking, industrious and entrepreneurial people, Asian Americans are really a diverse race from countries with very distinct cultures, languages, histories and cuisines. 
For example, there are 56 ethnic groups in China and linguists estimate 297 living languages are spoken among the 1.21 billion people in Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Tibet. The Philippines is a nation with more than 7,000 islands and more than 170 ethnic groups, influenced by centuries of migration and conquest from Malaysia, South Asia, Spain, China and the United States. 
""The model minority is a damaging perception, but it's one that lends itself to people thinking they can ignore (Asian Americans), that they are off doing their own thing, that if they don't complain then everything must be going well,"" said Kim. 
Many Asian Americans don't speak up, he acknowledged, ""because they don't think anything will happen or that anyone will care,"" leading to greater feelings of isolation. 
""Many in the Asian community struggle,"" said Chen. ""Sometimes when I think of this tragedy (the Atlanta shootings) I get angry, because did it take this happening for people to realize Asian Americans deserve attention?"" 
""It dodges the real problem we have,"" said Nina Gao, president of the Asian American Alliance of South Jersey and Shanghai native who lives in Cherry Hill. 
""It is a way to wedge us out of the mainstream: You can take care of yourselves, you all live in these Chinatowns. We give you this glorious title, but it keeps us away, it makes us feel very foreign."" 
""We're thought of as self-supporting and people who make a lot of money, and that makes us targets,"" said Wen Gu, a librarian from Cherry Hill. 
""Many Americans don't want to take the time to really leam about us, so they lump us all together,"" said Gao, who is on the faculty of Rutgers University's biomedical and health services department. ""They think we are all the same, we all eat weird food and speak a weird language, that we are not Americans."" 
""People don't notice us because we keep our heads down and we work hard,"" said Doris Zheng, a 21-year-old Rutgers-Camden student. Her family emigrated from a small city in Southeast China more than 20 years ago; her father is a chef and her mother is a home health aide. 
Zheng, vice president of the university's Student Government Association, said she's supportive of Black and brown people's struggles with systemic racism in American. ""But Asian Americans are often hidden, in the dark, and there's this idea that we're smart and work hard and we don't need any help. 
""There's this perception of us as prim and proper and perfect. We seem to be doing fine, but really that's because we are working so damn hard."" 
The model minority idea, she noted, is not only damaging to Asians it also minimizes the very real problems faced by Black and brown Americans, making others think they should overcome obstacles as well as Asians do, without understanding the differences in their histories, and the kinds of racism they encounter: 
Is Atlanta a tipping point? 
Kim pointed to ""this moment of mourning"" for the victims of the Atlanta shootings and initial news of the shootings, which first characterized the shooter's sex addiction as a motive, drawing a strong backlash as an event that brought the problem of anti-Asian hate to light. 
— 
In a February address to the nation to acknowledge the loss of 500,000 Americans to COVID-19, President Joe Biden urged an end to attacks on Asian Americans, Kim noted. The President and Vice President Kamala Harris met with Asian American leaders in Atlanta on March 19. 
""People have told me they finally feel heard and seen,"" said Kim. ""The question now is, is it going to be sustained, even after this tragedy falls out of the spotlight? Is this something durable that can lead to change? Many of us have been calling for that for at least a year."" 
""What bothers me about Atlanta is blaming a hate crime on a sex addiction, which this is clearly not,"" said Gao. ""This was obviously targeting Asian women."" 
Jinwei Cao recalled an incident in June, when apartment residents in Newark, Delaware, found fliers that said ""Kill Chinese virus"" at their doors. 
The incident rattled students at the University of Delaware, where Cao teaches. While she was satisfied with the police and university responses to the fliers, she said ""it was really unacceptable."" 
""The Atlanta shootings, I heard from so many friends and students who felt like this is a breaking point,"" said Gao. 
""It's threatening our very existence in this country."" 
Stepping up and weighing next steps 
Edward Wang said he's been in conference calls with other Asian American groups nationwide. 
There is talk of a national march, like the Black Lives Matter marches that took place in the wake of the George Floyd killing in May. 
He's hoping more attention - from politicians, policymakers, media and will lead to more knowledge of the struggles of Asian Americans, as well as a greater educators appreciation of their many different cultures, histories and contributions.
Asian Americans, like so many other Americans, have stepped up to help in myriad ways during the pandemic. 
""There are so many Asian Americans on the front lines,"" said Kim. ""Like the very large community of Filipino American nurses. Doctors. Small business owners."" 
The Asian American Alliance of South Jersey has organized food giveaways and collected donations for personal protective equipment to hospitals and first responders, its members said. They've delivered meals to local police departments and helped furloughed workers. 
Xiaoping Ma, a physician who lives in Cherry Hill, heard alarming news from her native Wuhan, China, as the virus began to spread there. She recalls being among the first to always wear a face mask, warning others to do the same, and hearing the fear and desperation from friends, family and medical school classmates there. 
She helped organize donation drives through the Chinese American Physicians Association, connected with colleagues in Wuhan as they learned more about how to contain the virus, sharing information and insight all while dealing with her own fear for family members and fellow medical professionals here and in Wuhan. 
― 
Ma, who has been in the United States since 1989 and has been a citizen since the 1990s, said she felt guilty that Wuhan was the place where the virus originated - but angry at the way it was characterized here. 
""When the previous president called it 'the China virus,' the 'Wuhan virus,' it made me so angry, so afraid. How can an American president be so uneducated and say those things? But I tried to stay anchored on my work."" 
""We want people to know we are part of the community,"" said Gao. 
""I see a lot of hope; a lot of people have reached out"" to show support, said Sharon Xiaoyun Hou. She's received support from the University of Pennsylvania, where she works. ""People checked in on me to see if I was OK, and that shows me how most of the people in America really are."" 
Ma said her running group, which includes Black, white, gay, straight and Asian runners, rallied around her. Running and a new Peloton bike have been her primary stress relievers, she said. ""I don't think I've ever run so much as I have the last year."" 
""Although many of us are first generation (immigrants), we are all United States citizens,"" said Li. 
""We love this country and we want it to be better.""

Former prosecutor teams with Hogan to address anti-Asian discrimination,"Barker, Jeff ",Others,2021-04-10												,"Robert Hur, who stepped down as Maryland's top federal prosecutor two months ago, will team with Gov. Larry Hogan to address anti-Asian discrimination that both said their family members have experienced. 
Hur will chair a state work group that will develop strategies and recommendations to combat the rise of crimes against Asian Americans. 
Hogan, joined at a Friday afternoon news conference by Hur and Yumi Hogan, Maryland's first lady, said he hoped the group will produce ""recommendations that we can act on right away that can make a difference."" Its members have not yet been named. 
Hur and Hogan both said they have close family members who have experienced anti-Asian discrimination. 
""I am now concerned for my parents' safety and the safety of other members of my family on the basis of their physical appearance,"" said Hur, who like Yumi Hogan is Korean American. ""And that is a fear that no one should have to have."" 
His parents immigrated to the United States, where he was born. 
""I honestly never really thought I was going to have to be actively concerned for my parents' safety in this country,"" Hur said in an interview. 
He said at the news conference that he believes a number of racist incidents go unreported in immigrant and minority communities. 
""We want to learn more about that, we want to hear views and perspectives, and in the end, I know the governor is eager for us to develop a set of recommendations,"" Hur said. 
Hogan, a second-term Republican, has forcefully spoken out about racism against Asian Americans during the pandemic. Hogan said his wife and the couple's adult children ""have had to contend with some of this throughout their lives."" 
""Our family - our three daughters - are very concerned. Our four grandkids,"" the governor said. ""We'd have a family Zoom with everybody where they were just pouring out, telling all the stories of all the things that have happened to them throughout their lives. Our kids are worried about their mom."" 
Yumi Hogan said discrimination is faced by Korean Americans, Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans and others, and even those whose families have been in the United States for generations, the ""same as all Americans."" 
Anti-Asian hate crime in America's largest cities increased 145% in 2020 compared to 2019, according to the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. 
The first spike occurred in March and April of last year ""amidst a rise in COVID cases and negative stereotyping of Asians relating to the pandemic,"" the center said. 
Hate crimes targeting Asian Americans in Maryland have more than doubled since 2018, the governor said. 
Six women of Asian descent were gunned down in attacks tied to a single suspect last month in Atlanta. The killings stirred fear and anger among Asian American families. 
Women have reported such hate crimes disproportionately compared to men, according to Stop AAPIA Hate, an advocacy group. It said discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders takes various forms, including verbal harassment and workplace treatment, in addition to violence. 
Hogan called Hur ""a strong advocate for justice and for the Asian American community."" 
Hur participated in a webinar last month by the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association on the role government can play to combat attacks on Asian Americans. 
He said Friday that discussions about ""race and racism can be extraordinarily awkward and difficult, but awkward and difficult and honest conversations are the only way to solve big and painful problems in our society."" 
Hur announced in February that he was stepping down as U.S. attorney after nearly three years. He was a 2017 appointee of Republican President Donald Trump. He fought violent crime in Baltimore and led criminal cases against former Democratic Mayor Catherine Pugh and two Democratic state delegates. 
On Monday, Hur, a Montgomery County resident, joined the Washington office of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, where he will focus on crisis management and white- collar defense. He said he will make time to chair the work group without cutting back on his work with the firm.

Our Diversity is Truly America's Strength and the Hateful Reaction to it is Truly America's Weakness,"Washington Informer; Washington, D.C.",Others,2021-04-01							,"Guest Columnist 
The recent murder of eight people in North Georgia, six of them Asian American women, has brought national attention to the increasing violence and hatred suffered by Asian Americans in this country, and to the continuing reality of violence against women. Hate crimes against Asian Americans were up a staggering 150 percent in 2020, with Asian American women twice as likely to be victimized as men. Those targeted are of all ages and all different Asian nationalities. 
The violent attacks are often simply random, as when Xiao Zhen Xie, a 76-year-old grandmother in San Francisco, was punched in the face by a stranger. Children have been bullied and insulted. Asian-owned businesses have been vandalized; homes smeared with hateful graffiti. The immediate cause of the increasing violence can be traced back to Donald Trump labeling the COVID-19 pandemic the ""Kung Flu"" and blaming the Chinese for its spread. Trump's taunts focused the anger of frightened people on Asian Americans, despite the fact that Asian Americans - often front-line essential workers - were disproportionately hit by the disease. 
This comes on top of the resentment 
fueled by the loss of good jobs in America, as rapacious multinationals and foolish policymakers conspired to cripple manufacturing. The recent outbreak of race crimes directed at Asian Americans is the most recent chapter of a long, dismal history in this country, dating back to when Chinese workers were first imported in the 1850s to do dangerous, low-wage jobs in mining and railroad construction. Employers suppressed their wages, stripped them of their rights and stomped out any effort to organize. 
Immediately, fears that the ""Chinese were taking American jobs"" spread wildly. Just as with African Americans, Asian Americans were victimized repeatedly by vigilante violence and official injustice. In 1854, the California Supreme Court in People v. Hall ruled that Asians could not testify against a white person. Hall, who had murdered a Chinese immigrant, walked away without penalty. In 1871, in Los Angeles, a vengeful mob lynched 17 Chinese men. 
No one was ever punished. In 1882, the U.S. Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, a ban on Chinese immigration that was extended for 60 years. In World War II, Japanese Americans were interned in what were essentially concentration camps, a brazen violation of their rights that the Supreme Court, to its shame, ratified. More recently, when refugees from Vietnam began to work in shrimping off the coast of Texas, the local Ku Klux Klan, garbed in their regalia, set their boats on fire. After 9/11, violence against South Asians soared. 
In reality, the 20 million Asian Americans in the United States are very diverse, coming from 20 countries with different languages, religions and races. The largest numbers come from China, India and the Philippines. Collectively, they are the fastest growing minority in the United States. On average, they are remarkably successful. Their median annual wage is higher than that of all Americans. 
They are less likely to live in poverty. Over half of those older than 25 have a college degree or more, compared with 30 percent of all Americans. Seven in 10 who are 5 or older speak English proficiently. Yet, despite this success, they suffer from systemic racism and face a growing threat of violence. Now is the time to confront this plague. The murders in North Georgia have sparked vigils across the country. Civil rights organizations, African American and Latino groups have rallied in solidarity. 
The mainstream media has finally put a spotlight on the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes. The Asian American Leaders Table has called on the federal government to ensure robust enforcement of civil rights laws, and to prioritize violence prevention and restorative justice. Strikingly, they understand that all communities of color struggle in the face of racism and hate crimes. 
They call on Congress to invest in communities at risk, building for all Americans basic economic rights that include jobs, housing, health care and education. The founding vision of the Rainbow Coalition was the inclusive society. We realized when you combine all the marginalized people who suffer from discrimination - African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, members of the LGBTQ communities, undocumented immigrants, the disabled and more - we represent the majority of America. And when workers come together across lines of race and religion, they can change the world. 
The pandemic and the poisonous rhetoric of Donald Trump have exposed once more the hard work that must be done to bring together an inclusive society. Our diversity is truly America's strength, and the hateful reaction to it America's weakness. The rising violence against Asian Americans, the Black Lives Matter marches against police brutality, the tragic epidemic of deaths of despair plaguing displaced working people, the increasing anger at immigrants require all of us to come together, across lines of race and religion and region, to protect one another and to unite in the call for equal justice. Together we can make a more perfect union.

"Media quick to focus on race of suspects in US attacks: Unlike in the US, South Korean media put heavy emphasis on the race of attackers, many of whom were African-American The stark contrast in framing highlights differing sensitivities around race that permeate the two cultures, analysts say","Power, John",Others,2021-04-05													,"When news broke of the latest violent attack against an Asian-American in New York City on Monday, it ricocheted across the South Korean mediasphere, generating countless articles and news bulletins. 
The brutal attack on a 65-year-old Filipino woman, documented in graphic footage, was the latest example of the rising anti-Asian violence in the US that has captured attention in South Korea, where media outlets have highlighted the Korean background of some of those targeted. 
Four of the eight people killed in last month's Atlanta spa shooting - which prompted widespread soul-searching about anti-Asian bias in the US - were women of Korean descent, while two were ethnic Chinese. 
On Thursday, an article about Brandon Elliot - the suspect in Monday's attack - ranked as the most-read piece on the website of Korean broadcaster JTBC. 
Elliot, a 38-year-old homeless man who was previously convicted of killing his mother, has been charged with three federal hate crimes after allegedly kicking and stomping on his victim in front of a luxury housing estate. 
Yet the flurry of attention in South Korea, one of the world's most ethnically homogenous countries, at the uptick in violence has differed from coverage elsewhere in one notable respect: a heavy focus on the race of the suspects involved, many of whom have been African-American. 
While US news reports did not highlight the race of alleged assailants in many recent attacks, South Korean media outlets have readily identified suspects by race in articles and even headlines. 
In one article, the state-funded Yonhap News Agency mentioned Elliot's race and that of another man who was reported to have attacked an Asian man on the New York subway on Monday no fewer than 26 times. Both Elliot and the suspect in the subway incident - which a witness later said appeared to have actually involved a Hispanic man who used a racial slur - are black. 
The stark contrast in framing highlights differing sensitivities around race that permeate the two cultures, amid discussions in the US and elsewhere about the causes of violence against Asians that have thrown up explanations ranging from the Covid-19 pandemic to white supremacy. 
""Race holds different meanings and different power in different countries - it is just more sensitive and less tolerant to point out one's race in the US due to its long and contentious history of racism,"" said Gi-Wook Shin, a Korean-American sociology professor at Stanford University. 
For Koreans, ethnicity is so integral to identity that ""it seems just a natural thing for Korean media to mention race along with other socio-demographic characteristics"", Shin said. 
Michael Hurt, a sociologist of African-American and Korean descent who lives in Seoul, said South Korean society had a history of linking African-Americans with violent crime because of the tensions exposed between black and Korean-American communities in the 1992 Los Angeles riots. 
""Koreans want to know the real deal. Is it safe? And safe in America definitely brings up black faces in the Korean mind,"" Hurt said. ""Do Black people inherently hate Asian people? I don't think that's true, I don't think that's ever been true, but I think there's a perception of that as true in Korea, and how the media has to speak to that is a pretty tricky thing."" US media reports have largely avoided mentioning the race of the alleged assailants in recent attacks. Hurt said he did not believe US media outlets were guilty of hypocrisy in being sensitive in covering the race of perpetrators, but acknowledged the possibility of ""overcorrection"" in some cases. 
""If it's just straightforward white supremacy, white people acting out, that just makes more sense, but I think when you see ... people of colour beating up other people of colour you kind of scratch your head and think I don't really understand what's going on,"" he said. ",3899
Locals wrestle with anti-Asian racism: Greenville resident: 'My very existence is a wake-up call',"Nicholson, Zoe",Others,2021-04-11									,"The xenophobia, or intense fear of outsiders, against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the country reached a fever pitch last month after a slew of hate crimes were reported against Asian Americans across the country, a rise that is linked to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Some in the Upstate hope their stories ones of community and perseverance and hope - will help end the cycle of hate and 
violence. 
And to hear Greenville resident Hao Wu's story is to hear the American Dream. 
Wu was born in China to pro-democracy parents. After his father was blacklisted by the Chinese government for his views, the family spent seven years in hiding from the Communist regime. 
In 1996, they were able to escape to America, where Wu's father secured a job at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, where Wu grew up. 
He went to school at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill and got a job doing biochemical research right out of school. Then, like 9 million other Americans, Wu lost his job during the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009. 
But Wu still wasn't an American. After 13 years in this country, he was still labeled an immigrant. So, he joined the military. 
Wu spent four years as an active-duty combat medic in the U.S. Army. He was deployed overseas twice, once to Iraq, then to Afghanistan. He gained citizenship in 2014 and was honorably discharged from the Army in 2014, he said. 
Wu now calls Greenville home, where he is an ""angel investor"" for several businesses, meaning he funds enterprises, but does not have a say in day-to-day operations. 
""The American Dream has slowly evolved over the hundreds of years that America has existed, you know, I could be that example. My very existence is a wake-up call,"" Wu, 36, said. 
As an activist for the Asian American community in the Upstate, Wu hopes his story will break down the barriers of racism and xenophobia that have plagued the Asian and Asian-American communities for hundreds of years. 
But those barriers have become stronger during the past 15 months with the rise of anti-Asian rhetoric and violence during the coronavirus pandemic, when hate crimes are increasing at an alarming rate, according to nonprofit Stop AAPI Hate. 
Asians have been brutally attacked in San Francisco, New York, and in the Atlanta Spa Shootings, which left eight dead, six of which were Asian Americans. Georgia law enforcement officials say the murderer was not motivated by racism, but many, including Wu, dispute that claim. 
""I believe (the suspect) to be a racist, but also misogynist,"" Wu said in a YouTube video posted to nonprofit Votes for Vets' YouTube 
page. 
Community and exclusion 
The Korea Center of Greenville is housed in a log cabin in Greer, a short drive from Michelin and Top Golf on Pelham Road. Sara Yoon started the center in 2015 after noticing a need for Korean Americans to gather and learn in Greenville. 
The center holds Korean-language classes for children and adults, hosts cultural events and barbecue competitions, and serves as a ""starting point"" for new Korean immigrants when they arrive in the area. 
Yoon said simple tasks like writing a check, or understanding the cultural difference between Americans and Koreans can be overwhelming and confusing. She's there to help them wade through those turbulent waters. 
Yoon came to America as a young adult, spending a lot of her life in New York and Florida before moving to Greenville with her husband... Greenville is where she built a real estate business, created the Korea Center nonprofit, and raised her daughter. This is 
her home. 
But the past year has shown not everyone feels that way. The pandemic has led to a rise in anti-Asian rhetoric and violence. 
""It just sad. And I am feeling betrayed because this is our country. If someone asked me to go home, I have no place to go home,"" she said. ""So it is kind of a sad feeling of betrayal for me as a Korean American who has lived here a lot longer than I have in Korea."" 
And it's not just racism and violence the community is facing, it's unemployment. 
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are also facing undue financial hardship more than other demographics, according to USA Today. Almost half of America's unemployed Asians face long-term joblessness (six months or more), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The figures are worse than those for white, Black, and Hispanic workers, the report found. 
Did COVID lead to a rise in anti-Asian rhetoric? 
The violence and racism Asian Americans are facing is not a new phenomenon. Since they began immigrating to this country in the 19th Century, Asians have been the targets of racist attacks and government action. 
In 1871, a mob murdered 19 Chinese people in Los Angeles, according to Harvard University. The Chinese Exclusion Act - the first piece of U.S. Legislation to restrict immigration based on nationality - was passed four years later and barred Chinese laborers from entering the nation. 
Anti-Asian sentiment flared during World War II and the Vietnam War, leading to a rise in hate crimes and government-sanctioned atrocities, including the imprisonment of thousands of Japanese Americans in internment camps during the 1940s. 
More than a quarter of all Asian Americans have experienced a hate crime during their lives, with 10% of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders saying they were the victim of a racist attack in 2021, according to Stop AAPI Hate, a nonprofit aimed at curbing hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. 
No hate crimes against that demographic have been reported to the State Law Enforcement Division, according to spokesperson Tommy Crosby. But microaggressions - small or subconscious instances of prejudice and racism and verbal attacks are common, according to Wu. 
— 
It comes down to this, Clemson senior Kenneth Sloane said: It's not so much, ""we're better than you... it's more like, 'why are you here?"""" 
Sloane said the pandemic - which originated in China - has allowed people to ""attach certain catchphrases or terms"" to the rhetoric of anti-Asian racism. 
""People don't say it out loud as much, but I think this pandemic has really given people ways to speak on that or act on that kind of bias that they maybe didn't have in the past,"" Sloane, who is white and Japanese, said. 
Rise in violence leads to Upstate activism 
A 15-year-old white teenager from Oconee County is among the dozen or so people banding together to stop the xenophobia in Upstate South Carolina. 
Hayden Laye, a high school student from Walhalla, created Stop Asian Hate Upstate SC with about a dozen other activists to promote awareness to the rise in racism and work to end the anti-Asian rhetoric in local communities. 
""We don't have a lot of Asian people in Oconee County or in the Upstate, but it's just that, even if you don't see it, we know what's going on,"" Laye said. Oconee County's population is less than 1% Asian and the state has an Asian American population of 1.8%, according to the U.S. Census. 
""And we need to help people where it is happening, or even if it's just happening online or to those few people in Oconee County,"" Laye added. 
Stop Asian Hate Upstate SC is planning to hold rallies across the Upstate in the coming weeks, Laye said. One is tentatively planned for downtown Greenville on April 24. 
The group is a mix of Democrats, Black Lives Matter and Dreamer activists, Laye said. Wu, the Chinese veteran, is also tied to the 
group. 
""It's people from all across the Upstate coming together and across the country to work to end racism."" 
Although the group is run by many non-Asians, Wu said he hopes that by putting his story out there, it spurs dialogues and helps other Asian Americans speak out. 
""In the past, we as Asian Americans were more likely to just lower our heads and then try to do our hard work to prove ourselves. But right now, I do believe that we need to do both, we need to continue to do hard work and also put our stories out there."" ",8021
Race-Baiting and Mass Murders,"Sohoni, Neera Kuckreja ",Others,2021-04-02,"On Jan. 26, 2021, President Joe Biden issued a memorandum stating that ""Advancing inclusion and belonging for people of all races, national origins, and ethnicities is critical to guaranteeing the safety and security of the American people. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, inflammatory and xenophobic rhetoric has put Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) persons, families, communities, and businesses at risk."" 
Indicting the Trump administration, the memo continued, ""The Federal Government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments through the actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic location of its origin. Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI persons."" 
Biden called on the federal government to combat racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against AAPI and to ensure that all members of AAPI communities - no matter their background, the language they speak, or their religious beliefs - are treated with dignity and equity. 
Acts of intolerance against AAPI, or for that matter, any other race, are neither unusual nor specific to America. Colonialism, slavery, genocide, and caste/class systems have soiled the legacy of all nations and societies. The burden on us collectively as humanity is to work harder to eliminate the incidence and intensity of such ethno- centric exclusion, discrimination, devaluation, endangerment and extinction. But remedies that begin and end with renaming an epidemic from Wuhan or China to Covid remain cosmetic. Societies don't suddenly erupt into or embrace racism because of a singular occurrence of a pandemic. 
We are racists principally because we are different, and regardless of what religious and political preachers prescribe, we continue to define ourselves in relation to ""others."" Crimes against Asian Americans (AA), like crimes against other peoples and races, are embedded in the vaults of history. But so are crimes by AAs against each other or in other centuries and places, against religious and ethnic groups from other regions of 
the world. 
A recent item circulating in social media regrets the targeting of AA in American cities but also notes how mutual hatred is the common thread of global sociology and history: The Chinese hate Japanese, Koreans hate Japanese, Laotians hate Vietnamese, Thais hate Burmese, Burmese hate Indians, Indians hate Pakistanis, Bangladeshis hate Pakistanis and Indians, and so on. Such mutually mistrusting and hating nations are the reality also of Europe, Latin America, Middle East and Africa. The unifying factor is that all the above hate America! As China expects to replace America as the world's leading power, China inevitably will replace the U.S. as the most hated global power. 
To lump all people from Asia and Pacific as AAPI, or all Latin Americans as Hispanics, overlooks these intrinsic divides among them, and the harm that each of the minorities within the larger minority ethnicity historically, traditionally, and currently inflict on their underprivileged segments. 
The recent claim to ascendancy of Blacks as the world's greatest victims has caused the grievances of all other colors and shades within those colors to be sidelined or overlooked. Its other flaw is that it has put Whites as the sole perpetrators of color and race-based injustices. 
This 'rush to judgment' stance appeared instantly in the wake of the horrific Atlanta shootings of eight innocents by a crazed, seriously troubled and mentally deranged youngster. The shootings occurred in three different spas/massage parlors. Of the eight victims, six of the dead were Asian women and one a White male. The eighth was a Hispanic male who survived the shooting and is hospitalized in intensive care. That the spas were mainly staffed and run by Asians would inevitably account for their bearing the brunt of mortality It is notable that a brother of the White male who was killed spoke of his and their family's loss but appealed to the people to not make the tragedy about race. The incident is vicious enough without adding to it the venom of ethnicity. 
Addressing the media following the arrest of the shooter, a spokes-person of the County Sheriff's Office clarified that while claiming responsibility for the shootings, the shooter denied any racial hatred and told police he believed he had a sex addiction, and that he saw the spas as ""a temptation... that he wanted to eliminate."" 
But that gave scant solace to race-agitators who increasingly seek to blame every crime on white suprema- cism. In earlier situations such as in the ramming of 84-year-old Vicha Ratanapakdee during his morning walk in his San Francisco neighborhood, resulting in his death two days later, even though the District Attorney charged the perpetrator with murder and elder abuse causing death, but not racism, the Indian American director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council was quick to claim: ""These attacks taking place in the Bay Area are part of a larger trend of anti-Asian American/Pacific Islander hate brought on in many ways by COVID-19, as well as some of the xenophobic policies and racist rhetoric that were pushed forward by the prior administration."" 
- 
It is undeniable that crime - civil, criminal, and racial in the Covid era, especially following 'defund police' initiatives, has grown astronomically But politicians and media show unprincipled and unprecedented 
enthusiasm to grasp the race straw with the clear intent to divide races in order to conquer them. 
That AAs have experienced a surge in crimes against them is also not disputed. According to a Stop AAPI Hate, 3,800 anti-Asian hate incidents -most directed at women - were reported in 2020 (1,200 more than the previous year). But it is also true that federal data, as cited on a news channel, suggest that violence in America occurs within racial groups, the exception being Asian Americans who are more likely to be attacked by African Americans than by members of their own ethnicity or by Whites. 
The Atlanta murders, once fully investigated, may well turn out to be racial in under- or over-tones. But there is no justification to hurry the verdict, or to add insult to injury by suggesting the killer wanted to cut down Asians. Nor should it be suggested that this represents the fetish White males have for Asian women as sex objects and therefore exploitable and expendable. What we need to decry as much as racism, are assessments such as offered by Charissa Cheah, a psychology professor: ""Those in power, and in this case those who are white and male, maintain their power partly by determining and defining what constitutes violations of these rules. What we are seeing is a key characteristic of institutional and systemic racism and misogyny."" 
Notice the contrasting absence of any assertion of racism in the more horrific March 22, 2021 killing of ten innocent shoppers in a grocery store in Colorado. In this case, even the name of the accused was not immediately announced, and media reporting or politicians' statements thus far have refrained from linking the Syrian immigrant's Muslim ethnicity to racial hate-based or terrorist crime. 
Unless evidence of calculated racist intent emerges, it would be just to treat the savage mass killings in Atlanta and Colorado not as products of White or Islamic racism but of sick minds' demonic acts that constitute a gross crime against humanity.

Racism and its deadly cousins,"Jealous, Ben",Others,2021-04-07													,"What does it say about our country when we don't have time to absorb the impact of one mass shooting before news of the next one comes across our phones and TV screens? 
Grief upon grief. 
This column is not about gun culture or laws that make it easier to buy an assault rifle than to register to vote. We need to talk about those things. 
But we also need to pay attention to one response to the Atlanta spa killings: the way some conservatives rushed to insist that race and racism had nothing to do with the murders. 
It is true that the man who confessed to the Atlanta killings said they were not racially motivated. He reportedly told police that he was struggling with a ""sex addiction"" and the killings were a way to ""eliminate temptation."" 
There's a lot in that statement to unpack, and a lot of smart people have been unpacking it over the past two weeks. 
Marcela Howell, who leads In Our Own Voice: National Black Women's Reproductive Agenda, was among the Black women who spoke in solidarity after the killings. ""While law enforcement officials have announced that the shooter's motivation was 'sex addiction,' we know that sexual violence and racism are often intertwined when it comes to violence against women,"" she said in a statement. ""As Black women, we know that our Asian-American sisters are disparately impacted at the intersections of racism, sexism, and xenophobia,"" Howell said. 
There is a long history of bigotry and legal discrimination that directly targeted Asian immigrants and Asian Americans. Over the past year, that hostility was inflamed by bigoted rhetoric from former President Donald Trump describing COVID-19 as the ""Kung flu"" and warning that if he weren't reelected Americans would have to learn Chinese. 
As Howell and many other activists and scholars have pointed out since the killings, racism in this country is deeply connected to sexism directed at women of color. And racism and misogyny are both intertwined with the history and culture of conservative white evangelicalism in which the Atlanta shooter was apparently steeped. 
Kathryn Gin Lum, an associate professor of American religion at Stanford University, said the killings reflected ""a toxic brew"" of racism, sexism, and religion. That toxic brew has been used to justify anti-Asian laws and stoked anti-Asian violence going back to the 19th Century. 
Religion scholar Bradley Onishi and others point out that Jim Crow apartheid and anti-race-mixing laws were not only defended as necessary to protect the sexual purity of individual white women, but also the racial and religious purity of White Christian America. Black women and Asian women have often been both fetishized and demonized as hypersex-ual temptresses threatening the innocence of and purity of white Christian men. Young people raised in churches that emphasize ""purity culture"" are taught to have deep shame about their sexual feelings, and girls' and young women's bodies portrayed as threats to boys and young men. 
We don't yet know, and may never fully understand, just how all these influences combined in the mind of this particular young man who chose to commit multiple murders. 
But we can and should push back against law enforcement officials, conservative pundits and religious leaders who dismiss the reality of systemic racism or refuse to recognize the ways that women of color are particularly harmed by the mixture of racism and sexism that plagues our culture.

Stop hate aimed at AAPI community,"Kulkarni, Manjusha; Choi, Cynthia; Jeung, Russell M ",Others,2021-04-05,"News about the deadly shooting in Atlanta broke almost one year to the day since we created the Stop AAPI Hate reporting center. 
Twelve months ago, our country was in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most Americans were entering their first quarantines and watching a virus spread faster than government systems could track. 
But Asian Americans were watching something spread even faster than COVID-19: Widespread hate and discrimination against members of our community. 
In early February, even before a single COVID-19 case was recorded in Los Angeles, a 12-year-old Asian American child in the city was physically assaulted in his school by a classmate who said he was a coronavirus carrier and that he should go back to China. 
At the time, incidents like these weren't broadly reported. But they were widespread - they were happening to our neighbors, colleagues, our family members and ourselves. 
We created Stop AAPI Hate so there was a way to capture the increasing attacks on our community. 
One year later, the vaccine provides a light at the end of the tunnel for the pandemic. But it seems there's no end in sight for anti-Asian hate. 
In the two weeks since our country watched in horror as eight people six of them Asian American women - were killed in Atlanta, we've been repeatedly asked why this is occurring. Many Asian Americans do not view these shootings in a vacuum. 
In the days leading up to the shooting, there were what seemed to be daily reports of violent, public attacks against Asian Americans - especially elderly Asian Americans - in places that included Oakland, San Francisco and New York City. 
The Atlanta shootings took place, in fact, hours after we published a report documenting nearly 3,800 self-reported hate incidents from the AAPI community. 
Anti-Asian hate and the scapegoating of immigrants is nothing new. But in looking through the thousands of reports that we received, several things came to the fore. 
For one, former President Donald Trump's and other government officials' widespread use of slurs like ""Kung Flu,"" his anti-China rhetoric and his exploitation of existing xenophobia played a major factor in normalizing and spreading hate against Asian Americans, both during the Trump administration and even now that his term is over. 
Asian Americans reported hearing these slurs like ""China virus"" thrown at them while they were refused business, harassed, spit on or attacked. 
There was also a devastating intersection between racism and misogyny. In our data, women reported incidents 2.3 times more often than men did. The reports and stories from these women often described being sexually harassed and COVID-19 being weaponized as part of the sexual harassment. 
""You Asian c---,"" one man yelled at Vietnamese American Hong Lee after she declined his offer of lunch last August. ""What is the matter with these hoes... Help her go back to f----- Asia."" 
This month, we've also been asked about what can be done. In the shadow of the Atlanta-area shooting, there is, understandably, a strong urge to focus on hate crime enforcement. 
For example, the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, authored by U.S. Sen. Mazie Hirono and U.S. Rep. Grace Meng, would require a Department of Justice employee to facilitate fast reviews of federal, state and local COVID-19 hate crimes for one year as well as mandate guidance to local enforcement to establish an online hate crime reporting form in multiple languages. 
Certainly, steps such as these can help address the lack of hate crime reporting. But the fact remains that 90% of the incidents reported to us are not hate crimes because no underlying crime was committed. Many are civil rights violations involving discrimination in the workplace, restaurants and retail venues and can be prosecuted in civil court. 
Racism against Asian Americans is longstanding and complex, and requires a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach. 
We need resources dedicated to local communities, including community safety programs and in-language support for those in need of mental health, legal and immigration services. 
We need to build a strong civil rights infrastructure at the local level by fully funding community-based groups, which are often the first responders to incidents of hate. 
We need to increase exposure to the voices and histories of all communities by expanding ethnic studies and education. 
And finally, we need stronger federal civil rights laws that address discrimination in public accommodations businesses where we buy our groceries, refill our 
prescriptions and eat our meals. 
These solutions are neither complex nor out-of-reach.
A number of groups across the country are already moving this work forward. In Los Angeles, LA vs. Hate provides direct assistance to victims of hate through a 211 reporting system for all marginalized community members. 
The San Francisco-based Coalition for Community Safety and Justice focuses on victim services, intervention and prevention programs, community mediation and restorative justice practices. 
We founded Stop AAPI Hate to not only raise awareness about anti-Asian hate but also to fight against it. 
The outpouring of support and solidarity from all racial groups that has risen up in the days since this tragedy gives us every reason to be optimistic. With the energy and calls for change we are seeing now, we are fundamentally hopeful that there is a true path forward in ending anti-Asian hate.

New Report Finds 81 Percent of Asian Americans Say Violence Against Them is Rising,"Tamanaha, Akemi",Others,2021-04-21,"A new report from the Pew Research Center found that 81 percent of Asian adults surveyed say that violence against Asians is increasing in America. One-third say they fear someone will threaten or physically attack them. 
The findings come from a Pew Research Center survey conducted from April 5 to 11, a few weeks after the fatal shootings in Atlanta killed six Asian women. 
Pew surveyed 5,109 U.S. adults, including 352 English-speaking Asian adults. Only 56 percent of all U.S. adults said that violence against Asians is increasing in the U.S., compared to 81 percent of Asian adults. 
The survey also asked Asian Americans if they had experienced five specific offensive incidents since the coronavirus pandemic began. About 45 percent of Asian respondents said they had experienced at least one of the five incidents. 
Asian respondents also gave several different reasons they believe violence against Asians is increasing. Some 20 percent said specifically that former President Donald Trump's rhetoric about the pandemic and China have contributed to the increase. 
Another 16 percent cited racism in the United States against Asian people, 15 percent cited the general rise in violence during the pandemic and 12 percent cited scapegoating Asians for the pandemic as a reason. Around 29 percent did not answer the question. 
Asian adults surveyed also said they experienced racism before the pandemic began. Around 73 percent said they personally experienced discrimination or had been treated unfairly because of their race or ethnicity before the pandemic. 
The survey also found that Asians were more likely to express fear over discrimination than racial and ethnic groups. They were also about as likely as Black adults to say they were subject to slurs and jokes since the start of the pandemic. ",1814
"Being polite won't do - it's time to stop racism; We cannot be innocent bystanders as attacks on Asians mount, says Ann Shin ",Ann Shin,Others,2021-04-10,"I count myself as part of polite Canada. I'm generally nice and I hate confrontations. But in light of recent events, I realize politeness just isn't going to cut it anymore. There is no politely appropriate response to the violent attack on 65-year-old Vilma Kari, a Philippine-American woman who was walking to church in New York. A number of bystanders watched while it happened, but one person tried to intervene by yelling and screaming at the assailant to stop. 
I was shocked and horrified watching the video of Kari being repeatedly kicked in the stomach and stomped on the face. The attack is one of countless acts of violence against Asians in recent months, including the shooting incident in Georgia in which eight people were killed, six of whom were Asian. 
When I first heard about these incidents, I hoped they were random events. I grew up in Vancouver and now work in Toronto, and none of the people I work with, nor the people I meet in Zoom meetings, are racist. I don't encounter racism at the grocery store or on the streets where I live. Those acts of violence I had read about didn't seem to reflect my reality, or that of most Canadians. 
But in fact, it's happening all around us. My partner was standing in line outside a bank in Toronto's Chinatown when someone started shouting at the Asian people in the queue, calling them ""ch--"" and telling them they didn't belong here. An Asian woman walking in Downtown Vancouver was confronted on the sidewalk and assaulted. 
Verbal harassment, spitting, outright acts of violence, the list of incidents in these and other cities across the globe goes on. Anti-Asian violence has been on the rise since the moment former U.S. President Donald Trump blamed China for the COVID-19 virus, calling it the ""Chinese virus."" He not only legitimized racism against Asians, he fanned the flames. 
As lockdowns were announced and the economy slowed down, feelings of anger, disempowerment and fear have intensified among the millions who have lost their jobs or homes, and along with them, their sense of security. Those of us who were struggling before the pandemic have it worse now with job cuts and the economic slowdown. The desperation caused by the pandemic has given rise to a dangerous kind of populism, creating an environment in which extremist groups like Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers have thrived, and in which individuals have felt licence to commit acts of hate crime. In July 2020, Statistics Canada reported that the rate of increase of harassment or attacks based on race or skin colour had tripled among visible minorities compared to the rate among the rest of the population since the start of the pandemic. The largest increase was seen among Chinese, Korean and Southeast Asians. 
So what does this have to do with those of us who don't hate Asians or visible minorities? We can post and retweet others' posts that condemn acts of hate crime - which I have done, and in my non-confrontational way, I am showing my support. But is that enough? What do these violent attacks have to do with me? I remember as a kid being called ""ch-"" by a boy who was hanging out with his friend. I felt deeply ashamed and all I could splutter out as a comeback was, ""But I'm not Chinese!"" As if by pointing that out, I could refute the racism. 
Part of what was behind my response was my confusion and outrage. I was trying to say that they didn't see me for who I was - a girl born in Canada and raised on Kraft Dinner, as well as homemade apple pies and kimchee. English was my first language. I had a pet dog. I wrote poems and played basketball. I lived the ""normal"" North American life. 
The other part of what I was saying, however, stemmed from a more cowardly impulse. By saying ""I'm not Chinese,"" I was also saying, ""I'm not part of the ethnic group I believe you're targeting with your racism."" As if by differentiating myself from the targeted group, I could somehow sidestep the racism. I felt the aspirational whiteness that Margaret Cho speaks about, and I wanted the racist bullies to accept me for who I was. I was willing to throw Chinese-Americans under the bus to make that happen. I felt ashamed and defenceless against the boy's racism, as do most people when they are attacked. 
But the bystander in this equation had power - a kind of power that is often not flexed, or even realized. What if that boy's friend had stepped in and said, ""That's not right, that's not right at all!"" What if that friend had called the boy out on his racist comment? Could that have helped change the boy's behaviour, if not his attitude? It's been decades since I've been called ch--, but as I see the rise of anti-Asian hate around me, I realize that when we don't speak up, we are not simply being non- confrontational bystanders, we are complicit with this behaviour in the world. We cannot be innocent bystanders as racism is on the rise. In these desperate times, all us ""polite people"" have to speak more loudly than we are used to doing, so that people filled with hatred and fear cannot assume they have licence to commit acts of hate crime. 
We should be like the witness who yelled and screamed at Vilma Kari's attacker. 
We need to do more to recognize the humanity of those targeted by acts of hate crime. To recognize the humanity of Hyun Jung Grant, Soon Chung Park, Delaina Ashley Yaun, Suncha Kim, Paul Andre Michels, Yong Ae Yue, Xiaojie Tan, Daoyou Feng and Elcias Hernandez-Ortiz. To recognize the humanity of every Philippine nanny, novelist or firefighter. To recognize every Mexican farmhand, lawyer and actor. To recognize every Black man jogging in Stanley Park, doing stem cell research, or going to university. To recognize that the Indigenous person waiting for proper hospital care is like me. I am them. 
They are us and we are them. And in recognizing the common humanity we share, we need to stand up and defend it. 
So if you see someone perpetrating an act of violence, or if you see a racist posting, speak up. Interrupt and intervene. Make it known to the perpetrator and their peers that the rule of law will be upheld. Honour and defend the values of our hard-won democracy, and together we defeat hate.

Monster bash proves a box office smash,None,Others,2021-04-05						,"A week after Warner Bros.' international rollout of ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" set a new pandemic record for a Hollywood film, its North American release continued to hint at a forthcoming return to the box office with a pandemic-best opening of $48.5 million (U.S.) over five days since its Wednesday debut and $32.2 million this weekend, according to estimates from measurement firm Comscore. 
The previous benchmark for a pandemic-era domestic opening was the debut of ""Wonder Woman 1984"" in December, with $16.7 million over the three-day Christmas weekend. ""Godzilla vs. Kong,"" which simultaneously debuted domestically in theatres and on HBO Max, played in 3,064 locations, the most since the pandemic began more than a year ago. It currently stands at $285.4 million in global receipts. 
""The resounding success of 'Godzilla vs. Kong' represents an incredibly important and positive milestone both financially and symbolically for the movie industry,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst at Comscore. ""We are seeing that as consumer confidence grows, so too does the ability of movie theatres to generate stronger box office."" 
Elsewhere at the box office this weekend, Sony Screen Gems' ""The Unholy"" opened in 1,850 locations to $3.2 million and Atlas Distribution's ""The Girl Who Believes in Mirades"" premiered in 680 locations to $580,068. 
Although U.S. theatres are slowly returning after a year of harried reopenings and closings, major theatres including Regal and AMC and smaller chains have not yet reopened.

Nike sues maker of Lil Nas X shoes 
Looks like Lil Nas X's ""Satan Shoes"" collaboration has taken a step too far. 
The Hollywood Reporter said fulfilment of orders of the controversial sneaker has stopped after a U.S. District Court in New York approved Nike's request for a temporary restraining order against Mschf, the Brooklyn-based collective that collaborated with the singer-rapper on the shoes. 
Nike sued the collective Monday, alleging trademark infringement, false designation of origin and trademark dilution. The sneakers are based on Nike's Air Max 97, but with a pentagram pendant and a drop of human blood in every sole. 
Lil Nas X, who was not listed as a defendant in the lawsuit, released the sneakers as part of a promotion for his new song ""Montero (Call Me by Your Name).""

Arden Cho says she experienced a racist attack in which a man threatened to kill her. The ""Teen Wolf"" star was walking her dog Wednesday night when the man screamed ""I'm going to motherf---ing kill you c--- and your f---ing dog,"" she said in an emotional Instagram post. Cho, a second-generation Korean American who also stars on ""Chicago Med,"" encouraged other people to speak up against anti-Asian racism and violence, which has increased since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. 
Simon Bassett, the character played by Regé-Jean Page, the breakout star of the Netflix series ""Bridgerton,"" will not return for the show's second season, Netflix and Shondaland, Shonda Rhimes' production company, announced Friday. The news was delivered, appropriately enough, via a missive from Lady Whistledown, the show's mysterious narrator - and sometimes instigator - of scandal. 
DMX's longtime New York-based lawyer, Murray Richman, said the rapper was on life support Saturday evening at White Plains Hospital. ""He had a heart attack. He's quite ill,"" Richman said. Richman said he could not confirm reports that DMX, 50, overdosed on drugs and was not sure what caused the heart attack. Over the years, DMX has battled with substance abuse. The rapper cancelled a series of shows to check himself into a rehabilitation facility in 2019. On Instagram, his team said he apologized for the cancelled shows.

"Anti-Asian hate incidents are on the rise in Canada: 'Go back to China,' one local family told during a child's birthday party",None,Others,2021-04-09,"The recent horrendous fatal shooting of eight people - six of them of Asian descent - was yet another senseless killing by an American man who hated women and, in particular, Asian women. This horrific crime was stretched to nearly one hour at three different Atlanta adult parlours, resulting in targeted hatred toward mostly Asian 
women. 
The audacious Cherokee County Sheriff's Office's Capt. Jay Baker's synopsis of the killer's actions was: ""He was pretty much fed up and kind of at the end of his rope. Yesterday was a really bad day for him, and this is what he did."" The loss of eight innocent lives relegated to this evil criminal carnage to ""a bad day"" is perturbing. 
As painful as it was to hear these comments from the sheriff, internet sleuths and journalists found Baker's Facebook posts promoting shirts that called COVID-19 an ""IMPORTED VIRUS FROM CHY-NA."" 
With the rhetoric coming from the U.S. during this COVID era, there has been an increase in Asian hate incidents in Canada. According to Project 1907, a grassroots group made up of Asian women that collects data on incidents of racism, hate, and violence experienced by the Asian diaspora in Canada: 
Canada has a higher number of anti-Asian racism reports per Asian capita than the United States; 
Women are impacted the most, reporting six per cent of all incidents; 
In B.C., women are even more disproportionately impacted, accounting for nearly 70 per cent of all reported incidents; 
Verbal abuse and harassment are widespread, occurring in 65 per cent of all reported incidents; 
Nearly 30 per cent of reported incidents are assault, including targeted coughing, spitting and physical attacks and violence. 
According to a report released by the Vancouver Police Department, there has been a 717 per cent increase in anti-Asian hate crimes from 2019 to 2020. On April 3, Fight COVID Racism reported 980 incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes across Canada during the pandemic. 
According to 2016 Statistics Canada, approximately 1,400 people of Asian descent live in Peterborough, and during this COVID pandemic, they have been feeling the effects of anti-Asian racism. Their racist incidents have been more subtle, a microaggression, ""feeling of being watched"" or ""getting a look,"" the feeling of ""what are you doing here,"" or ""you don't belong here."" 
During this COVID-19 era, members of an Asian family who have lived in Peterborough for a few years were celebrating their child's birthday party. For the first time since living in Peterborough, a stranger yelled, ""Go back to China."" 
Not all Asians are from China, and they are not a monolithic ethnic group. 
The diversity among Asians is vast and varied like any other ethnic group. The ignorance of people, allied with the philosophy of Trumpism, has given rise to the anti-Asian racism. Their narrative may also include references to the Chinese Communist political system and Chinese oligarchy. These detrimental opinions are red herrings and should have no place within the context of anti-Asian racism. 
Instead, we need to stop this cycle of hate toward those who are different from ourselves. Stop the labelling of others, eliminate the negative stereotypes; stop the microaggressions! We need to come together in solidarity and break the exclusivity barriers to create a supportive, welcoming, caring society - one where we are all treated with dignity, respect, and equity as human beings. 
We need to move beyond our statements, Black Lives Matter, Stop Asian Hate; we need to take a stand and be bold. These actions can range from checking in with your Asian friends on their well-being. Are they feeling safe in our community? Listening to other racialized groups, hearing their narratives, educating yourselves, being bold and taking a stand against hate. 
Even small acts of kindness give us hope, energy, and the opportunity for conversations. As Peterboroughians, reach out and make this community a place that treats all citizens regardless of a person's demographic: race, gender, religion, gender orientation, ethnic group, social-economic status, or ability/disability as one with equity.

Kentucky Home Vandalized With Anti-Asian Slurs,"Tamanaha, Akemi",Others,2021-04-28,"A home in northeast Louisville, Kentucky, has been vandalized with anti-Asian slurs, ABC 11 reports. 
Todd Blankenship opened his door around 11 a.m. on Saturday, April 24, to find the words ""GO HOME, Chinese communists,"" and other racial slurs spray-painted in yellow across his home. 
Blankenship lives in the home with his Thai American wife Sassy and their three children. Sassy has a green card and is currently going through the process of becoming a citizen, according to WLKY. 
Sassy has lived in America for the past four years. In those four years, she says she has never experienced discrimination until now. 
""I feel sad because I don't understand. I am Thai, I am an Asian woman. I did not hurt anyone. I did not do anything bad,"" Sassy told ABC 11. 
Blankenship said he didn't think this type of incident happened in their ""nice neighborhood.” He added that the hardest part of the situation is explaining it to his daughter. 
""We've been married for five years, and the hardest part of this whole thing is I had to have a conversation with my 4-year-old daughter this morning about why someone didn't like her because of the color of her skin,"" he told WLKY. ",1174
K-pop idol looks to begin a new chapter in his career: Got7's Mark Tuan wants to use his platform to encourage others to change the world for the better ,"Herman, Tamar",Others,2021-04-26													,"Mark Tuan sometimes forgets he's not a normal 27-year-old guy living in the US state of California, and is surprised by things such as when his fans crashed the audio streaming platform Clubhouse after he signed up. 
Tuan is one-seventh of popular K-pop boy band Got7, and has just moved home from Seoul in South Korea to be close to his family as he starts a new stage in his career. He wants to use his platform to influence fans to change the world in a positive way. 
""It gets to me all the time,"" Tuan says about the fervour with which his fans support him. ""I'm still not used to that, I've been doing this for, like, seven years now. You would think I'd get used to it, but it still surprises me that fans are still that crazy and supportive, and that we have that much power. It's super cool."" 
Joining Clubhouse is just one of the many things Tuan has been trying lately: he and the rest of Got7 parted ways with their label JYP Entertainment this year after debuting with the South Korean company in 2014. The group plan to remain together, but each member is doing his own thing. 
For Tuan, that means moving home to the United States - which he left when he was a 16-year-old dreaming of superstardom - and figuring out who he is as a soloist. The star, who is of Taiwanese descent, recently launched a personal studio in China to grow his career in Chinese entertainment. 
""I think the biggest goal for me right now is to be able to find my sound. I'm not given a song now. I have to go out and make the song with people."" 
Tuan is in the studio four or five days each week, and released One in a Million with Bangladeshi-American musician Sanjoy in February. In it, he shared thoughts on his life and his career. There'll be more of that on his upcoming, still-in-the-works album. 
""It's going to be about my journey, my career, everything. I think it will be super cool that fans can see a more personal side of me because I think I was pretty quiet."" 
For Tuan, expressing himself aloud is a work in progress. ""One time, the members got kind of upset with me. 'How come you never share your story or tell us about how you feel about anything?' I think having the six other boys there kind of made it more easy for me to open up."" 
Tuan says moving home was a major comfort to him after being so far apart when it felt the most urgent to be with his loved ones. 
""I was worried a lot about the family during Covid. My parents both got the vaccine. And right now in the States, everyone's getting the vaccine so it seems like it's getting much safer."" 
The pandemic isn't the only thing worrying Tuan when it comes to his family's safety. The star is concerned about the rising hate and violence directed at Asian-Americans. 
""I'm really scared for my parents. Having them go on their daily walks and stuff like that... it's scary. I hear stories about my friends, they have people that they know that have almost got attacked, and I have friends that hear racial comments."" 
Tuan wants to use his platform to raise awareness of what's going on and how to bring about social justice and change. He recently donated US$30,000 to Stop AAPI Hate, a non-profit organisation that runs the Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Centre, which tracks incidents of discrimination against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders. He's also donated to support Black Lives Matters in the past. 
""Right now, there's a lot of hate and violent acts towards Asian-Americans. Before this, it was Black Lives Matter ... it's difficult seeing so much hate and racism towards everybody. It doesn't matter what race you are, there's so much hate going around. I don't like seeing that. 
""Having people hear [about my donations] and making people more aware of stuff like this, I think it will at least contribute and help. Even if it helps just a little bit, I think that's what the main goal is right now."" 
Although things are tough right now, he admits he's looking forward to living life as a twenty-something and working hard to develop his career with the support of family and friends, many of whom work with him. 
""I don't think it's a bad thing that I'm [physically] back at where I started when I went to Korea; I think it's pretty cool I get to learn new things. Being there, I grew up a lot and matured a lot. The biggest thing I learned is not to stress out too much about the outcome of things. Because if I do stress out, it kind of puts me in a bad mood."" 
He pauses to play with his dog, who has been squeaking a toy loudly, and laughs as a PR rep on the call - one of his friends says, ""Mark is a student of life"". Playing with his dog and golfing are two ways he unwinds after stressing about work and his goals as he heads down this new path.
""Being in Korea and starting my career pretty early, it made me have that mindset to keep working harder no matter what. Whether the outcome [reaches] my expectations, I feel like that doesn't get to me as hard because I know I tried my hardest and I have no regrets about the outcome. 
""That's the biggest thing I have learned. If I want to do something, I gotta give it my all and have no regrets at the end.""

Vietnamese embassy in US moves to fight discrimination against Asian Americans,None,Others,2021-04-07					,"A demonstration against Asian hate in the US. XINHUA/VNA Photo NEW YORK The Vietnamese Embassy in the US has repeatedly contacted with and canvassed authorities and parliaments of the US and its states to ensure security and safety as well as the right to access full services for Vietnamese citizens and Vietnamese Americans in the US, given increasing discrimination against the Asian American community in the country. 
Discussing with representatives from the White House National Security Council (NSC), the Department of State and parliament committees, the Vietnamese side expressed concern over discrimination and even violence suffered by Vietnamese citizens in the US and Vietnamese Americans related to the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Vietnamese representative office in the US has always emphasised active contributions of the Vietnamese Americans and overseas Vietnamese community in the US to the host country, especially to the front lines of the COVID-19 fight to ensure health, security and social welfare for people across the US. 
On March 31, Vietnamese Ambassador Hà Kim Ngc and ambassadors of other ASEAN countries to the US sent a letter to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and the NSC condemning discrimination targeting Asian Americans. They also asked local authorities to continue carrying out measures to address the issue, including ensuring security and the right to access healthcare, education, employment and other social welfare services for them. 
Ambassador Ngc also sent letters to US members of Congress, including Senator Patrick Leahy, President pro tempore of the Senate; Congressman Ami Bera, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, Central Asia, and Nonproliferation; and Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy, the first Vietnamese American woman elected to Congress, to require them to raise their voice to end racial discrimination against Vietnamese citizens and Vietnamese Americans in the US. The NSC and the Department of State acknowledged ideas of the representative offices of Vit Nam and other ASEAN countries in Washington DC, pledging to maintain support to ensure interests of the Asian American community in the US. 
The Vietnamese embassy has frequently maintained information channels and provided around-the-clock support for people in need. For support, people are advised to call hotlines of the Vietnamese Embassy in the US, Vit Nam's Consulates General in Houston, San Francisco and New York, and the Citizen Protection Call Centre of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry's Consular Department. 
Earlier, US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris strongly condemned the hate and violence against Asian Americans, and committed to putting an end to the issue. Senator Patrick Leahy and Congressman Ami Bera also tweeted to protest the discrimination. 
Meanwhile, Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy ran an article in the Washington Post, criticising discrimination against Asian Americans and showing support for the Biden administration to intensify measures to protect them. -- VNS

Senate passes bipartisan bill to combat hate crimes against Asian Americans,"Brest, Mike",Others,2021-04-22		,"The Senate passed legislation to combat anti-Asian hate crimes more forcefully in a nearly unanimous vote. 
The bipartisan bill passed Thursday 94-1, with only Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri objecting. 
The bill, which Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono sponsored, would establish a position within the Justice Department to review and expedite all reports of such hate crimes, and it would expand support for state agencies to respond to such hate crimes. 
MAN ARRESTED FOR NYC HATE CRIME AGAINST ASIAN WOMAN PREVIOUSLY CONVICTED OF KILLING HIS MOTHER 
""By passing this bill, the Senate makes it very clear that hate and discrimination against any group has no place in America,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, the majority leader. ""By passing this bill, we say to the Asian American community that their government is paying attention to them, has heard their concerns, and will respond to protect them."" 
The bill will go to the House of Representatives and will then head to President Joe Biden's desk. 
Hirono introduced the bill, titled ""the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act,"" following a year in which hate crimes against Asian Americans have risen. 
Hate crimes against Asian Americans spiked 150% throughout 2020, and experts have said that the coronavirus pandemic, which originated in China, could have fueled some of the rise in violence. 
CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER 
The bill was introduced five days before a man murdered eight people, six of whom were Asian, in three separate shootings in Atlanta. The alleged shooter denied his acts were racially motivated, rather he said, according to police, that he is a ""sex addict"" and wanted to ""eliminate"" the ""temptation"" of massage parlors. 
Activists claimed the shooter's argument is rooted in anti-Asian hate, given the stereotypes of Asian massage parlors.

'Quiet anxieties': Tallahassee's Asian Americans grapple with hidden hatred,"Brown, Marina",Others,2021-04-25												,"It's spring and it's cherry blossom time in the nation's capital. A time when America glories in the beauty of the 3,000 cherry trees gifted to us in 1912 by the mayor of Tokyo to celebrate friendship between America and the Japanese people. Last week was also the one-month anniversary of the killing of six Asian women in Atlanta and a vigil was held on the Florida State University Campus. NBC reports there have been 3,800 reported attacks this year on people of Asian descent, up nearly 1,000 from the year before. On Thursday, the U.S. Senate passed an Anti-Asian Hate bill in a 94-1 vote, after hearing testimony from Asian-Americans, including Senator Amy Duckworth, about their own experiences of discriminatory behaviors. The bi-partisan legislation now heads to the Democratic-led House. The recent violence has left Tallahassee Asia Americans unsettled but hopeful. We talked to four about their experiences. 
Artist Yoshiko Murdick worries 
Yoshiko Murdick is a sought-after Tallahassee watercolor painter. She is now 70 years old and has lived in the United States since her 20s when, as an exchange student, she fell in love with her English professor. ""Convenient subject,"" she deadpans with gentle humor. 
Murdick is self-deprecating at times, funny, and like many ethnically diverse people who know they are easily identifiable by their physical features and sometimes behaviors, she finds herself with a constant, low-grade anxiety. 
""I know I act 'funny',"" she says, describing her tendency to still make an honorary bow in greeting or gratitude. ""Old habit."" But what Murdick says she didn't know was the ""hatred that exists here."" 
Lately, when she walks her cuddly dog, she says she doesn't make eye contact with other walkers any longer. ""I try to avoid looking at other people... maybe they are looking at me."" 
She, in fact, has been worried enough to buy a stun gun. ""A friend of mine in New Jersey was also worried. She quit her job in Manhattan. She did not want to ride the subways or go into the city where the old woman was beaten and nobody helped."" 
Murdick says that she is concerned about those she loves. ""As a first-generation American, we hear, ""Go home!"" But the second-generation people can only answer, ""Where?"" Home is here."" 
Although she believes the politics of the previous four years and identifying the COVID virus as a product of Asia set the stage, Murdick also feels it exposed a lot of attitudes she never had suspected. 
Aurora Hansen plans mini Asia fest 
Aurora Hansen, of Filipino descent, is a woman whose influence and involvement in the Tallahassee community stretches far and wide. Artistic Director of Tallahassee Community College's Dance Company; Community Liaison for the Asian Student Union at FSU, Past Chair of the Asian Coalition of Tallahassee, are among her many contributions to the city. 
Currently, she is involved in planning for an Experience Asia Mini Festival, the precursor to the annual large Experience Asia festival held in the fall. ""The Mini Festival, set for May 22, in a downtown park, is much like the big one, with Asian music, performers, and food,"" she says. ""Details will be released soon."" 
And how does Hansen feel about the current racial climate in the country? Does she wonder if now is a good time to put on an Asian festival? 
""Yes, there are quiet anxieties,"" she says. ""Even here in Tallahassee, I, myself have experienced a 'situation.'"" Hansen says that recently, in Midtown, she was accosted by someone who pushed her and said, ""Get out of my America."" 
Hansen was not cowed, she says, and stood up for herself. But she notes there is often more subtle discrimination, beyond bullying and name-calling. 
She notes that Asian associations around the country have been meeting to offer one another support and reminders of safe behaviors such as ""having a buddy go with you into parking garages, and being aware of places you may be vulnerable."" 
Portia Campos is 'horrified and angry' 
Hansen is working with Portia Campos, an Assistant Teaching Professor as FSU. Her husband is President of the Big Bend Filipino Association of Tallahassee and she is equally involved in advocacy groups which offer up insights and the ability to experience Asian culture. 
""I am horrified and angry at the targeting,"" she says, noting that she worries about elderly parents in Jacksonville and an autistic brother. ""I stay home more now and don't go certain places alone."" 
But Campos is nevertheless feeling excited about the planned Asian festivals. ""I believe the local authorities are aware, and though I am a little nervous, we have been putting on these festivals for 18 or 19 years, and I feel good about the Tallahassee community."" 
FSU student Tanvi Marulendra calls for empathy 
Tanvi Marulendra, who is of Indian descent, will graduate this year from FSU. She is the Director of the Asian American Student Union. 
While she notes there has been no violence on campus, she says racial slurs, and insensitive comments have always been present, and not just this year. 
""It is our families that we worry about at the moment,"" she says. ""So many Asian people work in the nail salon and hair industry, and the Atlanta violence felt much closer."" 
Marulendra says the Asian American Student Union has met with the administration advocating for greater diversity in teaching faculty and staff, and for cultural sensitivity training. ""They have been pretty attentive in the past few weeks,"" she says. 
The group held a campus vigil on the evening of April 16 in memoriam for the six lives lost in Atlanta. Most of all, Marulendra asks of Tallahasseeans is that they remember that each of us is part of a family group, with people we love and worry about, and that that doesn't change, no matter our ethnicity.
""What I hope for and urge is simply for people to lean into their empathy,"" she says to look beyond superficial differences, to look out for one another. 
And then inhale the aroma of cherry blossoms.

MESSAGE FROM THE IMMIGRATION HISTORY RESEARCH CENTER ON ANTI-ASIAN HATE AND VIOLENCE ,None,Others,2021-04-21,"On March 16, 2021, eight people were murdered at three different Asian-owned businesses in the greater Atlanta region in a mass shooting. Six of the eight victims were Asian women. 
As IIIRC Director Erika Lee explained in her testimony before the US House Judiciary Committee's hearings on anti-Asian discrimination and violence on March 18th, this massacre is just the latest act of anti-Asian violence in our history and especially this year. These arc not isolated incidents. They are part of the history of systemic racism and misogyny in the US. For Asian Americans, this history has included laws that barred their entry into the US and prevented them from becoming naturalized citizens, mass incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War Two, profiling and surveillance of Muslim, Arab, and South Asian Americans after 9/11. Most recently, some of our highest elected officials deliberately and consistently used racist language tying COVID-19 to Asians. This has included phrases like the ""Chinese virus"" and ""Wuhan virus"" and telling Americans to ""blame China"" for the pandemic. These words matter, especially when they repeatedly came from the White House during the previous administration. Researchers found that the anti-Chinese rhetoric promoted by leaders directly correlated with a rise in racist incidents against Asian Americans. 
Since the pandemic began, nearly 3,800 anti-Asian incidents of harassment, discrimination, and violence in all 50 states and the District of Columbia have been reported to Stop AAP1 Hate, a coalition of Asian American-serving organizations. The vast majority (nearly 70 %) were directed at Asian women, a pattern that continues a history of both racial and misogynist anti-Asian violence in the US. Over 40% of respondents identify as Chinese. Many other victims identify as Korean, Vietnamese, Filipino, Japanese, Taiwanese, Hmong, and more. 
The IIIRC condemns racism, white supremacy, misogyny, and xenophobia in all of its forms and stands in unity with all individuals and communities who are targets of racial violence and sexual violence, and we support a community-centered response to violence against Asian American communities.

Asian-Americans must unite and end timid stereotype: Jodi Xu Klein says the lack of a shared struggle has muted the many Asian voices in America,Jodi Xu Klein,Others,2021-04-05													,"Last month, in the wake of the killing of six Asian women at a spa in Atlanta, Georgia, the United States woke up to the hostility Asian-Americans have lived with since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
As people grappled with the shocking surge in verbal and physical attacks targeting Asians, some major news outlets attributed the slow emergence of the worsening situation to the quiet nature of Asian people. 
But that story was incomplete and inaccurate. What had prevented these incidents from surfacing faster was less about the shyness of Asians. What had been exposed was a fragmented Asian community. While Asians are looked upon as the same in the eyes of the West, they are not monolithic - far from it. 
Each Asian nation has its own unique heritage. Their people have different sets of struggles and at times have struggled against each other. The Chinese and the Koreans felt strong resentment against Japan for its government's mass killings during World War II. These memories are very much alive and continue to haunt trade, economic and interpersonal relationships. 
These dynamics are also reflected among Asian immigrants in the US. Some 20 million Asian Americans trace their roots to more than 20 countries in East Asia, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent, according to the Pew Research Centre. 
Many Asians in the US are first-generation immigrants, and new immigrants also typically participate less with other members of society outside their family group as they tend to be focused on making a living in their new country. 
Asian-Americans have not been united by an inclusive, singular identity. They are a collection of people from Asia who live in the same country. There has been a lack of a sense of cause or shared struggle. This is the main dynamic that has muted the many voices of US Asian communities. 
After the deadly Georgia shooting, that sense of common cause has been growing. Asian-Americans in Congress have loudly condemned the crimes. One memorable moment came when Grace Meng, a Democrat from New York, called out the violence and discrimination at a hearing on Capitol Hill in March. 
""Our community is bleeding. We are in pain,"" she said. She told a panel that the rising tide of anti-Asian bigotry was fuelled partly by rhetoric from former US president Donald Trump, who repeatedly referred to Covid-19 as the ""China virus"" and ""kung flu”. Other lawmakers such as Bee Nguyen and Sam Park also spoke out against race- based hate crimes. 
It is true that Asian culture might be less confrontational than others, but that should not be confused as a sign of weakness. Anyone following the protests in Myanmar can see that their battles for democracy are loud, persistent and at times brutal. Many protesters are willing to give up their lives for a cause bigger than themselves. There is nothing shy and timid about that. 
Many in the US can attest to that quiet bravery. Senator Tammy Duckworth, a Thai-American, lost her legs serving in the Iraq war. Lee Wong, an Asian-American Army veteran, bared his chest during a meeting in West Chester, Ohio, last month to show the vicious-looking scars he sustained from his service. 
It is simplistic for the media to explain away an invisibility problem with Asian shyness. That is a stereotype and, more accurately, a form of racism in itself. 
The bloodshed in Georgia might be the needed moment for Asian unity. Since that massacre, Asians have grown more vigilant and more clear-headed about keeping their loved ones safe as well as responding to a call for action. More solidarity is needed on the ground level, maybe with the help of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus that has been pushing for such a coalition on the Hill for years. 
No matter how vastly different each Asian person might feel from each other, it was made abundantly clear how similar we are, or at least we are perceived. In a year of escalating attacks, people of Chinese ethnicity are not the only ones targeted. 
The racist ""China virus"" rhetoric had nothing to do with South Korea - its government has been among the best in handling the pandemic – and yet four people of Korean descent fell victim to the senseless shooting in Atlanta. 
As the US death toll from the pandemic continued to climb because of Washington's inability to contain the virus under Trump, more Americans bought into the false narrative that Asians were at fault and continued to look for scapegoats to soothe their disgruntled selves. 
The worsening abuses that continue to this day should jolt Asians awake to the reality that to unite is the only way forward. It was, and continues to be, about life or death. Maybe this can be the moment when Asians will come together under the same cause - against the hate crimes targeting the group. 
Asians would then learn to have each other's back regardless of their countries of origin. Then there could be a real chance for an equitable voice that starts with breaking the stereotypical image of Asian timidity.

PH consulate in NY urges Filipinos to report hate crimes ,None,Others,2021-04-10,"Manila, April 10 – As the attacks against the Asian American community continue to rise, the Philippine Consulate in New York urges Filipinos who experience these attacks to immediately report. 
""As we pray for an end to hate, racism, and discrimination, we also urge our kababayan to do their share. We call on all Filipinos who experience or witness any hate crime to immediately dial 911 to report the incident. We also urge Filipino victims or those who know of Filipino victims to immediately get in touch with us at the Consulate General so we could render assistance,"" the Philippines' new consul general in New York, Elmer Cato, said in a statement. 
Cato was referring to the recent attack on 65-year-old Filipino-American Vilma Kari, who was brutally assaulted by former convict Brandon Elliot.

Filipinos are advised to immediately report hate crimes to the Consulate General's Assistance to Nationals Hotline at 917-239-4118 or to send an email to [emailprotected] 
Cato cited that there are about 2.4 million AAPI residents in the New York City Metro Area alone, who contribute more than USD6.2 billion in state and local tax revenues. 
""Our contribution does not end here. In the battle against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), Filipino nurses remain in the frontline against the pandemic,"" he added. 
Data from the National Nurses United showed that four percent of nurses in the United States and about 30 percent of the almost 200 registered nurses who died from COVID-19 are Filipinos, said Cato, adding that 25 percent of Filipinos in New York work in the healthcare industry. 
""It is, thus, ironic for Elliot to insist that Vilma and the AAPI community she belongs to do not belong here,"" he said. 
""In these trying times, the Consulate General of the Philippines would like to assure our kababayan in New York and those in other states under our jurisdiction that we remain fully committed in looking after their well-being,"" Cato said.

Brooklyn Man Faces Multiple Charges for Hate Crimes,"Roetcisoender, Isabelle",Others,2021-04-08,"Joseph Russo, 27, faces multiple charges for hate crimes against Asian Americans. 
The first incident occurred on March 5 around 9:20 a.m. local time in the Gravesend neighborhood of Brooklyn. Russo is accused of pushing a 64-year-old Asian American woman onto the sidewalk, ABC reported. 
On March 22, around 7:45 a.m. local time, authorities charge him with attacking an Asian American for the second time. Police say he grabbed a 32-year-old Asian woman by her hair on Kings Highway in Homecrest. 
In a video released by police, Russo can be seen dragging the victim by her hair a few feet before releasing her, according to the New York Post. 
In the third and most recent incident, Russo randomly pushed a 77-year-old man while he looked at vegetables for sale in front of the J&R NY Supermarket in Sheepshead Bay. 
Cops have stated Russo is facing charges of assault and harassment as hate crimes in each of the incidents.",928
Show of 'faith over fear' ,"Zou, Dandan ",Others,2021-04-02,"Community members, faith leaders and elected officials bowed their heads in silence at a vigil Thursday night in Mineola to mourn the victims of hate crimes and call for unity amid recent attacks nationwide targeting Asian Americans. 
The rally, organized by the Nassau County Office of Asian American Affairs and County Executive Laura Curran, attracted an ethnically diverse crowd of about 100 - Asian American advocates, children with their parents, and others there to show support. Some attendees held a single white rose each while others clutched small, flickering electronic candles. 
""We owe it to our elderly to not only protect them from verbal and physical assaults and help them when they are hurting but also to listen to their journeys and our families' histories,"" Olivia Wong, 17, a senior at New Hyde Park Memorial High School, told the crowd. 
""There are things of beauty, determination and resilience in their stories that make us proud to be Asian Americans,"" she said. 
Earlier Thursday at the same place where Wong and others gathered, Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced his support for a bill that would give the U.S. Department of Justice and local law enforcement more tools to combat the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes throughout the pandemic. 
The ""COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act"" was introduced by Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Rep. Grace Meng (D-Queens) last month. 
If passed, the legislation would require U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland to designate a department employee to do an expedited review of COVID-19 hate crimes and issue guidance to law enforcement on establishing online reporting of hate crimes in multiple languages. 
""The fear in the Asian community and the threat of violence and harassment against its members should be a topic of national conversation,"" Schumer said. "" American community is quintessentially American. We stand by them. We will continue to stand by them until all this hate is eradicated."" 
The Asian 
The proposal would require the attorney general and secretary of Health and Human Services to work with the COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force, created in February by President Joe Biden's administration, and community organizations, to issue best practices to ""mitigate racially discriminatory language in describing the COVID-19 pandemic."" 
Some advocates and experts have tied the surge of anti-Asian crimes during the pandemic to the economic downturn and the rhetoric of politicians like former President Donald Trump, who repeatedly called COVID-19 the ""China virus."" 
Vanna Ye, a Chinese American, and a member of Nassau's Asian American Advisory Council, said the words of a leader matter. 
""I'm very happy that we have a community and elected officials on the federal level stand in solidarity to condemn the hate,"" said Ye, of Manhasset Hills, at Schumer's news conference. ""It's about time. Enough is enough."" 
Ye said she planned to attend a #StopAsianHate rally in Manhattan's Koreatown later Thursday despite fear over her safety on public transit. 
""I'm afraid that the instances that happened will happen to me,"" she said. ""But I think I need to go to stand up [against hate]."" 
Violent assaults nationwide in recent months have put the Asian American community on high alert. 
Video footage has shown Asian elders and subway riders shoved and attacked. In San Francisco, an 84-year-old Thai man died after being slammed to the pavement in January. Closer to home in New York City, the NYPD reported 28 hate crime incidents involving Asians, up from three in 2019. Earlier this week, a 65-year-old Asian woman on her way to church was kicked and stomped in Hell's Kitchen. 
At the vigil Thursday night, one woman brought a painting she made earlier in the day, depicting a young Asian woman accompanied by the words: ""We are not silent. I'm not your scapegoat."" 
Before the vigil started, Rev. Binu Thomas of Great Neck said he came to the rally to show solidarity. 
""It's important that we all support each other,"" said Thomas, an Indian American and associate pastor at the Edge City Church in Mineola. ""When it comes to [racial] injustice, we tend to stay in our bubble - African Americans in African American bubble, Asian Americans in Asian American bubble, Hispanic Americans in their bubble. ... That's what we've done in the past too often. And I think things are starting to change."" 
Bishop Lionel Harvey from the First Baptist Cathedral of Westbury assured those gathered that hope will prevail. 
""I know that we are going to have faith over fear, I know that we are going to have love over hate,"" he said amid a steady and chilly wind. ""I know that as we continue to press toward the mark and keep focused, a place of agreement is always a place of power."" 
Wong, the high school student, and a second generation Chinese American, ended her remarks with a plea for change. 
""A single candle can [light] one person but 1,000 can light a path for everyone,"" she said. ""I implore you to be the spark that change

"Rallying against Asian hate: Demonstrators in Great Neck march, speak out","Zou, Dandan",Others,2021-04-12,"Rain-soaked demonstrators walked down Middle Neck Road in Great Neck on Sunday afternoon chanting ""Stop Asian Hate"" in a march to condemn the surge of anti-Asian attacks in recent months that have triggered fear, outrage and calls for action. 
""A lot of people in my community are scared,"" said Great Neck North High School sophomore Anjelica Wu, 16, a Chinese American who organized the rally. ""I wanted to make people know that their feelings are validated. Other people are feeling the same thing. We need to come together as a matter of sharing not just our fear but also our thoughts and ways to improve the situation."" 
With a bullhorn in hand, Wu and others led the hourlong march from Great Neck's Firefighters Park to the Village Green and Rose Garden in a procession made up of about 40 people, mostly high school students and their parents, who held up signs and chanted ""hate is a virus; we are not a virus."" 
Sunday's march was the latest event on Long Island to condemn anti-Asian hate, following a vigil earlier this month and two large rallies last month in Mineola and Hauppauge. The Great Neck Chinese Association said it will host a unity rally on April 25 at the same Firefighters Park on Grace Avenue. 
Before the march started, Rosanna Gao, 16, a junior at Great Neck South High School, spoke in front of the crowd of the Model Minority myth and perpetual outsider stereotype Asian Americans faced. The Great Neck South High school student also criticized the hyper-sexualized portrayal of Asian women in Hollywood movies and the media. 
""I'm not your virus. I'm not your Model Minority. I'm not your fetish. I'm not your scapegoat. I'm human,"" Gao said, 
Parents who attended the rally said demonstrating on the streets of their own community returns a sense of control back to the teenagers who have struggled with social isolation during the pandemic and a sense of powerlessness in light of the anti-Asian violence. 
""With COVID, the kids feel a lack of power. There's not a lot they can do than to stay remote,"" said Anjelica's father, James Wu. ""They also feel vulnerable to the pandemic and then the rise of anti-Asian violence where people are being attacked for no reason. This makes them feel empowered, like they are making a difference in the world."" 
Lawrence Tao, 18, believed rallies at least bring attention to the matter. 
The Great Neck North junior said he was furious when he watched videos of Asian elders being pushed and shoved on the street. Tao, who moved to the United States from China six years ago, said a fellow student called him ""coronavirus"" in school last year before schools closed to slow the spread of the virus. 
""In our culture, we are taught that when something bad happened, you should just let it go,"" Tao said in Mandarin. ""But we need to stand up and speak up.""",2827
When you realize no one is coming to save you: Wave of anti-Asian violence strikes at the core of one woman's thoughts on safety and life in America.,Annette S.L. Evans ,Others,2021-04-18,"I thought I was safe. I have always lived what seemed like a ""nice life,"" in nice neighborhoods - currently just outside West Chester with a nice professional job using my nice professional degree.
Even though I cultivated a second career teaching self-defense skills, my personal sense of danger was largely theoretical and revolved around being a woman. Recently, especially in the last year, I've learned how wrong I was that it was my Asian hair and eyes more than my gender that would put me at very real risk, and that it is vital for me to share effective personal protection strategies with the AAPI community too. 
As a Chinese American woman born to immigrants from Hong Kong, I knew I was an outsider in the small, Upstate New York town where I grew up, but the differences seemed benign. The teasing I endured from classmates didn't seem racially motivated, just cruel. As an adult, I dropped the foreign parts of my name and lost my native Cantonese language skills, feeling more American with every step. I rarely worried about being Asian. The times I was heckled with racist insults were few and far between. I lived a life free from threats of racist violence. 
My gender, small stature, and periods of single life seemed more likely to attract harassment and crime. They were why I learned how to shoot guns, to fight using Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and otherwise defend myself against all of the normal sorts of threats that women worry about. In time, they were why I founded On Her Own, a social media project where I share what I've learned about how women can survive and thrive in today's world. 
My feeling of racial belonging started changing when ""kung flu"" went from joke to popular vernacular during the COVID-19 pandemic last year. It lurched when my college roommate told me how a random white woman hurled racist insults at her and her daughter while they were shopping one day. As the wave of anti-Asian crime swelled in early 2021, I became increasingly concerned. These people around the country being assaulted and attacked with increasing levels of violence looked like me, like my family. Yet there was barely any attention from the media and authorities did too little to condemn these acts. My fears intensified when eight people were killed in metro Atlanta, including six women of Asian descent. 
I think and write extensively about the distinction between feeling safe and being safe. The feeling of safety, and the emotional peace it brings, is sometimes illusory. I often discuss how to identify when danger is lurking in the wings and how to prepare for its reality. So it's been disquieting to find myself caught in a trap like one I've often wamed others about: my feeling of being safely American enough blinded me from my precarious position as someone who at any moment could be deemed an enemy outsider, free to be attacked. I once would have thought that paranoia, yet here we are. 
One tenet of my personal protection philosophy is that in that moment of gravest extreme, you must assume you are on your own. No one is coming to save you. That assumption is so core to my beliefs that it is embodied in the name I work under: On Her Own. 
It has never felt more true to me than now, when I have at times had to beg the people around me to recognize the danger that I and those who look like me are in today. When I see AAPI leaders shouting for our history and experiences to be heard and honored. When I leap on the crumbs of official affirmation that our plight is seen and that it matters, because I don't expect more than those crumbs. 
As a woman, I find it socially difficult at times to embrace aggressiveness and the willingness to struggle for my own survival and my own flourishing. The burden of my cultural baggage, of being the good and quiet Chinese girl who doesn't make waves, adds to that difficulty, but current events make it even more important for me to fight for my life and to teach others who look like me to do the same. 
As an advocate for women's safety, I fight for gun rights. I also fight for the use of high-quality pepper spray, for effective physical fighting skills, for eloquent ways to talk myself out of danger, for firm boundary-setting. Now, every one of those strategies for personal safety is as important to me as an Asian American who sees that nobody is coming to save me. That's why I'm asking that support for the AAPI community include not just helping us feel safe through words of support, but helping us ensure access to the tools and abilities that make it possible for us to be safe. 
We need to make more educational resources, online and in person, available to AAPI communities, and they need to be tailored to teach people of all ages and abilities, in their native languages. We need to preserve and expand access to effective tools, including firearms and pepper spray, so that we can defend ourselves without relying on others to show up in time. 
I'm doing some of this work, and willing to do more. Will you help too?

"Filipino, 65, brutally attacked, carjacked in Oakland",None,Others,2021-04-19,"Manila, April 19 – A 65-year-old Filipino was brutally attacked and carjacked at gunpoint outside a restaurant in Oakland, California on Thursday. 
The victim was allegedly attacked at gunpoint outside a FoodMaxx grocery store on Thursday afternoon, according to a report from NBC Bay Area News. 
The victim was injured after he resisted when the suspect tried to steal his car. He was brought to Highland Hospital where he was treated for non-life-threatening injuries. 
The victim works as a driver for Lyft and relies on his car for his sole source of income. 
""He was hit over the head with a gun and he was trying to stop him from taking his car. So, he put his body to get in the way of getting inside the vehicle and the person took off with his car and dragged his body in the parking lot,"" Sara Guillermo, the victim's niece, told NBC Bay Area. 
""While they were trying to steal his car, they thought he was Chinese, so they were talking about COVID and being an Asian American in America,"" she said. 
Police have yet to determine whether the attack was a hate crime. 
The suspect remains at large as of this writing. 
The suspect stole a white Toyota Corolla with California license plate ""8GMA097."" Authorities are asking for help from the public in locating the suspect and the stolen car.

Suspect detained after Asian American woman fatally stabbed while walking dogs,"Deese, Kaelan",Others,2021-04-04			,"Police arrested a suspect in connection to the fatal stabbing Saturday of an Asian American woman who was walking her dogs in Riverside, California. 
Police responded to reports of the attack at about 7:30 a.m. local time, a Riverside Police Department spokesman wrote in a news release. 
The victim was identified as Ke Chieh Meng, 64, of Riverside. She was found on the ground bleeding from her abdomen after sustaining severe stab wounds, officer Ryan Railsback said. 
Meng was taken to a local medical facility where she died due to her wounds.

After Meng was pronounced dead, neighbor witnesses near the scene told officials about a ""transient woman"" walking through their yard and acting suspicious, police said. 
Authorities later located and detained a woman they identified as Darlene Stephanie Montoya, 23, who is a transient from Monterey Park. 
A preliminary investigation revealed Meng was walking her two small dogs on Golden Avenue on Saturday when she was ""randomly confronted and attacked by the transient woman,"" police said in the news release. 
The suspect stabbed Meng and fled the scene, police said. 
Detectives determined Montoya was the attacker and arrested her, later booking her into the Robert Presley Detention Center. 
She is charged with murder, weapons violation, and suspicion of being under the influence of an illegal substance. 
Montoya is being held without bail. Riverside Police said she was arrested once earlier in the week after she attacked a woman with a skateboard. 
The earlier incident resulted in Montoya being booked into jail for assault with a deadly weapon. Due to the emergency bail schedule amid the coronavirus pandemic, police said she was released on a ""Notice to Appear"" citation. 
Authorities said they initially believed Saturday's attack was a random occurrence but later said the incident is still under investigation. 
Crimes against Asian Americans are on the rise. They spiked 150% throughout 2020, which coincides with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, leading some high-profile people, including former President Donald Trump, to call it the ""China virus.""

I managed to walk a few blocks to Brooklyn Hospital, where doctors there saved my life. The NYPD did not label my attack a hate crime, but New York state Assembly member Ron Kim (D-Queens) called a press conference to denounce anti-Asian hate and violence. 
""The current wave of AAPI attacks is nothing new. Because Asians have always been stereotyped as perpetual foreigners, our well-being has always been a function of America's relationship with Asian nations. The big lie of American racism is that if you do everything right and play by the rules, you will be accepted in this country. But the U.S. throughout its history has consistently betrayed this 'model minority' myth, used by the right wing to drive a wedge between AAPIs and our natural Black, Indigenous and people of color allies. We are painfully reminded once again that white supremacy can never be defeated by accommodation, only through organized opposition and progressive activism."" 
Margaret Cho 
Actress and comedian 
""For me as an Asian-American artist, comedian, actor, it's really more about noninclusion. It's really about being very invisible within Hollywood, within the media, and it's hard to kind of understand how to even talk about invisibility because it's, like, invisible. It's very weird when you're just excluded from the conversation and you're trying to be in an industry that doesn't see you. It's the most insidious kind of racism because it's this feeling of nonexistence. It combines erasure with 
a kind of gaslighting that we don't matter or we don't make any impression. And the truth is, we've made a huge contribution to American life. We've been here since 1849, yet still somehow we are seen as 'other,' or not part of America, so this has to change. 
""I was a resident of Atlanta for seven years. I know exactly all of those spas and the neighborhoods and the communities. They're very familiar to me. The fact that law enforcement was really bending over backwards to try to humanize the murderer was really disturbing. And not categorizing this as a hate crime is part of the problem. 
""You don't ask somebody who's committed a hate crime whether or not it's a hate crime. It's not something that's up to their opinion.... It is a hate crime when you're targeting Asian women who you say make you feel a certain way so you're 
--- 
going to kill them. Why would he specifically seek out Asian spas, Asian-owned spas, Asian-run spas in three different locations in order to kill Asian women if race isn't a factor? That to me is clearly a hate crime against Asians and Asian women in particular. It has nothing to do with sex addiction. Lots of people are saying these are sex workers. I was a sex worker. I know what sex work is. This to me seems more likeskin care and aestheticians. The women were mostly 50, 60, 70. This was not a typical idea of what people think of as sex workers or Asian sex workers. The framing of this as a crime by a sex addict who wanted to kill sex workers, it's not exactly that. There's a lot of projection happening onto this crime that has to do with the inherent racism that exists in society around Asian 
women.

""I try really hard to look at these kinds of things in a big-picture kind of way. Even though it's very hard when you are part of the group that's either being targeted or subject to these incidents. In my lifetime, I don't really remember it being quite like this: Where the conversation that ensues is a really positive and important one. But the pain that it is in response to is incredibly intense. Asian people are really known for a kind of reservation when it comes to calling attention to themselves and their problems in a somewhat cultural way. And that's a very broad statement - of course there are plenty of Asian-American people who do not do this - but equally I think there's a tradition of choosing to let things slide. For me what it is is kind of watching people in my community - who I think of as very strong and very able to be resilient - to see them really challenged by these events is very worrisome. And your heart breaks for them. Because it's also unnecessary. I don't understand who has it in them to actually push an old lady in the street."" 
Jason Wu 
Designer"" I often ask myself why I have not spoken up about this topic in the past. It is perhaps due to my Asian upbringing where we were taught to keep our heads down, work hard and avoid confrontation. I believe it is now time to bring all of the underlying issues to the surface and for us to speak up and acknowledge the grossly overlooked history of racism against the AAPI communit"". 
I spent most of my life being insecure about myself because the Western standard of beauty has always reigned supreme. As a proud Asian man today, I am done with being silent and the 'model minority' - the time for action is n❞w.

""I immigrated to the United States when I was 6 years old and life was incredibly difficult, mainly because my parents were constantly working, and I started first grade without knowing any English. I was called names, had my facial features mocked, and sometimes was pushed or hit. I once even had my eyeglasses stomped on by a classmate"" 
As I learned English and made friends, the overt racism and physical bullying subsided, but (it) transformed into an undercurrent of racism and microaggressions that I still feel to this day.

Xenophobic violence against the Asian community is not new. I'm tired of witnessing me or my friends' Asian culture be the brunt of jokes. I'm tired of reading headlines of senseless mass shootings directed toward my community. I'm tired of feeling immense pain when thinking about the families who have unexpectedly and undeservingly lost their loved ones. I think this rise in hate crimes should be a catalyst for everyone to do research and start conversations to help fix this long-standing pro""lem. 
Ali Ewoldt 
Broadway star"" As an actor, I am grateful that I can help generate understanding and empathy for the characters I play, historical and fictional. As an actor of mixed race (Filipino and white), I acknowledge that my somewhat ambiguous features have allowed me to play a variety of roles that may not have been available to my fully Asian counterparts. But I know that it was seeing Lea Salonga, a fellow Filipina, play Eponine in 'Les Miserables' on Broadway when I was a child that inspired me to believe that I, too, could maybe have a career in musical th""a er. 
This importance of representation was reinforced when I became the first Asian-American to play Christine in The Phantom of the Opera' on Broadway after nearly 29 years of exclusively white Christines. I received letters, messages online and greetings at the stage door from young people who had previously felt excluded from opportunities like playing classic leading roles on Broadway because they were of Asian des""ent.

""When I went to elementary school in Virginia, the first day of class was always a major source of stress for me because every single one of my new teachers would pronounce my last name like, 'Chow.' I would then have to politely correct him/her, but the embarrassment and shame that I felt when all the eyes of the entire class turned to look at me was almost unbearable"" 
To this day, I still don't understand how learned adults pronounced my name that way, but I chalk it up to innocent ignorance. But what happened to me a couple of weeks ago at the 23rd St. subway station wasn't innocent. While waiting for the R train on a pretty deserted end of the platform, I heard a guy walking towards me who started yelling, 'Six feet, b--h, si"" fet!' 
I dared not look up, I was scared. 'Was he talking to me? Was he screaming what I thought he was screaming to ME?' He hollered those words again, so I began walking the opposite way, passing him quickly while staring intently down at my phone. 'Please don't do anything to me,' I prayed. I was terrified he might push me into the tracks because there have been a few such incidents reported recently in the news.

It's been immensely painful, yet not surprising to watch this surge in unfounded and targeted hatred towards Asians, especially the elderly and women. If there was ever an opportunity to overcome our differences and come together as a collective humanity, this pandemic was it. And yet, once again, so many have chosen to give into fear, depravity and have followed mindless hateful political rhetoric. These destructive voices are only getting louder, and have amplified this state of emergency that America has been in for so long. What so many people in America still don't want to see is that America stands on the shoulders of immigrants, and that its beauty lies in its diversity. Alienating and othering people will eventually leave America standing empty, all alone and devoid of it"" soul.

Although we are not a monolith - there are 48 countries in Asia - we are a large continent. And we are holding ourselves together. But I also wanna say that a lot of what is happening is not brand new this is not an aberration. This is not just because of COVID. This is just not because there was a president that was xenophobic. This has been happening for a long time. Like the way the dehumanization of Asians and Asian-Americans in this country, and particularly in the Western world, but particularly in this country. I want to encourage Asian-Americans to actually think about those values that we were taught that no longer serve us. Right? The values of like don't say anything, head down, just keep on working. That contributed to our invisibility, that contributed to us not being seen as human beings. Say something. Express your pain. Express your feelings. ",14828
Stabbed 'out of nowhere' ; Asian-American man loses kidney in possible hate crime,"Thomas, Tracy; Gartland, Michael; Rayman, Graham",Others,2021-02-27,"An Asian man stabbed near a Manhattan courthouse needed to have a kidney surgically removed after the
random attack that is now being considered a hate crime, police sources said.
Cops initially said there was no indication of bias in the 6:20 p.m. Thursday stabbing, but later upgraded
charges against Salman Muflihi, 23, to attempted murder as a hate crime and assault as a hate crime.
The victim's wife does not believe hate was the main reason for the crime.
""He's obviously mentally ill,"" she told the Daily News on Friday evening at the loft building where the couple
lives in Chinatown.
""We are concerned that someone so mentally ill is walking around the city,"" said the wife, who asked that her
name not be used. ""Why wasn't he evaluated before this?""
Muflihi, from Brooklyn, said nothing to the 36-year-old victim as he stabbed him from behind with the 8-inch
blade by the Daniel Patrick Moynihan U.S. Courthouse.
Moments later he confessed his crime to security outside the Manhattan District Attorney's Office on Hogan
Place, saying, ""I just stabbed someone. Where are the police at?"" said sources.
Muflihi told cops that he lunged because he didn't like the way the victim looked at him.
Investigators believe he was emotionally disturbed, sources said.
""How could they have exchanged looks?"" the victim's wife asked. ""It was too dark. He came up from behind and
said nothing.""
The victim - who police said was on his way home - stumbled and dropped to the sidewalk. Two passersby called
911 and medics rushed him to Bellevue Hospital.
His wife said his condition was stable. The knife damaged vital organs including his liver and his right kidney,
which had to be removed in surgery, sources said.
""This could happen to any of us. It could happen to you, your family, anyone,"" the victim's wife said. ""He's a
good man. He's an innocent person who was randomly attacked.""
Mayor de Blasio condemned the attack during a Friday press briefing, pointing to a spike in hate crimes against
Asian-Americans.
""Even as we're sounding the alarm and calling for people to band together to stop hate, we had a horrible
incident yesterday, a horrible act of violence against an Asian-American man - out of nowhere, just pure
hatred,"" de Blasio said.
""The suspect has been apprehended. We're hoping and praying for this man as he fights for his life,"" he added.
Police have recorded 28 incidents of ""COVID-related"" hate crimes against Asians since the start of the pandemic
- a sharp increase from the pre-pandemic period.
Muflihi - who was also charged with carrying a fake driver's license and illegal possession of a weapon - was
awaiting arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court.
He was previously arrested on Jan. 12 for punching a 28-year-old Asian man in the back of the head and
throwing him to the ground at a Sunset Park, Brooklyn grocery store.

"Shutdowns, attacks create subdued New Year",None,Others,2021-02-14,"Festivities for the Lunar New Year holiday, normally East Asia's busiest tourism season, are muted after China,
Vietnam, Taiwan and other governments tightened travel curbs and urged the public to avoid big gatherings
following renewed coronavirus outbreaks.
In China, Buddhist and Daoist temples that are usually packed with holiday worshippers are closed. Streets in
major cities were largely empty.
Ji Jianping, 62, was among those gathering outside the locked gates of the Tibetan-style Lama Temple on
Beijing's north side to burn incense and pray. She said she and her family skipped visiting their home town in
the northern province of Shanxi due to the pandemic.
The government's appeal to China's public to avoid travel is denting spending on tourism and gifts. But
economists say the overall impact might be limited if factories, shops and factories keep operating instead of
taking their usual two-week break.
The commerce ministry said 48 million more people in Chinese cities planned to celebrate where they lived
instead of travelling.
The China State Railway Group said railway journeys were down by almost 70 per cent from last year.
Departures from Beijing's two major airports were down 75 per cent.
In Taiwan, merchants said sales were up 10 to 20 per cent because people were celebrating at home with family
dinners instead of travelling abroad.
Meanwhile, police are stepping up patrols and volunteers are increasing their street presence after several
violent attacks on older Asians that have stoked fear in San Francisco Bay Area Chinatowns and subdued the
Lunar New Year mood.
Shops and restaurants are typically bustling in Chinatowns across the United States at this time of year, but the
pandemic and safety concerns have dampened the festive atmosphere.
City officials have visited Chinatowns in San Francisco and Oakland this week to address residents' safety
concerns and condemn the violence. They have vowed to combat a problem that has been simmering since the
start of the pandemic but sparked new outrage after two unprovoked attacks were caught on video within a few
days.
In one, a man shoved Vicha Ratanapakdee to the ground as he was taking his morning walk in San Francisco's
Anza Vista neighbourhood on January 28. The 84-year-old Thai man's head struck the pavement, and he later
died in hospital. Prosecutors have charged a 19-year-old with murder and elder abuse.
On January 31, a security camera caught a man wearing a hooded sweatshirt barrelling into a 91-year-old Asian
man in Oakland's Chinatown, causing him to fall face down on to the footpath. Police have arrested a suspect,
and said he had assaulted a couple on the same block later that day, and another on February 1.
In just the last two weeks, authorities had recorded 18 crimes against Asian-Americans around Oakland's
Chinatown, said Nancy O'Malley, district attorney for Alameda County.
The recent attacks represent the latest spike in verbal and physical attacks against Asian- Americans since the
coronavirus, which emerged in China, reached the US. Stop AAPI Hate, launched by two advocacy groups to
encourage Asian-Americans to report such incidents, has documented more than 3000 attacks to date.
The California attacks have prompted volunteers to offer to walk older residents to their cars or homes after
shopping. Jacob Azevedo said more than 200 people signed up after he posted the idea on social media. They
also donated thousands of dollars to help him buy personal alarms for older Asians. - AP

"THE BLING QUEEN AND HER LITTLE EMPEROR: She's the star of Bling Empire, a new reality show about super-rich Asians living large in LA. Christine Chiu tells Megan Agnew about plastic surgery, Prince Charles and the pressures of marrying into a Chinese dynasty",None,Others,2021-02-14,"Christine Chiu hadn't expected a knock on the bedroom door on her wedding night. The visitor was her new mother-inlaw, whom after a whirlwind engagement she had met for only the first time that day. In her
hands was a ""gigantic"" book, and what was written inside was also unexpected: proof that her new husband, Dr Gabriel Chiu, a renowned Los Angeles-based plastic surgeon, was ""the 24th generation direct
descendant of the Song dynasty"".
The suggestion was that Gabriel, king of Beverly Hills' boobs and bottoms, would have been the sovereign of a vast Chinese empire had it not been overthrown in the 13th century. It came as a surprise to
Christine, who was born in Taiwan but grew up in California. She knew little about
ancient Chinese dynasties. Her mother-inlaw took her through hundreds of years of male emperors listed in the book, and their progeny. At the end was her husband's name, followed by an empty space. ""It is
very important that you do not let us down,"" she was told. The family wanted a male heir to continue the line.
Christine, then 24, and Gabriel, 15 years her senior, started trying for a baby emperor at their Bel Air home. But she couldn't get pregnant. They did rounds and rounds of IVF, with different techniques and
different doctors ? the best that money could buy. A decade passed and still there was no heir. ""I just saw that empty space I was supposed to fill,"" Christine says. ""That was my job, that is the one thing they
asked of me, that was my value."" At family gatherings she was made to sit at the children's table and wash the dishes, all the while harbouring the secret that it was actually her husband who
had fertility problems. She silently ""bore his shame"" for 11 years. Eventually, in 2018, she gave birth to Gabriel Christian Chiu III, or ""Baby G"" as they call him. He arrived chubby-cheeked, dressed in Versace and
ready to rule his imaginary kingdom.
Now 38, Christine is one of the stars and producers of Bling Empire, the latest Netflix docuseries to adopt the tried-and-tested formula of following the seemingly vacuous lives and eye-popping consumption of a
group of super-rich friends. The difference is that this show has an all-Asian cast. It's Crazy Rich Asians meets Keeping Up with the Kardashians ? solid gold trash but with layers of cultural intrigue; yes, it's about
cash, cars, clothes and plastic surgery, but it's also about the balance ? and tension ? between therapised, liberal life in LA and east Asian traditions and responsibilities.
""These are stories of infertility, surrogacy, parenthood ? difficult topics across any ethnicity, but set against the backdrop of very traditional eastern expectations there is an additional layer of complexity,"" says
Christine, speaking from her home office in Bel Air. She says she's dressed in Loro Piana cashmere ""sweats"", which cost about £1,800 each, but doesn't want to turn on her video. ""Nothing glamorous. I'm first a
mom, then a businesswoman, then a personality and producer,"" she says. ""On TV screens Asian faces and perspectives are underrepresented, so the show was an opportunity I couldn't pass up.""
Usually dripping in ""high jewellery"", she is presented as the self-made, ponytailswinging mean girl of the series, the couture queen of Beverly Hills, never shy of putting on an ostentatious show of wealth or
mentioning her (considerable) philanthropic pursuits ? and her acquaintance with the Prince of Wales.
Christine and her husband, who are worth a reported £80 million through their private clinic, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery, are the main backers of the Prince's Foundation Health & Wellbeing Centre at Dumfries
House in East Ayrshire, Scotland, which uses complementary therapies to help locals with obesity, loneliness and depression. Two of its health lodges are named after none other than Baby G. The same Baby G
who, in one episode of Bling
Empire, is photographed for his preschool admission portrait, at the age of one, dressed in a tuxedo, sitting upright in a miniature sports car as $100 bills rain down.
Christine's nemesis in the show is Anna Shay, 60, a withering matriarch figure to the younger cast members. She's the eccentric daughter of the late arms dealer Edward Shay, whose company was sold by Anna
and her brother to Lockheed Martin for a reported $1.2 billion in cash in 2006.
Shay shops for diamonds as though they are sweets, throws dinner parties as though they are tests of allegiance and sounds lonely ? she met her best friend over the counter of her favourite jewellery house in
Paris. She trusts few people ? particularly not Christine, whom she appears to view as a name-dropping, nouveau riche pretender.
The two are set up as frozen-faced frenemies. In one episode Christine is moved to the wrong end of the dinner table for wearing a diamond necklace that Shay also owns. ""I mean, I was seated to the left of
Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace earlier this year,"" Christine complains. Shay is unfussed. ""I do find it odd that she wants to compete with me,"" she purrs. ""But she cannot compete with what I was born into.""
""There are certainly discussions on new money versus old money,"" Christine tells me when I ask about the characters' different attitudes towards wealth. ""I'm of a younger generation, so I am more open to
speaking about consumption. But I don't do it in a way of boasting. I know the show is edited in that way, unfortunately, because people are hooked by the bling and the glitz, but for me I look at luxury
consumption as an investment and a preservation of really important pieces of art."" She adds: ""I hate to say it, but I don't think there's older money than dynastic money.""
When pushed, Christine is unsure what proportion of her in-laws' wealth is ""dynastically related"", but she knows they do ""very, very well"" in property. Why, then, does the family place so much emphasis on its links
to the Song dynasty? Isn't it all a bit pretentious?
""I don't think anyone really cares about or traces dynasties and I try to downplay that,"" she says. ""But I also don't want to disrespect someone's heritage ? it's just being proud
of where they are from. To me and my husband and our everyday life it has no relevance. What is a big deal is that my husband is a good father, an excellent surgeon and a beautiful human being.""
Gabriel Chiu was born in Hong Kong and moved to the US as a child. He has a ""traditional"" family, very private and ""anything but boastful, you would never know they have so much money"", Christine says. The
couple met while working at a large medical corporation: he was a senior plastic surgeon, the ""star of the company"", and she was a vice-president of marketing.
""I thought there was a lot of untapped potential,"" she says. ""I was looking at him, thinking, this is a man who clearly cares about his craft and his work more than he cares about the profit, but I think in the right
setting we can really have it all. We can give patients the most elevated experience and he can be recognised for it.""
After their marriage in 2006 Christine decided to set up a plastic surgery practice, with herself as the managing director and Gabriel as lead surgeon. ""He was my first employee,"" she says. They launched their
clinic using funds from Gabriel's family as well as money of their own. ""For a long time his family called it his very expensive hobby. They were very much on board, no expense was spared. The truth is, we didn't
make a profit [at the beginning] but it didn't matter because every morning he woke up and he was excited, approaching every patient like it was his canvas. I mean, he had a bottomless account to tap into to
make it the very best it can be and, in the journey of doing that, things caught fire and we grew.""
Christine herself comes from a ""very financially comfortable background"". Her parents were successful in business, moving from Taiwan to California when she was five. She struggled at school, speaking
only Mandarin at first. ""There was a class that taught Hispanic kids how to speak English, so I joined that,"" she says. She had to learn Spanish in order to learn English. ""I was very much made fun of. I've had my
fair share of bullying. I went to three high schools and it wasn't easy.""
She says her parents wanted to keep her grounded, emphasising the importance of having a job. ""My husband and I grew up in
affluency, and both sides went out of their way to make sure we built a strong work ethic."" She had a trust fund, but was cut offfrom it because she ""didn't do exactly what my parents wanted me to do at some
point"". She is guarded on this and won't say exactly why. That's all ancient history, however, as today the Chius' clinic is ""enormously profitable"". With more than 35,000 patients it's the go-to place for celebrities
and the super-rich. She won't name names.
Covid, she says, has caused a ""Zoom boom"" in plastic surgery. The more people are looking at their faces on a screen, the more treatments they want. ""People are putting the money they would have spent on a
big vacation back into their body. Before, they would chip away at their bucket list of things to get done, but during Covid
people are just getting it all done at once because they can recover at home and hide.""
The clinic offers a ""mommy makeover"", which can include a breast lift, liposuction and tummy tuck. ""In many cases"", reads the website, ""women who have taken perfect care of their bodies feel trapped in their
sagging or stretched skin as their self-confidence diminishes.""
There is an argument, I suggest, that plastic surgeons reinforce people's insecurities rather than curing them. There is nothing more validating ? and crushing ? than someone in a white coat telling you that you
have bingo wings and a flat arse. ""There are a lot of surgeons who would just do it all ? take the money and just do it.
With Dr Chiu, he is definitely on the more natural side. He will talk people out of surgeries,"" she says.
I ask about her own list of regular treatments. ""Ironically I'm very needlephobic,"" she admits. Her husband had to hire an anaesthesiologist to sedate her just
so she could have Botox. Now, though, they have a machine called a Pro-Nox. ""It's nitrous oxide,"" she says ? laughing gas ? ""and I breathe into it, then he [Gabriel] puts in some Botox and filler.""
Instagram is her playground. On it she leads, by her own admission, a ""frivolous, materialistic"" lifestyle. As a child she was not allowed dolls, only books ? ""just black and white and ink for me"" ? because her
parents wanted her to focus on her studies. In traditional Asian culture, she says, when a woman gets married she leaves her old family and joins a new one. ""My late twenties were like a new chapter for me. It
was my chance to relive all these suppressed little girl fantasies I had. And I really went for it.""
She began bingeing on couture and today tries to buy one piece from every fashion show she attends ? sometimes costing six figures apiece. However, although she looked as if she were living the Californian
dream on Instagram, behind the scenes she was going through increasingly invasive IVF treatment, ""burning out"" her body.
""I can see how [my husband's parents] were looking at my life from the outside and thinking, this girl doesn't want to be a mom, she just wants to wear her designer clothing and travel."" The pressure was building
on her to have a son, with her in-laws blaming her body and health. ""In the eastern Asian culture you don't talk back [to elders]. It's just how it goes. So I would say, 'I'm sorry, I'm trying, I will do better, I
promise.' "" Didn't she mind carrying the can for her husband's infertility ? an issue that she says stemmed from ""a medical problem he had from when he was very young"" ? for 11 years? ""I really don't know what
my in-laws' response would have been if I'd said it wasn't me. I don't know if they would have accepted it. It's a very east Asian expectation for the wife to protect the husband and to protect the family. It was my
duty and my role. I wasn't OK with it, but I knew that's what I had to do.""
At one point the couple considered using a sperm donor and smuggling a biologically illegitimate heir past Gabriel's family. ""I remember looking at these photos of donors and thinking, could this pass off[as
Gabriel]? Then I remember thinking, they would DNA the baby, there's no way we could pull this off.""
Christine thought she was going to take the secret of her husband's fertility issues with her to the grave, until it ""blurted"" out of her mouth as the Bling Empire cameras were rolling. Her husband discusses it on
camera too. She says she is talking about it now in order to push against Asian expectations of privacy and, as a result, ease
the shame. Huge numbers of people have got in touch with her as a result.
""I didn't realise that so many Asian women were undergoing IVF ? whether it's because of male or female infertility.
We're in the same boat, feeling the pain and pressure from in-laws and parents."" She hasn't spoken to her own in-laws about whether they have seen the show. She's hoping they have not.
Now two and a half, Baby G is their ""miracle"" child and Christine is out of ""the doghouse"" with the Chiu family. Still, she wants to make sure that her son retains his Chinese and Taiwanese identity and the intimacy
with his grandparents' culture, while embracing the Californian values that resonate with her. ""I still feel confined by tougher eastern expectations. I don't think I get to enjoy the casual vulnerability of a typical
Californian. But I want Baby G to grow up knowing it's OK to be mad and struggle and talk about things openly.""
Naturally Baby G has a trust fund, but Christine says he must ""build his own
legacy and not measure success by money"". The naming of the two lodges at the Prince's Foundation Health & Wellbeing Centre in his honour was their seven-month birthday present to him. (""I have to say we
have been longtime supporters and fans of Prince Charles for his commitment and dedication to his people and his country,""
she gushes. ""He's just a really remarkable man, and so funny too! Really witty ? he has the best sense of humour."") For Baby G's first birthday, the couple made a $1 million donation in his name to the Cayton
Children's Museum in Santa Monica. It was announced at a birthday party that boasted circus performers, a ten-course meal and an arcade claw machine that picked out Gucci presents.
According to Christine, Baby G spoke sign language before he was a year old, and today is learning Mandarin, French and English. During the recent Covid lockdowns the Chius have converted a portion of their
guesthouse into a school and hired a tutor. Baby G is taught a broad curriculum that includes drawing, painting, global music, drumming, sound healing
and yoga. In the afternoons they tend to the vegetable patch in order to teach him about sustainability or hang out with the llamas, borrowed from a rescue programme after Baby G was ""naturally drawn to
them"".
Despite all this, Christine insists she is no ""tiger mom"". ""I don't think it was my parents' intention, but it was very much implied that I wasn't good enough,"" she says. ""My A was not good enough because I should
have gotten an A-plus. But I think it's the wrong type of push. My son should know he's good enough already.""
The show's grotesque excesses aside, Christine believes Bling Empire will have a positive impact on perceptions of east Asians in America, and on notions of beauty. ""People are considering [us] beautiful, when all
I wanted as a child was to be blonde and have blue eyes. It is very heartwarming."" But she is aware acceptance is fragile and racism is rife. In the past year President Trump repeatedly called Covid-19 the
""Chinese virus"", which many believe was the reason for a sharp increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans.
Initially Chiu thought the wave of discrimination wouldn't affect her, living in culturally diverse Los Angeles. But one Sunday morning this year at a farmers' market two white men started yelling at Baby G. ""My
husband and I had masks and sunglasses on ? it was questionable whether or not we were Asian ? but Baby G only had a mask on. They were calling
him the 'China virus' and telling him to go home and take this virus with him. I was shocked that there was still that much hatred. It woke me up because I thought we were insulated, being in LA, but we're not.""
I tell her about a text a friend of mine sent me about Bling Empire before our interview: ""I am OBSESSED!!!!"" She is Chinese-British and the show struck a chord with her. ""It's such an amazing portrayal of what
it's like to be Asian (obviously not the financial side) but of the importance of family life,"" my friend wrote. ""I find it the most relatable programme I've ever watched, even though they are so different to me. It
really hit home with the things I've experienced. I know that for my mum, for example, the more westernised we got, the further we drifted from her. It's really hard.""
Chiu understands. Since the death of her mother last year she has started to reconnect with long-lost family members back in Taiwan. ""I am reviving some cultural aspects of my background that were muted,"" she
says, but then stops herself. ""We are diving into questions that will be explored in season two, if there is one,"" she explains. ""I don't want to give away too many spoilers."" A reminder, if ever one was needed, that
her life is now a soap opera, and it's clear we have come to the end of my allotted episode n

Racial Violence Increases in New York and California,"White, Peter",Others,2021-02-25,"NASHVILLE, TN-Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thailand native who lived in San Francisco, died several
weeks ago after being shoved to the ground. Across the bay, another man injured three people in Oakland's
Chinatown neighborhood. According to CNN, the victims were a 91-year-old man, a 60-year-old man, and a 55-
year-old woman.
Last Tuesday in the Flushing neighborhood of New York City, a 52-year-old Chinese-American woman was
attacked outside a bakery. A man shoved her to the ground so hard she struck her head and passed out. The
same day, two Asian seniors were assaulted on the subway in separate incidents, according to NBC.
House Democrats last week denounced a spate of recent anti-Asian violence in California and New York. They
called for Congress and the White House to pass legislation to provide Department of Justice grants to states
and local governments to improve reporting of hate crimes.
They want to meet with the DOJ about enforcement and called for more support for victims. They said they
would hold hearings on the rise in racially motivated incidents.Three non-profits in San Francisco set up the Stop AAPI Hate campaign last year. They began tracking Anti-Asian hate incidents and found there have been nearly 3,000 incidents of anti-Asian discrimination across the
United States since March 2020. Incidents were reported from 47 states and the District of Columbia. Fifty-six
percent of incidents took place in either California or New York. Women experienced hate 2.3 times the rate of
men. Seven percent of respondents were seniors (60+).
""What we've seen over the past year is really an emergence of COVID-re-lated racism in the United States,"" said
Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director, Asian Pacific Policy & Planning Council.
Kulkarni said most of the racial incidents they reported were not nice but not all hate crimes. Verbal harassment
and name-calling were most common, followed by shunning, physical assault, and spitting. Most incidents took
place in a business, then on a sidewalk or public street, followed by public parks. Chinese were most targeted,
then Korean, Filipino, Vietnamese, and Japanese.
""Words matter. We cannot discount in which we had a full year in which we had a president and his colleagues
calling this virus the 'China virus', the 'Wuhan flu', and even worse derivations of that,"" said John C. Yang,
president of Asian Americans Advancing Justice (AAJC).
Yang noted a poll last year which found 40% of Asian Americans either experienced discrimination or heard
someone blame Asia or China for COVID-19. He said people are afraid of COVID-19 and afraid about loss of
income. Those are real fears but they've been conditioned to blame somebody else. Asians are easy targets.
""This fear that we have, this virus of racism is a virus that is very contagious and that affects all our
communities... and we need to fight that virus together,"" Yang said.
Advocates think tougher law enforcement towards hate crimes will help but won't solve the problem. That would
be sort of like playing Whack-a-Mole and doesn't get at the underlying causes. One, of course, is white
supremacy, but another one is inter-ethnic hostility.
""Rather than accept the premise that we're against one another... I think we need to look back at the Civil
Rights Movement and had it not been for Black leaders after the victories of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the
Voting rights Act, they said, 'you know what? No more to racial barriers in immigration',"" said Kulkarni.
They didn't have to say that. They didn't have to do that. But they did. And because of what they did many of
us, including my own family, is in the United States. So we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to those Civil
Rights leaders because without them we wouldn't be there.
So let's think about that and think about how we work together toward solutions rather than accept the premise
of white supremacy that is 'let's pit these groups against each other'
We have so much in common and we can work together for the right restorative and transformative justice
solutions. I think that's really what people are looking for- is this time healing rather than division,"" Kulkarni
said.

Rally vs. attacks on Asians,"Parnell, Wes; Goldiner, Dave",Others,2021-02-28,"A crowd of about 200 New Yorkers gathered Saturday in Foley Square to denounce a wave of anti-Asian violence
that they say is fueled by racism and ignorance about the COVID-19 pandemic.
The throng heard community leaders and a parade of top political leaders vow to end the shocking spat of
attacks and seemingly unending torment of slurs that have dramatically worsened during the pandemic.
""We are fighting a global pandemic but we are also fighting racism. ... We are getting spat on, shoved, punched,
slashed, stabbed,"" said Jo-Ann Yoo of the Asian American Federation. ""Right now Asian-Americans are scared,
we are outraged, and we are devastated.""
Mayoral candidate Andrew Yang, one of the nation's best-known Asian politicians, attended the rally but was not
given a speaking spot and left without speaking to reporters.
The crowd gave a rousing reception to Noel Quintana, 61, a Filipino-American who was slashed in the face on
the L train last week. ""A lot of Asian-Americans [are] being attacked everywhere so I just want [people] to know
that this is happening to us,"" he said. ""Almost every day there are attacks and I don't understand why.""
Many New Yorkers were stunned to see a viral video of an Asian-American woman being slammed to the
sidewalk last week in an unprovoked attack in Flushing, Queens.
Rep. Grace Meng (D-Queens) said the attacks are the tip of an iceberg of hate crimes, many of which go
unreported.
She vowed that Asian-Americans would no longer settle for being ""invisible"" victims.
""Too many people who are afraid to leave their homes,"" said Meng, whose district includes Flushing, ""not just
because of the virus, but because of bigotry.""
Asian-American leaders say they are regularly targeted for verbal and physical abuse by people who blame them
for the pandemic.
Many blame the racist violence in part on former President Donald Trump, who often called COVID-19 the ""China
virus"" or other racist terms because it was first identified in China.
Mayor de Blasio, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and state Attorney General Letitia James all vowed to crack down
on anti-Asian violence in New York, saying the city needs to protect people targeted by hatred.

"New York City Police Mobilize Against Rise in Hate Crimes Targeting Asians; NYPD officers are increasing patrols and investigations, as hate crimes against Asian-Americans have risen sharply during the pandemic","Chapman, Ben",Others,2021-02-23,"NYPD Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo, commanding officer of the Asian Hate Crime Task Force. PHOTO: Jose A. Alvarado Jr. for The Wall Street Journal
New York City is increasing police patrols and investigations to fight a rise in hate crimes targeting Asian people amid the coronavirus pandemic, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday.
Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said at a briefing that police would step up investigations and patrols of subway stations. There were 28 coronavirus-related hate crimes committed against Asian
people in New York City in 2020, compared with three such hate crimes in 2019, according to New York Police Department figures.
There have been two hate crimes against Asian residents in New York City so far this year, according to the NYPD, up from zero of such crimes during the same period last year.
The most recent incident occurred on Feb. 15, according to police officials, when an unknown assailant allegedly used hate speech against an Asian man in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood
before punching him and stealing his phone.
Video of a Feb. 16 attack on an older Asian woman in the Flushing section of Queens went viral on social media, prompting actress Olivia Munn to share the incident on Twitter, leading to an
arrest, according to NYPD officials.
Rise in Hate Crimes
* Violence Against Asian-Americans Raises Concern in Bay Area (Feb .12)
That incident, which hasn't been determined to be a hate crime by police, was widely cited by politicians and community leaders who have called on the city to step up its efforts to protect Asian
residents.
Mr. de Blasio said Tuesday the rise in hate crimes against Asian residents was driven by biases held by individuals who blame Chinese and other Asian people for Covid-19.
""From the very beginning, even before we had a single case in New York City, Asian American communities were suffering discrimination. Asian-American businesses saw their customers no
longer come,"" Mr. de Blasio said. ""It's been a very tough time for Asian communities.""
Mr. de Blasio said the NYPD's Asian Hate Crime Task Force would be ramping up investigations in response to the rise in hate crimes. Formed in October, the task force is the first-ever group
within the NYPD dedicated to investigating crimes targeting a single race.
Additionally, Mr. de Blasio said members of his Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes would be meeting with community leaders this week to discuss additional measures city officials can take
to address the issue.
NYPD Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo, who is commanding officer of the Asian Hate Crime Task Force, said at Tuesday's briefing that the group comprised 25 detectives of Asian backgrounds who
speak 11 Asian languages. The group's familiarity with the city's Asian communities is key to effective investigation, Mr. Loo said.
""We are here to guarantee there's a strong appropriate response to the hate that's infecting our city,"" said Mr. Loo. ""The task force consists of members that come from the community to serve
the community.""
Mr. Loo said that police have made arrests in 18 of the 28 hate crimes that occurred against Asian residents in 2020 and one arrest in the two cases that have occurred so far this year. Mr. Loo
said the character of the crimes that were committed varied, but in each case the perpetrator made a statement regarding the coronavirus or indicating bias against Asians.

'White Nationalism' Isn't American Minorities' Biggest Problem; Racial paranoia and taboos feed crime against Asians and black distrust of Covid-19 vaccinations.,"Riley, Jason L",Others,2021-02-23,"""End the violence toward Asians,"" said the promotional fliers. ""Let's unite against white nationalism.""
Demonstrators gathered in New York on Saturday in the wake of a spate of unprovoked violent attacks on Asian-Americans. Earlier this month, Noel Quintana, a 61-year-old native of
Manila, was slashed in the face with a box cutter while commuting to work on a crowded subway car. He survived but required about 100 stitches to close his wounds. Other victims have
been less fortunate.
In Milwaukee last September, a 36-year-old Hmong American named Ee Lee was sexually assaulted in a city park and died at a hospital from ""blunt force trauma to her head."" The
suspects fled on bicycles.
In San Francisco last month, Vicha Ratanapakdee, 84 and originally from Thailand, was on his regular morning walk when a passerby knocked him to the ground and ran away.
Ratanapakdee died from his injuries a few days later. Across the Bay, in Oakland's Chinatown, police have documented an uptick in assaults, particularly on the elderly. On Jan. 31, a man
was caught on camera in separate incidents approaching a 91-year-old man and 55-year-old woman from behind and shoving them to the pavement. The woman lost consciousness.
""It's not unique to Chinatown or to the Asian community, the increase in crime we've seen across the city and across the county,"" said the district attorney for Alameda County, which
includes Oakland, at a news conference earlier this month. ""But we have seen in the last several weeks and month a very specific increase in crimes committed against Asians.""
Some have attributed these attacks to the previous administration's coronavirus rhetoric, while others see them as part of a broader increase in crime rates during the pandemic. Maybe
it's both. What's harder to demonstrate is that these attacks stem from a rise in ""white nationalism,"" as that New York flier claims. Despite efforts to shoehorn such incidents into the left's
favorite political narrative, all the suspects in the attacks described above are black. There have been white-supremacist attacks on Asians, such as the 2012 shooting at a Sikh temple in
Wisconsin, which killed six. But are white nationalists responsible for blacks committing crimes against Asians?
Liberals continue to pretend that racism and prejudice are one-way streets—that only whites can be perpetrators, while blacks can only be victims. But criminals and victims come in all
colors. Surveillance cameras have caught young black men playing the so-called knockout game, which involves sucker-punching random white pedestrians for amusement. And federal
data have long shown that while in most cases the victim and perpetrator of a violent crime are of the same race, black-on-white violent-crime rates far exceed the reverse scenario.
Liberals skirt these plain truths out of a belief that it helps them politically, and perhaps it does. Racial paranoia helps civil-rights activists raise money, and it helps Democrats get elected
by scaring black voters to the polls. But it also comes with a downside for blacks: It undermines trust in American institutions and society.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of Feb. 16, blacks were only 6% of Covid-19 vaccine recipients, even though they are 13% of the U.S. population. ""Across
the 34 states reporting data on vaccinations by race/ethnicity, there is a largely consistent pattern of Black and Hispanic people receiving smaller shares of vaccinations compared to their
shares of cases and deaths and compared to their shares of the total population,"" explains an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Some point to a general and longstanding lack of trust in government among many blacks. Often invoked is the infamous Tuskegee experiment begun in the 1930s, in which black men
were promised but never given treatment for syphilis. But my creeping suspicion is that something more sinister has taken place.
In recent years, and at a much louder volume than before, black Americans have been encouraged by liberal elites to hate their country and to distrust others based on race and ethnicity.
This is the message that undergirds everything from the New York Times's ""1619 Project"" to workplace ""diversity"" training and critical race theory. Now it's working to undermine public
health. Blacks aren't going to fight the virus any differently than other groups. We're in this together, and the newfangled racial separatism that now operates under the guise of wokeness
does no one any good, especially black Americans.

United States: Rally at Thai Consulate in LA on Sunday to call for an end to racial violence,None,Others,2021-02-08,"Both Thai and those of other nationalities, including Americans, plan to gather in front of the Thai Consulate in Los
Angeles this Sunday, local time, to call for an end to what they claim is racial violence, especially against Asian and
Polynesian Americans, and to mourn the death of an 84-year old Thai man who was fatally injured in California.
The elderly Thai man, Mr. Vicha Rattanapakdi, was taking an exercise walk on Anza Vista Road in San Francisco
when a 19-year old attacked him in what was believed to be an act of racial violence against Asians. The victim
was rushed to a hospital but eventually died on January 30th. The assailant was later arrested by San Francisco
police and has now been charged with murder.
The victim's family and the broader Thai community in the US believe, however, that this was a hate crime, fueled
by racial discrimination against Asian Americans. Donations poured in to raise funds for the funeral of the victim.
After the fatal incident, a campaign was launched on social media in Thailand, calling for equal justice, human
rights protection and declaring opposition to racial hatred and discrimination.
According to a report from the Centre to End Racial Violence against Asian-Americans, violence against Asian and
Polynesian Americans across the US has increased by about 40% since the outbreak of COVID-19. - Thai PBS

Californian county creates task force to tackle attacks on Asians,Nirmal Ghosh&8205; US,Others,2021-02-14,"The authorities in Alameda County, California, have created a special response unit focused on crimes against
Asians, particularly older Asians.
The move last Monday came after a string of violent assaults on Asian Americans, including one in Oakland,
California, in which a young man violently pushed a 91-year-old Asian man to the ground.
The video has sent a chill through the Asian American community. Two more Asian Americans, a 60-year-old
man and a 55-year-old woman, were also attacked that same day - Jan 31 - and had to be taken to hospital,
the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
A 28-year-old African American has been arrested. He is a suspect in all three cases.
The incidents came just days after Mr Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thai man, died after he was similarly
attacked while out on a morning walk in his San Francisco neighbourhood on Jan 28.
A 19-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and elder abuse in that case.
At a press conference last Monday in Oakland's Chinatown, Alameda County district attorney Nancy O'Malley,
announcing the task force, said: ""The rapid increase in criminal acts targeted against members of the Asian
community, particularly Chinese Americans, who live and work in Alameda County is intolerable.""
Last week, the Committee of 100, an influential non-partisan group of prominent Chinese Americans in
business, government, academia and the arts, released a White Paper commissioned by the Economist
Intelligence Unit on the contributions of Chinese Americans to the United States.
The release was in response to increased anti-China sentiment in ""an age inflamed with resurgent racism, and
with geopolitical tension reversing decades of fruitful exchange with China"".
""The US has reached a moment when it is critical to examine how diversity has benefited the society and how
minority groups such as Chinese Americans have, over time, become identified with the country itself,"" the
report says.
Chinese Americans contributed more than US$300 billion ($373 billion) to US gross domestic product in 2019
through consumer spending, supporting three million jobs, the report says.
UNACCEPTABLE ACTS
“The rapid increase in criminal acts targeted against members of the Asian community, particularly Chinese
Americans, who live and work in Alameda County is intolerable.”
ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY O'MALLEY, announcing the task force.
""There are over 160,000 Chinese American-owned businesses in the US, generating approximately US$240
billion in revenue and supporting 1.3 million jobs as of 2017,"" it adds.
Last August , the United Nations special rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination,
xenophobia and related intolerance, in a note on the US, wrote: ""Racially motivated violence and other incidents
against Asian Americans have reached an alarming level across the US since the outbreak of Covid-19.""
It added: ""Chinese Americans and other Asian Americans, including those of Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese,
Filipino, and Burmese descent, among others, have been subject to racist, xenophobic attacks.""
It said the attacks included being spat on, blocked from public transport and beaten.
The Jan 6 storming of the US Capitol demonstrated the danger of anti-Chinese sentiment amplified to deafening
levels by right-wing media.
Take, for example, Larry R. Brock, a retired US Air Force lieutenant-colonel photographed carrying zip-tie
handcuffs on the Senate floor during the insurrection by hundreds of Trump supporters.
A week before, he wrote on Facebook that he saw no distinction among the Democrats, the Biden administration
and ""an invading force of Chinese communists"".
On Jan 27, President Joe Biden signed an executive action directing federal agencies to combat xenophobia.
""Today, I'm directing federal agencies to combat the resurgence of xenophobia, particularly against Asian
Americans and Pacific Islanders, that we've seen skyrocket during this pandemic. This is unacceptable and it's
un-American,"" the President said.
The Committee of 100 welcomed the statement, but feels more is needed, hence the White Paper.
Committee of 100 president Zhengyu Huang, who is based in San Francisco, told The Sunday Times: ""Last year,
we saw almost 3,000 documented cases of anti-Chinese and anti-Asian incidents.
""We knew we had to speak up forcefully, because racism and discrimination are unfortunate, negative aspects of
society.
""Despite 175 years of contribution, we still suffer from the perpetual foreigner stereotype, and that
stereotype has been exacerbated by two seismic trends - increasing tension and competition between the US
and China, and Covid-19.""

City takes aim at hate vs. Asians,"Shahrigian, Shant",Others,2021-02-24,"City leaders are boosting efforts to fight hate crimes that have targeted Asian New Yorkers, in particular, since
the start of the coronavirus outbreak.
The recent deployment of extra NYPD officers to the subways will focus in part on preventing hate crimes, while
Mayor de Blasio promised meetings with community leaders this week to hear what else the city can do.
""The NYPD is watching to protect folks and stop these horrible actions,"" Hizzoner said at a Tuesday news
conference, after a series of alarming subway incidents prompted the NYPD to send 500 extra cops to stations
and trains this month.
The recent crime streak includes unprovoked attacks on two Asian senior citizens on subways within a 24-hour
span on Feb. 16.""These racist attacks have been outrageous, unconscionable, disgusting and it must end,"" Rep. Grace Meng (D-
Queens) said at the news conference.Meng and de Blasio partially blamed former President Donald Trump for fomenting hate through racist language
about coronavirus.
""Although Donald Trump is no longer in office, his past anti-Asian rhetoric and use of terms like 'Chinese virus'
[and] 'kung flu' continues to threaten the safety of our community in New York and around the country,"" Meng said.
While police have logged 28 known incidents of ""COVID-related"" hate crimes against Asians and made busts in
18 of those cases since the start of the pandemic, the commanding officer of the NYPD's Asian Hate Crimes Task
Force acknowledged the number of incidents is likely higher.
""These numbers are definitely underreported,"" said the commander, Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo, explaining
that the NYPD categorizes hate crimes as ""COVID-related"" only if the attacker makes statements related to the
virus.
De Blasio and Meng urged New Yorkers to speak out if they see hate crimes.
""So many Asian-Americans literally live in fear and are afraid to leave their homes because they don't know
what might happen to them,"" the congresswoman said.

Lin won't reveal the person who called him 'coronavirus' basketball,"Bondy, Stefan",Others,2021-02-28,"Jeremy Lin said he will not reveal the person who allegedly called him ""coronavirus"" on the court even after his
accusation set off an investigation by the G League.
""I know this will disappoint some of you but I am not naming or shaming anyone,"" Lin wrote on Twitter Saturday
morning. ""What good does it do for someone in this situation to be torn down?""
The former Knicks sensation, 32, who is trying to resurrect his career in the G league bubble with the Golden
State Warriors affiliate, revealed the ""coronavirus"" incident in a Facebook post Thursday that detailed the fight
against prejudice encountered by himself and other Asian Americans.
""Being a 9 year NBA veteran doesn't protect me from being called 'coronavirus' on the court,"" Lin wrote. ""Being
a man of faith doesn't mean I don't fight for justice, for myself and for others.""
The G League was looking into the claim but Lin said he doesn't see the benefit of outing the alleged offender.
""It doesn't make my community safer or solve any of our long-term problems with racism,"" he wrote.
Lin has long been outspoken about being the subject of stereotypes, but over the last year verbal and physical
attacks on Asian Americans have become more prevalent because the pandemic started in China. Donald Trump,
the former President, inflamed the hatred by labeling COVID-19 ""the China virus"" and ""Kung flu"" while blaming the Chinese for the death-ravaging outbreaks in America.
In New York, reported hate crimes involving Asian American victims increased over 900% in 2020 - from 3 to
28.
""We are tired of being told that we don't experience racism, we are tired of being told to keep our heads down
and not make trouble,"" Lin wrote. ""We are tired of Asian American kids growing up and being asked where
they're REALLY from, of having our eyes mocked, of being objectified as exotic or being told we're inherently
unattractive. We are tired of the stereotypes in Hollywood affecting our psyche and limiting who we think we can
be. We are tired of being invisible, of being mistaken for our colleague or told our struggles aren't as real.""
Lin was the first American-born NBA player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent when he played for the Warriors in
2010-11. He then signed in New York and became a household name with the birth of Linsanity.
Lin bounced around the league for much of the decade, including two seasons in Brooklyn, and played in China
last season. In five games with the Santa Cruz Warriors of the G League, Lin is averaging 19.6 points and 7.2
assists in 31.3 minutes.
Warriors head coach Steve Kerr was asked about Lin's allegation before Friday's game against the Hornets.
""I just saw the ... post just now, really powerful,"" Kerr said. ""I applaud Jeremy for his words and echo his
sentiments regarding racism against the Asian American community. It's just so ridiculous.""

Hate Crime Alleged
in Man's Stabbing
A Brooklyn man was charged with attempted murder as a hate crime after allegedly stabbing an Asian-American
man in the back in an unprovoked attack in Manhattan's Chinatown, New York Police Department officials said
Friday.
The suspect, Salman Muflihi, allegedly approached a 36-year-old man from behind on Thursday and stabbed
him, police officials say. The victim, who wasn't identified by police, was listed in stable condition at Bellevue
hospital Friday. Mr. Muflihi may have been suffering from psychological distress at the time of the attack,
according to the officials.
The attack comes during a rise in violence in the city and after a string of unprovoked assaults on Asian-American residents, including incidents that police say were motivated by racial bias.
Mr. Muflihi was initially charged with attempted criminally negligent homicide, the officials said, but
subsequent investigation resulted in a reclassification of his alleged actions as a hate crime.
New York City saw 468 homicides in 2020, up nearly 47% from 2019.

World: Anti-Asian Violence in US Demands Response,None,Others,2021-02-15,"Cities across the United States are seeing numerous unprovoked attacks against Asian-Americans, particularly
older people, according to a new study by a coalition documenting and addressing anti-Asian hate and
discrimination.
On January 28 in San Francisco, 84-year-old Vicha Ratanapakdee was knocked to the ground and killed while
walking in his neighborhood. There have been over 20 attacks in Oakland's Chinatown in the past two weeks
that the local Chamber of Commerce considered to be targeted against Asians. On January 31, an assailant
violently knocked a 91-year-old man to the ground and later attacked an older man and woman. On February 3in New York City, Noel Quintana, 61, was slashed across the face, and on the same day in Oakland, a 71-year-
old grandmother was knocked to the ground while crossing the street and robbed.Such attacks are not new. On Twitter, the hashtag #VincentChin has surfaced, highlighting historical anti-Asian
xenophobia and racism fueled by the US auto industry decline of the 1980s, leading to the murder of Chinese
American Vincent Chin in Detroit by two men who blamed Asians for their losing their jobs. Neither served
prison time.
Former President Donald Trump fueled anti-Asian sentiment during the Covid-19 pandemic by using
discriminatory rhetoric to describe the coronavirus, and may have contributed to the racist and violent attacks
across the United States. Between March and December 2020, the coalition Stop AAPI Hate documented over
2,800 anti-Asian hate incidents nationwide.
Shortly after taking office, President Joe Biden signed a memorandum denouncing the Trump administration's
discriminatory sentiments directed at the Asian-American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community and to better
combat anti-Asian racism. As the new administration and local governments turn their attention towards this
human rights issue, they should look to local efforts to combat anti-Asian violence and reimagine community
safety.
Community and political leaders need to continue speaking up and denouncing these violent acts, and officials
need to ensure those who carry out criminal offenses are held to account.
Various community organizations have raised funds to support victims. Activists have called for increased
investment in community-led programs and for attention to the factors that prevent Asian Americans,
particularly older people, from feeling safe in their communities.
Federal and local agencies need to do more work with communities to combat racism. The richest country in the
world should not leave its most vulnerable communities to fend for themselves, especially during a major crisis.

Forever foreigners,None,Others,2021-02-08,"Migrants of colour have often felt like unwelcome outsiders in New Zealand, no matter how long they have lived
here. Mandy Te reports.
As a group of taiko drummers performed at a festival in Porirua, Debbie Donnelly remembers a stranger turning
to her and saying, ""They're not like us.""
Donnelly was the wrong person to pick out of the crowd. For most of her life, she has thought deeply about the
duality of her identity.
When she was younger, people would tell her she had the best of both worlds when it came to being Japanese
and Pakeha. At the time, she didn't know what that meant.
Sitting in her Kapiti home, there's a glint in her eyes as she thinks about her identity, racism, and her mother,
Setsuko.
Setsuko, from the city of Takehara, near Hiroshima, met Mick, a Pakeha man, in Japan through a Catholic priest.
She moved to Wellington in the 1950s, marrying Mick at St Anne's Catholic Church in Newtown. The couple
briefly lived in Masterton before moving to Wellington.
It was in the capital city that Setsuko thrived as an interpreter, meeting prime ministers and the Queen. She
also became a co-founder of the Japanese Society.
Mick was supportive of Setsuko as she pursued her interests.
When it came to the racism, Donnelly says her mother protected her and her siblings from the details, but she
did share anecdotes.
""She felt she was a punching bag for a lot of people [and] a lot of people's frustrations,"" Donnelly says.
""At the time I could only imagine the culture shock, combined with not knowing the language, not knowing what
people are saying about you, but knowing she wasn't being welcomed.""
She believes the racism her mother experienced was linked to anti-Japanese sentiment after the war.
Donnelly's brother, Leo, recalled a moment years after his mother's death when a woman approached him to
apologise for how his mother was treated in Masterton.
""My mother didn't put any blame on anyone, but she was happy to leave, and that was probably because of the
way in which she was spoken about,"" Leo says.
As children, Donnelly and Leo recall experiencing racist taunts signalling to them that ""you're not us"".
The advice Leo got from his parents, and from his mother in particular, was about being resilient - she used The
Great Wave off Kanagawa painting as an example.
""It was not what people thought it may mean, which was 'you can't beat the force of nature'; it was the fact you
bow to the wave but you don't go under,"" Leo says.
""There are some things you can't control but you stay afloat. You work your way up and you work your way
through those situations.""
Nowadays, he sees similar attitudes to the ones he encountered when he was younger come up in pockets -
such as how Asian people have been treated during the Covid-19 pandemic.
When it comes to racism, he says, it's about making it clear that it's unacceptable, while also providing support
for people on the receiving end, to help them cope with the emotional impact.
""People act out of ignorance and fear, but it still doesn't make it right.""
While Setsuko never shied away from her Japanese roots, she considered New Zealand her home and herself a
Kiwi.
Their mother's experience of feeling like a ""punching bag"" and feeling unwelcome is not something she went
through alone.
Living under another's roof
New and old migrants have gone through those feelings - stemming from the concept of being treated as
""forever a foreigner"". Emeritus Professor Manying Ip has studied the ""forever a foreigner"" concept for decades,
mainly in connection to Chinese New Zealanders.
Speaking to Chinese New Zealanders, she noted how they felt out of place - as if they didn't belong.
Using a Chinese saying to define the concept, she says it is about people from minority groups feeling as though
they are living under another person's roof.
It was someone else's place, not theirs, and they would never feel as though they belonged, she says.
University of Auckland senior sociology lecturer Dr David Tokiharu Mayeda says that, when people think about
migrants and what it means to be a migrant, implicit within that are perceptions about migrants of colour.
""It's diverse Pacific communities, Asian communities, Middle Eastern and African communities but it's not
European communities.
""If you're from a European background, you're from a migrant community. Your ancestors may have been
here for a long time, but you're still migrants.""
But ancestors of Pakeha migrants brought with them a level of power, enabling them to change the systems
in Aotearoa to focus on economy and profit. This meant other migrant groups were working within the
confines of systems created by European settlers.
Mayeda noticed this feeling of foreignness trickle into his students' work - particularly in those with Asian
backgrounds - when it came to one assignment that required them to write about their lives.
The Asian students who were born here, or moved here when they were young wrote about distancing
themselves from their families, ""and they will use this terminology - trying to distance themselves from FOBs
(fresh off the boat)"".
More recent Asian migrants wrote about hating themselves and getting depressed about the racial
stereotypes they had started to believe, he says.
Like Asian communities, Pacific communities are extremely diverse - and both umbrella ethnic communities
can face being treated as ""forever foreigner"", Mayeda says.
In the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, East Asians in particular were cast as ""virus-spreading foreign
threats"", he says. That stereotype then shifted to Aotearoa's Pacific communities in mid-2020.
""In general, however, because Pacific peoples have closer cultural connections to Maori, and geographic
connections to nearby Pacific nations, they tend not to be cast as foreign threats in the same way as Asians.
""Research I've been involved in shows that Pacific peoples are subjected to racism that many Maori
understand - being unfairly suspected as criminogenic, lazy in school and work.
""In contrast, Asians get cast as the distant foreign threats who will take over the economy, housing market
and schools if not kept in check.""
He believes it's important for New Zealand to recognise Maori as tangata whenua, and also that anyone who
is not Maori, including Pakeha, comes from a migrant background.
'All they see us as are sports stars and entertainers'
The University of Auckland's Dr Sereana Naepi says it was ""very telling"" how quickly and easily the rumours
targeting Auckland's Pasifika communities over the August Covid-19 cluster were believed.
One rumour suggested that a woman from a Pasifika family contracted the virus by sneaking into a managed
isolation facility to see a man.
This fed into the ""dusky maiden"" trope stemming from colonial times, which sexualised and objectified Pacific
women.
""People latched on to this fake story of criminals and sex,"" Naepi says.
New Zealand's colonising of the Pacific cemented the colonisers' views of Pacific communities as children to
be taken care of, instead of strong, independent nations capable of caring for themselves.
Colonisers took on an almost paternal role so that Pacific communities were incapable of being seen as a
foreign threat, she adds.
""People are happy to have Pacific communities when they benefit from their labour and cultural capital, but
they're less likely to invest in these communities.
""All they see us as are sports stars and entertainers - in their minds, we have a specific space to fill in New
Zealand society.""
And when this wasn't filled? Pacific communities were labelled as people who did not contribute, as
underachievers and criminals, she says.
Gatekeeping who gets to be kept in and out
Grace Gassin, a researcher and curator of Asian New Zealand histories at Te Papa Tongarewa, says ""for a
lot of New Zealand's history, there's been a desire to keep New Zealand white for lack of a better way to
put it"".
""I guess we're all dealing with the legacies of anti-Chinese discrimination and, broadly, discrimination
against non- whites which happened legislatively, administratively and socially.""
Asian migrants had been around during seminal events and there were also instances of solidarity between
Maori and Asian communities - moments often not heard about when New Zealand history is told.
She mentions Minnie Rose Alloo, a woman of Chinese and Scottish ancestry, as an example of this. Her
signature sits neatly on a suffrage petition in 1893. She was 19 at the time of signing, making her too
young to do so.
Gassin says the way some New Zealand history was written makes it seem as if Pakeha were ""colonial
mediators"".
As the dominant group, they had a central position, which meant they could determine the relationship
between other ethnic groups, she says.
""Pakeha are colonisers here on this land, so it's interesting. You could argue that they're the ultimate
foreigner and migrant in the context of New Zealand history.
""But it's often that dominant group who gets to decide who are the foreigners, and gatekeep who gets to
be kept in and out. They're the ones that get to form a nation's identity.""
After the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, people could enter the country, but those who were not British
were considered aliens.
But throughout history, there have been barriers to prevent people - particularly those of colour - from
coming to New Zealand.
In 1881, immigration restrictions were placed on Chinese people, who had to pay a poll tax to enter.
After World War I, German people, Marxists and socialists were restricted from entering New Zealand.
The 1920 Immigration Restriction Amendment Act, better known as the ""White New Zealand Policy"",
made it difficult for anyone not British to come to New Zealand till the 1970s. Permission had to be
given by the minister of customs.
Chinese migrants were recruited by the Dunedin Chamber of Commerce to work in the Otago goldfields.
The first 12 men arrived from Australia in 1868 and, by late 1869, more than 2000 Chinese men had
come to the goldfields.
Pacific peoples had four waves of migration, dating from 800 to 1000 years ago. The first wave was the
coming of the Maori. The second and third waves were tied to European colonisation of the Pacific, with
people coming to Aotearoa as trainee teachers, missionaries, sailors, whalers and civil servants.
The fourth wave was linked to migration for economic reasons, with Pacific peoples finding work in the
manufacturing and service sectors after World War II.
African Americans arrived in colonial times, but most of the arrivals from Britain's African colonies in the
1870s were white. In the 1960s, black students came to New Zealand through study programmes.
Immigration rules meant very few black people arrived before the 1990s. In 1991, the government
increased the number of refugees, which saw people from Ethiopia, Rwanda, Somalia, Zimbabwe and
other countries move to New Zealand.
In the late 1800s, people from Lebanon migrated to Dunedin, Wellington and Auckland. Other Middle
Eastern groups that moved to New Zealand were Assyrian Christians and refugees from Iraq and Iran
who arrived in the 1990s.
People from Israel, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan and Bahrain
moved to New Zealand in the 2000s.
People of Indian origin have been coming to New Zealand since the late 18th century, often on British
East India Company ships. In the 1890s, Indian migration increased. Pakeha at the time lumped them
with ""Assyrian hawkers"", and there were attempts to create laws against hawker activities and to limit
their immigration.
'There's always a bias'
Waitakere Indian Association president Sunil Kaushal says ""irrespective of whether you're a first or
second generation, there's always a bias"".
""Indians came to New Zealand in the late 18th century and made New Zealand their home, but on the
flip side of it, someone who comes from Europe or America are just seen as Europeans, which is just
'normal Pakeha'.""
People did not ask those of European descent where they came from, he says, which led to an
underlying feeling that Indians were not considered Kiwis.
In 2020, the association commissioned a report to understand the economic significance of people of
Indian ethnicity in New Zealand. It found that 240,000 people of Indian descent contributed $10 billion
to the economy in 2019.
That number is astounding, and shows how much people of Indian origin contribute to New Zealand, but
they are still being put in a box and stigmatised, says Kaushal.
""Is it a myth or is it a reality? I think it's a reality, rather than a myth.
""We are Kiwis. We have given up everything to come here to be in the land of the long white cloud.
This is our home.""
'I feel it in myself'
Veena Patel has Fijian Indian and Pakeha roots. Her family moved from Fiji to New Zealand when she
was 4, after a succession of political coups in the 1980s.
When it comes to her cultural background, she says it can feel difficult to fit in or feel a part of either
of them.
It's not one moment or experience that has made her feel that way, but it's something that strikes
her daily.
""When I say my name, people don't recognise me as having my name,"" she says.""It used to make me
feel like I didn't fit in anywhere and I wanted to minimise or hide my difference to fit in with everyone
else and not be seen to be different in any way.
""As I get older and grow more mature, I've been able to negotiate that for myself. My identity has
been a journey for me, and one of discovery, and I've been lucky enough to have my parents to
explore both sides of myself.""
Patel says identity goes beyond things such as ethnicity, nationality, gender and where you live.
""Your identity and who you see yourself as, especially for culture, that's something you get to define
for yourself. Once you see that and understand that, it's really liberating . . . It doesn't matter
whether people recognise me as Indian any more, because I feel it in myself.""
She feels excited for New Zealand to enter a ""new era of maturity in terms of how we think about our
diversity - how we think about integration as a two-way thing"".
Having a diverse background should be a source of pride, she says. It's not something that has a
bearing on whether people are Kiwi or not, because it is OK to identify with more than one culture.

Olivia raps qnS. 'hate'; Calls for web posse after pal's mom hit in Flushing by man yelling Asian slurs,"Annese, John",Others,2021-02-18,"Actress and anti-hate crime activist Olivia Munn is speaking out after her friend's mom was assaulted outside a
Queens bakery - posting two photos of the alleged attacker on Twitter on Wednesday.
""My friend's mom is a 5'3"" 50+ Chinese woman and she was attacked by this guy in Flushing, NY yesterday on
Main St and Roosevelt between 2-4pm. She left the hospital with 10 stitches in her head,"" the ""X-Men:
Apocalypse"" and ""The Newsroom"" actress wrote.
""We're gonna find this guy. Queens, Internet, please... do your s--.""
Police have not yet confirmed the photos were of the suspect.
Cops said the 52-year-old victim was standing on line outside a bakery Tuesday when a man in a red jacket and
gray pants started arguing with her, then pushed her. The victim hit her head against an object and the man
fled.
Medics took the victim to New York-Presbyterian Hospital Queens. The attacker remained on the loose as police
continued to investigate, including whether the attack would be considered a hate crime.
In a Facebook post Tuesday night, the victim's daughter Maggie Kayla Cheng called the assault a hate crime.
""I am heart broken and devastated. This ... was yelling out racial slurs, walks into my mom and shoved my
mother on Main street and Roosevelt Avenue in Flushing, Queens today,"" she wrote. ""He shoved her with such
force that she hit her head on the concrete and passed out on the floor.""
Munn - whose mother is Chinese and whose father is white - has spoken out against anti-Asian hate crimes. The
former ""Attack of the Show!"" co-host posted a statement on her Instagram account last week railing against the
spike in bias attacks against Asian-Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The racist, verbal and physical assaults have left my community fearful to step outside,"" she wrote, adding: ""To
simply exist as a minority in this country is seen as a protest to some. We need help amplifying the outrage. We
need help to feel safe in our country. We need help to be safe in our country.

CELEBRATING LUNAR NEW YEAR: LIers reflect on what Year of the Ox may bring,"Zou, Dandan; Planas, Antonio",Others,2021-02-12,"The year of 2020 was marked by losses.
Long Islanders celebrating the Lunar New Year's Day on Friday are eager to move on from the tumultuous and
tragic year of the Rat and welcome the new year of the Ox with centuries-long traditions that reaffirm their
roots.
Amid a pandemic that brought a rise in anti-Asian discrimination in New York and elsewhere in the country,
there is also hope for a new year that will heal divisions.
The anguish of the past year goes far beyond the Asian community, said Christine Liu, president of the Herricks
Chinese American Association.
""Last year was a year of a lot of hurt physically, emotionally and socially,"" Liu said. ""I feel this new year is one of
hope and healing - healing in terms of everything that's happened in our nation, from the pandemic to the
division politically and socially. This year, I'm looking forward to a more hopeful and united year.""
As the holiday typically invites reflection, three Long Islanders spoke to Newsday of their family rituals and the
new year's outlook.
Yeonwoo Lee
Lunar New Year for Lee, 16, conjures up memories of devouring Tteokguk, a rice cake soup, and sending videos
to her relatives in South Korea of her donning a hanbok, a dress worn in her native country during special
occasions.
The high school sophomore said she was a toddler when she moved to the United States from Seoul, and the
holiday is a way for her to reconnect with her heritage.
""It ties me back to my culture since I've been living in America my whole life,"" Lee said. ""Celebrating the new
year with my family makes me feel more Korean.""
Lee, of Plainview, recalled another holiday custom of receiving money from loved ones. In her family, children
are gifted between $10 and $200, meant to represent a prosperous future, she said.
""I remember receiving money from relatives, and I remember being happy. We have to receive it with two
hands"" as a ""sign of respect,"" she said.
Because of the pandemic, Lee said this year's festivities will be limited to her home with only her immediate
family.
She said the struggles over the past year and yearning for a better future are emblematic in 2021's celebrations
of the year of the Ox, an animal that is said to symbolize hard work and perseverance.
""The pandemic requires a lot of resilience from everyone,"" the teen said.
The COVID-19 crisis, however difficult, has given her a newfound appreciation of her South Korean bloodlines
and the traditions that come with them, she said.
""I often viewed these kinds of family gatherings as an inconvenience. Sometimes, I would rather stay home,""
Lee said. ""I realized how much I took for granted and how much I enjoyed these gatherings. From now on, I will
value them more.""
Wai-Lin Ng
Ng's fondest holiday memories include gatherings with her family in New York City, where she cooked dumplings
for hours while partaking in upbeat conversations.
""The Chinese dumplings - that was always a must-have,"" said Ng, 57, of Sound Beach. ""It was my parents,
aunts and their friends. Dumplings made by hand, it only takes a few minutes to eat them, so you have to
constantly be making them all day.""
Maintaining pleasantries to abide by the holiday spirit of prosperity was a must, Ng said.
""There was always good conversations and never bad words spoken,"" she said, adding it's ""bad luck"" to spoil the
positive vibes.
The pandemic has prompted Ng to pivot away from face-to-face celebrations like cooking traditional meals with
relatives and attending lion dances, in which performers wear an elaborate, colorful head ornament and move to
the rhythms of drumbeats, in Chinatown in Manhattan.
Instead, Ng plans to attend a virtual celebration and video chat with college classmates who live abroad in
countries like Singapore and Japan.The 2021 Lunar New Year takes on even more significance in the effort to move on from an uptick in hate-
related crimes and reports of discrimination against Asians, Ng said.She had one such negative encounter last winter at a Rocky Point grocery store. It occurred before masks
became a common protective measure. Ng said a woman stared at her and then pulled her scarf over her
nose and mouth.
She hasn't experienced another similar interaction since, but the moment stuck with her, said Ng, who was
born in Hong Kong and emigrated to the United States when she was a child.
""At the time, I felt a little embarrassed,"" said Ng, who has lived on the Island for most of her adult life. ""I
only realized it when I started to think about all the rhetoric that was going on and why people would do
something like that. For a while, it made me a little angry.""
To combat anti-Asian sentiments, Ng said raising awareness of Asian culture is key.
""The more we do to engage other Asians in the community, and the more we share in culture and language,
is the only way we overcome these stereotypes and cultural barriers,"" she said.
Kevin Quan
The Lunar New Year was ""a special day"" for Quan when he was growing up in Jamaica, Queens.
That day started special with no school.
Instead, his parents would drive him and his siblings to Chinatown in Manhattan to visit their grandparents,
relatives and friends. By the end of the day, he would go home with dozens of money-filled red envelopes,
known as hongbao.
""It seemed that whole day, every single adult except your parents would give you something,"" he recalled
with a laugh. ""When you were a little child, you never had your own money. Receiving hongbao was exciting.
It didn't happen at any other time of the year. It didn't even happen during Christmas.""
Quan, 39, doesn't remember what he did with the money. What he does remember is taking the crisp bills
out of the envelopes, putting them in a pile and counting them before putting the money away in a shoebox
under his bed.
""As a child, I didn't have a job. I didn't get an allowance,"" Quan said. ""Back then, I felt like it was the most
money I ever had in the world.""
What else Quan remembers were the packed streets, crowded festivities and loud fireworks going off in
Chinatown at night.
""It felt like a day of fun,"" he said. ""It was special.""
Now a father of two, Quan said his family will downsize a typical 20-person inaugural New Year's meal at his
parents' Bayside house to a small one with his wife, daughters and mother-in-law at their New Hyde Park
home.
For the bigger family that includes his parents, siblings, nephews and nieces, Quan said the family will likely
get together on Zoom.
""It has been a hard year, and I think it's going to be a hard year still,"" Quan said. ""I'm optimistic about it,
and I want to approach it in a positive way. But I think everybody realizes that there's still a lot of hard
work to be

'I feel targeted'; Vic sees anti-Asian hate in attack,"Roman, Carla; Chelsia Rose Marcius",Others,2021-02-27,"Within minutes of being pepper-sprayed in SoHo, Yaeji Kim knew she had been the victim of a random attack -
and possibly a hate crime.
As she made her way home, still crying from the burning in her eyes and temporary blindness, Kim tried to push
the severity of the Feb. 16 incident out of her mind.
Yet the more she thought about the man who rolled down the window of a dark-colored sedan on W. Houston
St. and pointed a canister at her, the more frightened she felt.
""When it first happened, I felt helpless. And as I was walking home ... I was crying because it burned, but
[because] I was also feeling bullied,"" 30-year-old Kim, a pharmacist and professor who grew up in South Korea,
told the Daily News on Thursday.
""I tried to downplay it ... I wasn't even going to report it. But I think I am more traumatized than I thought,""
she said. ""It's hard for me to walk down Houston Street ... and whenever I'm on the subway I'm really tense,
and [have] a panic attack.""
""I feel targeted,"" she continued. ""I wish I didn't feel this [way]. I wish it didn't affect me as much as it has.""
Kim, who reported the attack to police on Feb. 18, said she did not recognize the passenger who pepper-sprayed her or the driver of the sedan, both of whom she claims were white men in their 20s or 30s.
The attack has not yet been ruled a hate crime, though Kim said she has been in close contact with the NYPD
Asian Hate Crimes Task Force. There have been no arrests.
The incident is the latest in a string of random attacks on Asian-Americans across the city.
Police have made 18 arrests in 28 incidents of ""COVID-related"" hate crimes against Asians since the start of the
pandemic, though the commanding officer of the task force acknowledged many more incidents have likely gone
unreported.
City officials have responded by directing the 500 additional officers deployed to the subway system to help
combat bias, and Mayor de Blasio has vowed to meet with community leaders about the issue.
Yet for Kim, an HIV pharmacist at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University and a professor at Touro College
of Pharmacy, the lingering fear of another unexpected ambush has left her on edge.
""As an Asian woman I have experienced racism but not [to] this extent ... I don't think we were expecting this
kind of hate towards us,"" said Kim. ""Now we are worried about going outside and taking the train and doing
normal things.
""If there was logic to this, I think it would be easier to solve,"" she said. ""But I don't think there's logic to this
right now. It's just chaotic.""

harassment for shoving the 52-year-old woman - the mother of Munn's friend - during an argument in a bakery at Main
St. and Roosevelt Ave. in Flushing on Tuesday.
The woman struck her head against a newspaper stand, suffering a deep cut to her head, cops said.
Mateo, 47, was not hit with hate-crime charges. Cops found no evidence that he made any anti-Asian statements
during the attack, officials said. He lives a few blocks from the baker.
The ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" star posted two surveillance images of the attacker on Twitter Wednesday as she made a

"Violence Against Asian-Americans Raises Concern in Bay Area; Police in Oakland, Calif., recently arrested a man suspected in a string of assaults in that city's Chinatown","Lazo, Alejandro",Others,2021-02-12,"SAN FRANCISCO—Political leaders in the San Francisco Bay Area are forming task forces and speaking out against anti-Asian violence after a spate of recent incidents that include
two assaults against elderly men that were captured on video.
In Oakland, Calif., police on Feb. 5 arrested a man suspected in a string of assaults in that city's Chinatown, including allegedly pushing a 91-year-old man to the ground.
Yahya Muslim, 28, was arraigned on Tuesday and is due to return for a plea hearing on March 2 in Alameda County Superior Court. Brendon Woods, the county public defender whose
office is representing the suspect, said Mr. Muslim has a history of mental illness and substance abuse and there is no evidence of bias against Asian-Americans in the case.
The assaults spurred Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley to create a special response unit that she said would include members who speak Cantonese and Mandarin
that will aim to build trust and engagement with crime victims.
""Since the onset of Covid-19 we have seen an uptick in crime against Asian Americans,"" Ms. O'Malley said.
In San Francisco, video of a Jan. 28 attack on Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old man originally from Thailand, has spurred fear among elderly Asian-Americans in the city, local
activists said. Mr. Ratanapakdee was on a morning walk in a residential enclave when he was knocked to the ground by a man who ran into him. Mr. Ratanapakdee died two days later
at a local hospital.
The authorities have charged Antoine Watson, 19, with murder and elder abuse.
Sliman Nawabi, a public defender representing Mr. Watson, said his client didn't intend to kill Mr. Ratanapakdee and likely wasn't aware of the man's race or age. Mr. Watson pleaded
not guilty to the charges.
""I know it's gotten a lot of attention...because there's been other incidents in the Bay Area, and nationally, targeting Asian-Americans,"" Mr. Nawabi said. ""But this case here is not
motivated by Mr. Ratanapakdee's race or his age.""
According to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, attacks on people of Asian descent in the U.S. have been on the rise since
the start of the pandemic last year. In March and April, there were more anti-Asian hate crimes in various cities than the previous totals for the full year of 2019, said Brian Levin, a
professor of criminal justice and director of the center.
New York City had a record year of hate crimes against Asians in 2020, according to preliminary data, while in Los Angeles and San Jose, such crimes more than doubled from 2019,
according to preliminary data analyzed by Dr. Levin. The attacks range from people being spat on to assaults.
The New York Police Department formed this past fall an Asian Hate Crime Task Force , its first-ever task force dedicated to investigating crimes targeting a single race.

Pinoys in US told to exercise caution amid attacks vs. Asians,None,Others,2021-02-26,"Manila, Feb. 26 -- Filipinos in the United States are advised to exercise ""utmost caution"" as the Philippine
Embassy in Washington, D.C. expressed concern over the rise in unprovoked attacks against Asian-Americans in
various parts of the US.
American news organizations have reported a surge in anti-Asian slurs and violence in cities across the US,
particularly among older people.
One of the recently reported attacks involved a Filipino, whose face was disfigured after a man slashed his face
with a box cutter while inside a subway train in New York City.
""Filipinos are advised to exercise utmost caution in view of these incidents. Those who experience attacks are
advised to immediately call 911 to report incidents,"" the embassy said in a statement on Friday.
The embassy, nevertheless, thanked the swift action taken by a number of local authorities to apprehend
perpetrators of the attacks, labeled by many as ""hate crimes"".
However, it called on federal, state, and local authorities to further ensure the protection of persons of Asian
descent, including Filipinos.
A coalition called Stop AAPI Hate said it received a total of 2,808 reported incidents of racism and discrimination targeting Asian-Americans across the US between Mar. 19, 2020 and Dec. 2020.
Chinese nationals made up the ethnic group most often targeted, making up 40.7 percent of incidents,
according to its report released on Feb. 9.
""Asian-Americans as a whole, though, are being racially profiled and attacked. Koreans (15.1 percent);
Vietnamese (8.2 percent) and Filipinos (7.2 percent) have also faced Covid-19 discrimination in high numbers,""
it said.

How the racism virus spreads along with COVID-19,"Jeung, Russell; Kulkarni, Manjusha P; Choi, Cynthia",LA Times,2020-04-01,"Coughing is now a doubly serious concern for Asian Americans. Like everyone else, we're afraid of contracting the coronavirus. As a racial group, we have an additional fear:
being profiled as disease-carriers and being maliciously coughed at.
After news of the coronavirus broke in January, Asian Americans almost immediately experienced racial taunts on school campuses, shunning on public transit and cyberbullying
on social media. When President Trump insisted on labeling the coronavirus the ""Chinese virus"" in early March, these attacks became more virulent and common.
The FBI now warns of an increase of hate crimes against Asian Americans, but we've already experienced a surge.
Since the Stop-AAPI-Hate website, a project of the Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council and Chinese for Affirmative Action, launched on March 19 to track anti-Asian
harassment, it has received more than 1,000 reports from people in 32 states detailing verbal abuse, denial of services, discrimination on the job or physical assaults.
Several people have reported others coughing at them, including this frightening incident: ""A white man on open sidewalk approached and stepped directly in front of me and
coughed in extremely exaggerated manner in my face -- loudly, mouth wide open, about 2 feet from my face, said 'take my virus.'""
In Texas, the FBI is investigating the stabbing of a father and two children from Burma by an assailant who blamed them for the pandemic. This case harks back to the 1982
murder of Chinese American Vincent Chin, whose killers believed he was Japanese and responsible for the decline of the American auto industry.
Sadly, this kind of racist resentment is a recurring pattern in American history, particularly during health crises or in wartime.
When the bubonic plague arrived in 1900, the San Francisco Health Department quarantined that city's Chinatown with barbed wire and ropes. While white citizens were allowed
to leave, 30,000 Chinese were segregated and confined. During World War II, fear and racist hysteria led to the unconstitutional relocation and imprisonment of 120,000
Japanese Americans.
The current vilification of Asian Americans is reminiscent of the scapegoating of Arabs, Muslims and South Asians after 9/11. Hate crimes against Muslim Americans surged in
2001 and remained elevated above pre-9/11 levels years later.
Ethno-religious groups, like Sikhs from India, also suffered attacks and discrimination after 9/11.
Immediately after 9/11, President Bush denounced those who intimidated Muslims and called on the nation to treat this American community with respect. In contrast, Trump
repeatedly used the term the ""Chinese virus"" despite warnings that this would incite racist threats against Asian Americans. His tepid retreat on that rhetoric last week did little
to stem the harm. The damage is done.
Republicans in Congress continue to blame China as the source of the virus, rather than focusing on how to control the spread of COVID-19. Trump's language, along with media
coverage of his remarks, have framed how Americans view Chinese people, and correspondingly, Asian Americans.
Even the face mask has become racialized, with some Asian Americans fearing that wearing one in public would draw attention and make them targets for physical attacks.
American history repeats itself in another way. Asians in the U.S. have always fought the discrimination they faced. Chinese Americans filed lawsuits against the Chinese
Exclusion Act and engaged in mass resistance to unjust government policies. Japanese Americans won reparations for their wartime incarceration. Muslim Americans are gaining
political power and have run for office in record numbers, with two recently elected to Congress.
Last week, Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) introduced a resolution calling on all public officials to condemn anti-Asian bias and on federal law enforcement officials to collect data to
document and investigate hate crimes tied to COVID-19.
State leaders like Gov. Gavin Newsom should form a multi-agency task force to coordinate efforts to combat racial bias spurred by the pandemic. They should notify stores to
provide safe access to their goods and warn employers about workplace discrimination. And schools and colleges need to provide culturally competent mental health services to
Asian American students and other affected communities.
This pandemic requires us to stop the spread of both COVID-19 and racial hatred. Asian Americans need allies who will intervene when they see racial profiling happening.
We need to learn from American history and have the courage and leadership to counteract fear and anxiety in this time of crisis.

When belonging is conditional; A moment always comes along to remind you that race will be used to define you.,"Cho, John",LA Times,2020-04-22,"I called my parents a few nights ago to tell them to be cautious when stepping out of the house, because they might be targets of verbal or even physical abuse. It felt so
strange. Our roles had flipped.
My plea mirrored the admonitions I received from them as a child growing up in Houston. The world, they cautioned, was hostile and it viewed us as strangers. So they warned
me to stick close to my family. Close to my kind.
The fact that the coronavirus seems to have originated in China has spawned a slew of anti-Asian hate crimes. Across the country, Asian American parents and children are
making versions of the call I made. Friends are sharing first-hand accounts of abuse on text chains and circulating articles on Facebook, always ending with the suddenly
ominous ""stay safe.""
Growing up, the assumption was that once we became American enough, there would be no need for such warnings -- that we would be safe. To that end, my parents
encouraged me and my younger brother to watch as much television as possible, so that we might learn to speak and act like the natives. The hope was that race would not
disadvantage us -- the next generation -- if we played our cards right.
When I became an actor (maybe as a result of all that TV), and really started to work, I felt glimmers of my parents' hope coming to fruition -- doors were open, strangers were
kinder. In some ways, I began to lead a life devoid of race. But I've learned that a moment always comes along to remind you that your race defines you above all else.
It might be a small moment, like a salesperson greeting you with ""konnichiwa."" Or it might be a string of moments, like the press tour that Kal Penn and I took to promote
""Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle"" in 2004, a few years after 9/11.
We flew across the country -- New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Seattle -- and it became a grim routine: Flight after flight, Kal would be pulled aside for a ""random"" search. On one
leg of the tour, Kal's friend Gabe joined us, and when we hit security, Kal was selected for a search while Gabe and I flew through unscathed. We gathered our bags and waited
on a bench for Kal to be released. Rummaging through his backpack, Gabe suddenly said, ""Kal's going to be annoyed."" When I looked inside it, I realized why: Gabe, who is
white, had gone camping recently, and had neglected to remove his Rambo-sized hunting knife from his backpack.
I gasped and looked back at Kal, who was watching a Transportation Security Administration worker empty the contents of his bag. It was a reality check.
Asian Americans are experiencing such a moment right now. The pandemic is reminding us that our belonging is conditional. One moment we are Americans, the next we are all
foreigners, who ""brought"" the virus here.
Like fame, the ""model minority"" myth can provide the illusion of ""raceless-ness."" Putting select Asians on a pedestal silences those who question systemic injustice. Our
supposed success is used as proof that the system works -- and if it doesn't work for you, it must be your fault.
Never mind that 12% of us are living below the poverty line. The model minority myth helps maintain a status quo that works against people of all colors.
But perhaps the most insidious effect of this myth is that it silences us. It seduces Asian Americans and recruits us to act on its behalf. It converts our parents, who in turn,
encourage us to accept it. It makes you feel protected, that you're passing as one of the good ones.
And because the stereotypes may be complimentary (hardworking, good at math), it makes people -- including us -- think that anti-Asian sentiment is somehow less serious,
that it's racism lite. That allows us to dismiss the current wave of Asian hate crimes as trivial, isolated and unimportant. Consider the comedians who mock Asians, but restrain
themselves when it comes to other groups.
Of course, with the falsely positive come the negative stereotypes (you're sneaky, you're stealing jobs, you're corrupt). After I had been busted for cheating on a Latin quiz in
high school, I recall my teacher asking, ""Why are Koreans such cheaters?""
During times of national stress, it's these darker stereotypes that prevail. My wife's families were incarcerated in camps during World War II, even while her great-uncles were
serving in an all-Japanese American battalion of the U.S. Army. Vincent Chin, a Chinese American autoworker, was brutally beaten to death in Detroit in 1982, blamed for the
Japanese ""takeover"" of the auto industry. And just recently, an Asian woman in Brooklyn had acid thrown at her while she was taking out the trash, another among the
skyrocketing attacks against Asians.
I came to this country in 1978, at the age of 6. I was naturalized on Nov. 21, 1990, during the military buildup before the start of the Gulf War. I remember being surprised by
the judge at the ceremony asking me whether I would defend my country in uniform if called upon. I wasn't expecting that question, though my friends and I had been
wondering about a possible draft, and I took my time to truly consider it. I answered yes and I meant it.
I claimed the citizenship my parents wanted for me and I think I've spent my life earning it. I'm not going to let anyone tell me or anyone who looks like me that we are not
really American.
If the coronavirus has taught us anything, it's that the solution to a widespread problem cannot be patchwork. Never has our interconnectedness and our reliance on each other
been plainer.
You can't stand up for some and not for others. And like the virus, unchecked aggression has the potential to spread wildly. Please don't minimize the hate or assume it's
somewhere far away. It's happening close to you. If you see it on the street, say something. If you hear it at work, say something. If you sense it in your family, say something.
Stand up for your fellow Americans.",5894
Asian seniors fighting back; Violent attacks against older communities lead some to pursue self-defense options. ,"Kuo, Chris",LA Times,2021-09-25,"In June, a 70-year-old Filipino American man was punched in the face at Don Knabe Community Regional Park in Cerritos. 
The assailant told the man to ""go back to your country."" 
A month later, dozens of Asian American senior citizens practiced self-defense moves in the same park where the attack occurred. 
Wearing sun visors and fanny packs, the seniors kicked, punched and jabbed. 
Sovanna Yeang, 65, was practicing groin kicks, slamming her leg into a foam pad that a volunteer held in front of his crotch. 
Yeang, who is Chinese Cambodian, said she is concerned for her safety after seeing television news reports about attacks against elderly Asians. 
""If somebody attacked me, I didn't know what to do,"" she said. ""I'd just run. I didn't know how to yell or anything. Now, I learned some things. I'm not scared anymore."" 
The self-defense class was organized by Seniors Fight Back, which formed early this year as hate crimes against Asians rose during the pandemic. 
Violent attacks, captured on video, against older Asians in Oakland and San Francisco Chinatowns have left some senior citizens so fearful that they barely leave the house. So far, Seniors Fight Back has hosted five classes providing seniors with basic grounding in how to defend themselves against an attacker. 
""There were so many attacks on our elders, and I was just getting really frustrated,"" said Tony Dang, 32, a co-founder who owns a Vietnamese pancake catering company in Fountain Valley. 
While some Asian Americans have organized volunteer patrols to escort seniors to their destinations, the answer for Dang lay in self-defense. 
A friend, Andy Luong, had shared an Instagram post about boxing classes that raise funds for Asian American and Pacific Islander organizations. 
Dang asked Luong to connect him with Box for Change, the group that runs the classes. Dang spoke with Hong Lee, the 35-year-old victim of a racist verbal attack at a Los Angeles restaurant, who had been taking the boxing classes. 
The three began discussions that expanded to include a network of friends and acquaintances, including mixed martial arts fighter Ron Scolesdang. 
Their first class, in Hawthorne on May 12, drew about 20 seniors. A few weeks later, in Little Saigon, more than 200 showed up. 
The group of about 10 volunteers is seeking nonprofit status and is hoping to expand to more cities in Southern California and across the country. 
In California, anti-Asian hate crimes more than doubled last year, according to the state attorney general. 
Then-President Trump has emphasized the coronavirus' Chinese origins, and some people have attacked Asian Americans with rhetoric asserting that they are to blame for the pandemic. 
Elderly Asian immigrants who are assaulted are often reluctant to speak out, said Linda Vo, a professor of Asian American studies at UC Irvine. 
Many are wary of the police, uncomfortable about communicating in English or ashamed about being victims, she said. But the rise in anti-Asian attacks has mobilized many Asian Americans and encouraged them to share their experiences, according to Judy Wu, a professor of Asian American studies at UC Irvine. 
""It's been such an intensity of racialized attacks that more and more people are understanding that there's a need to speak up,"" Wu said. 
Self-defense classes for senior citizens have also caught on in Little Tokyo. 
Janette Lee, a second-degree black belt in tae kwon do who served as senior activities coordinator for the Little Tokyo Service Center, organized five self-defense classes this year. 
Most of the participants were low-income, monolingual Korean, Japanese or Chinese American senior citizens, Lee said. Almost all were female, and some told stories of being attacked. 
""I started because I was really angry about what was happening, because when I was looking at the news, I saw that most of the hate crimes were targeted toward seniors,"" Lee said. 
Art Ishii, who has taught martial arts in Little Tokyo for three decades, hosted two self-defense workshops in June. 
About 30 people, mostly elderly Asian American women, attended each class. He is considering holding a third. 
""It's sad there is suddenly a need for more self-defense,"" Ishii said. ""It's sad that we can't just do martial arts or go about our business and exercise and walk and take life for granted."" 
At the July Seniors Fight Back class in Cerritos, Shirley Green said she wants the self-defense workshop to become a regular offering. 
""This is excellent,"" said Green, 72, who is third-generation Japanese American. ""They should have it all the time."" 
A husband and wife from Rossmoor said they no longer take walks in their neighborhood after seeing attacks against Asian American seniors on the news. 
""It's always in the back of our minds,"" said the man, 77, who gave only his last name, Jen, because of fears for his safety. ""We've lived in the U.S. for over 30 years. This is the first time we've felt uncomfortable living here."" 
As the event wrapped up and the seniors delivered their final kicks, Cerritos Mayor Pro Tem Chuong Vo said, ""You're all trained fighters now."" Everyone burst into laughter. 
Cesar Echano, the Filipino American man assaulted at the park earlier this year, has fully healed from his injuries. 
He hasn't gone back to the park yet but said he will soon. He said his attacker has not been arrested. 
At another Seniors Fight Back class Aug. 5 in downtown Los Angeles, Scolesdang, the MMA fighter, barked out instructions that were translated into Korean. 
More than 100 people, mostly elderly Korean women, listened as he described how to grab an assailant's neck and perform elbow strikes. 
But these physical techniques should be a last resort, Scolesdang said at the class, which was sponsored by L.A. County Supervisor Hilda Solis. Being aware of surroundings and projecting confidence through body language are the best tools to deter attackers, he said. 
Young Sook Kim, 70, said she has started taking a taxi instead of her usual bus to Koreatown for groceries because she is scared of being assaulted. 
""I want to learn how to protect myself. That's why I'm here,"" she said through a Korean interpreter. ",6196
"'You started the corona!' Anti-Asian incidents rise; As hate episodes exceed 800, activists push Newsom for help","Do, Anh",LA Times,2020-07-06,"Wearing their masks, Donalene Ferrer and two other generations of family members were walking along an Oceanside neighborhood in April when a car pulled up and a woman
yelled: ""You started the corona!""
The accuser, with a baby and a toddler in tow, turned out to be her mother's neighbor, Ferrer said. Still in shock, the victim said she stepped near the woman to ask, ""Why are
you targeting us? I'm a nurse and my father fought for this country. You shouldn't be teaching your children racism.""
Ferrer, 41, a Filipina, remembered the unmasked woman taunting them back: ""Come over here. Say it to my face."" But worried that the person might be carrying a hidden
weapon, Ferrer said, she left.
Hate incidents directed at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are exploding this year, according to advocates pushing for California Gov. Gavin Newsom to boost funding for
programs fighting bias and add a cultural representative to his new COVID-19 task force.
Supporters and organizers of Stop AAPI Hate have documented 832 incidents across the Golden State in the last three months, with assaults and verbal tirades ""becoming the
norm"" since the pandemic started, instigated by people following the inflammatory rhetoric of the nation's highest-profile leader, they say.
""We seem to have a president that has given the green light to the racists to come out of the woodwork and start attacking Asians,"" said state Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi (DRolling Hills Estates), who represents Torrance, the scene of some the most widely viewed hate episodes recorded on video. These include a stranger, later identified as Lena
Hernandez of Long Beach, accosting an Asian woman who was exercising at Wilson Park, telling her to ""go back to whatever ... Asian country you belong in.""
On June 10, the same day at the same location, Hernandez also allegedly berated an Asian man who had parked close to her Honda, calling him ""Chinaman"" and adding: ""You
know what, you need to go home.""
Officials in Torrance -- whose population of over 145,000 is more than one-third Asian -- arrested Hernandez on Friday, charging her with battery stemming from a separate
confrontation with a female bystander at Del Amo Fashion Center last October. Authorities have been flooded with calls about the harassment in June, along with another in
which a racist letter posted on the front door of a cookware shop warned the owner: ""Go back to Japan.... We are going to bomb your store if you don't listen and we know
where you live.""
Muratsuchi joined state Assemblyman David Chiu (D-San Francisco), chair of the Asian Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus, and founders of Stop AAPI Hate, the most prominent
aggregator of incidents, at a news conference last week to denounce structural racism.
Advocates had asked Newsom for $1.4 million to fund research on how the coronavirus is affecting AAPI health in connection to racism and to establish a racial bias strike team
to investigate the mounting problem of COVID-19-related hate incidents against Asian Americans. But the state budget, voted on last month, excluded money for initiatives
supported by the Asian American community.
""Asian Americans need to see concrete actions, and we're here to work with the state to ensure that we can live free from racial discrimination and enjoy equal rights and
access,"" said Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and a founder of Stop AAPI Hate.
Early in the global health crisis, when residents were learning about the coronavirus, business activity in the San Francisco Chinatown area that Chiu represents started dropping
by half, he said.
He also highlighted the case of an older man beaten while collecting cans in the city's Bayview district. An attacker swung a metal bar at the victim while others, shouting racial
slurs, continued to mock him.
""It's incredibly disturbing. There's not just a pandemic of health -- there's a pandemic of hate,"" Chiu said. He points a finger at President Trump's casual use of terms such as
""kung flu"" and ""China virus"" at rallies and press briefings, behavior mirrored by citizens imitating him in everyday speech and inciting hate.
Participants at the news conference cited a new report of multiple examples across 34 counties, including an Asian American family in Los Angeles who said they were harassed
inside the elevator at their apartment building. A couple not wearing face coverings told them ""this f-- virus came from your mother-- country"" and ""you nasty as roaches.""
Another Asian American in Los Angeles reported that ""our Zoom feed was hacked by white supremacists who verbally attacked our members and viewers with racial slurs and
anti-immigrant remarks. They also hacked into our Zoom chat, typing the Nazi salute and pro-Trump messages.""
Counted in the 800-plus incidents taking place at retail stores, work, school and online are 81 incidents of assault and 64 potential civil rights violations, according to Stop AAPI
Hate.
In Rosemead, an Asian American said that ""three Hispanic and two white individuals entered the store and cut in front of me. I spoke up and said, 'Hey, I've been in line and I'm
next.' "" The strangers turned and yelled out names, he said, spitting at the individual and telling him to keep waiting. A cashier said they should stop and asked if the shopper
wanted to alert police. ""I declined and left the store immediately, not wanting any more confrontation,"" he said.
In San Francisco, an Asian American reported that someone threw a glass bottle at her friend while she was putting her baby in the car and yelled a racist epithet. In Santa
Clara, an Asian American reported that a man kicked his dog and ordered him to shut the canine up. Then the man spat on him, adding: ""Take your disease that's ruining our
country. Go home.""
The scapegoating of China and people of Chinese descent happens again and again, said Cynthia Choi, co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, a group that cofounded Stop AAPI Hate. ""Racist demagoguery matched with anti-immigrant policies have always been used to deny Asian Americans full social and political rights,"" she added.
Said Russell Jeung, chair and professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University: ""Without government accountability, we risk COVID-related racism against
Asian Americans becoming deeply entrenched, ultimately impacting the lives of millions of people in California and around the country.""
Ferrer, a birth unit nurse who lives in Riverside County and whose mother is from Oceanside, said her parents find it difficult to be near their confrontational neighbors. She
reported the attack on her family to Stop AAPI Hate when a friend introduced her to the group, after reading her racism posts on Instagram and Facebook. ""We were lucky to
have someone listen to us, but what about all the others who stay silent?"" she asked.
Her daughter, Charlie Ferrer, 17, said that before family members stepped outside that day, she and her mother had just watched a news segment on Asian teenagers being
blamed for the coronavirus and attacked in Australia.
""I felt anger boiling inside of me,"" she recalled. ""It was so surreal. Now I'm telling my friends to be careful because this could easily happen again in the future.""

"Outlooks on race turn gloomier; A majority of Californians say relations between groups are fair or poor, poll finds.","Parvini, Sarah",LA Times,2020-07-14,"Californians' perceptions of race relations in the state have shifted dramatically since the spring, with views statewide having grown significantly gloomier than they were five months ago, according to a new statewide poll.
The survey, which compares its results with a similar poll conducted in February, offers a before-and-after look at how Californians' attitudes have shifted in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, George Floyd's death and the nationwide demonstrations that ensued.
Some 54% of respondents said that relations between people of different races and ethnicities in California were just fair or poor, an uptick of 13 points since February. The number of California adults who believe those relations were excellent or good dropped from 57% to 44%, the poll found. The shift, the poll indicated, occurred across racial and ethnic groups in relatively equal numbers.
White Californians are now much more likely than they were earlier this year to say that Blacks, Latinos and Asians are ""frequently"" discriminated against. The uptick comes as data have shown that the virus disproportionately affects Black and Latino communities, and has led to an explosion in anti-Asian hate incidents, said Paul Ong, director of UCLA's Center for Neighborhood Knowledge, who was not involved in the poll.
""The impacts are unevenly distributed -- whether we're talking about health, whether we're talking employment or stability or negative racial encounters,"" Ong said. ""Under COVID-19, those things have become much more visible and a lot deeper.""
The poll also found that respondents do not attribute the rising tensions to the recent protests over race and social justice.
On the contrary, most Californians, 55%, believe that protests over the deaths of Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and others have brought people in the state together, rather than splitting them further apart. A plurality of respondents described the protests as ""justified"" and ""impactful,"" at 31%, but also as ""violent"" and ""dangerous"" -- 30% and 28%, respectively.
""The categories aren't and don't have to be mutually exclusive,"" said Drew Lieberman, senior vice president at Strategies 360, the polling and research firm that conducted the survey. According to the survey, 67% of Black respondents say that they face frequent discrimination in California. And although the poll shows that whites have become more likely to acknowledge discrimination against people of color, it registered a small countertrend in the increased portion of whites who asserted that white people
face discrimination, and the number of whites who said that their racial identity is ""extremely important"" to them. Both those numbers have gone up, especially among Republicans and supporters of President Trump.
Respondents took part online in the California Community Poll from June 26 through July 6. The survey was commissioned by the Center for Asian Americans United for Self Empowerment, Hispanas Organized for Political Equality and the Los Angeles Urban League in consultation with The Times. Strategies 360 polled 1,184 adult citizens. The margin of sampling error is 3 percentage points.
In addition to taking the pulse on race in the aftermath of nationwide protests, the poll also exposed the manner in which the COVID-19 pandemic ""colors everything else that's going on right now,"" Lieberman said.
The poll also found that a majority of Californians believe police treat Black people unfairly and perceive systemic racism in law enforcement -- a question that was not part of the February survey. Respondents were more divided on how police treat Latinos (46% believe Latinos are treated fairly, while 48% believe they are treated unfairly) and believe that police treat Asians and whites mostly fairly.
And while nearly all of those surveyed support police reform, Californians are divided on which reforms they support. Some 6% would abolish police departments and shift their funding and responsibilities to other agencies, while 12% would leave departments as they are and ensure they have the equipment and funding they need to do their jobs properly.
An additional 45% support more accountability and training, and 32% would go further to shift significant parts of police funding and responsibilities to other agencies while maintaining their role in handling violent crime.
""We're facing a lot of these conversations, not because they're new, but because of environment,"" said Helen Torres, executive director of Hispanas Organized for Political Equality. ""There's huge racial inequalities in our communities and our society, and that creates frustration across the board.""
The data show substantial racial gaps on police reform, with Black respondents most likely to favor shifting funding and responsibilities away from police and whites least likely to endorse such major reforms.
Just over 45% of Black respondents say they would shift funds away from police, while 34% of Latinos and 28% of whites feel that way.
Police reform ""is at the heart of a lot of the discussions that are going on,"" said Michael Lawson, president of the Los Angeles Urban League.
""It is at the core of what Black Lives Matter is demanding, and is an essential part of moving forward,"" Lawson said. ""There have been discussions going back to the Rodney King situation. This is a continuation of that.""
The recent spate of police killings of unarmed Black Americans and subsequent protests has also led to a change in perceptions on discrimination, he added.
""The visibility of people standing in the streets and saying, 'Enough is enough,' is a big change,"" he said. ""There is something different. The needle has moved.""
Compared with February, white respondents are 18 percentage points more likely to believe Black Americans are discriminated against frequently (from 22% saying as much in February to 40%), 10 points more likely to believe Latinos are discriminated against frequently (from 22% to 32%), and 13 points more likely to believe Asians are discriminated against frequently (from 7% to 20%).
There is a ""continuing hierarchy"" in which respondents perceive Black Americans to be the most affected by discrimination, followed by Latinos and Asian Americans, Ong noted.
Charlie Woo, the board chair of the Center for Asian Americans United for Self Empowerment, said it was important for Californians to understand that Asian Americans are also discriminated against.
""People need to be aware of the challenges we face,"" Woo said. ""The fact that Californians [now] recognize Asian Americans don't just fit in as model minorities, but also are discriminated against and face challenges ... that's big progress.""",6696
A window into a deep well of hate; Ignore it? Fight back? Asian Americans navigate racist harassment.,"Mejia, Brittny",LA Times,2021-03-25,"As Syl Tang boarded an elevator in New York City this month, a woman pulled up the corner of her eye in a familiar gesture mocking Asians.
The woman then launched into a coronavirus tirade -- she had stayed at home for a year and done everything right, yet ""a foreigner"" gave her the virus.
Tang's anger rose as she found herself at that well-trodden crossroad faced by anyone targeted because of race, gender, sexual orientation or religion: Stay quiet, or say or do something and possibly risk an escalation?
For many Asian Americans, from immigrants to fifth generation, incidents like the one Tang endured have been an all too normal part of their lives -- usually not rising to physical attacks but feeling at times like a window into a deeper well of hate.
Now a recent spate of attacks against Asians, punctuated by the shooting in the Atlanta area last week that killed eight people, including six Asian women, have put a spotlight on more mundane incidents of bigotry.
The verbal harassment happens in elevators, restaurant bathrooms, taxis and public sidewalks, thrusting victims into a situation for which there is no playbook.
Do you make a joke of it, laugh it off and try to make the moment end? Silently walk away? Explain why the words were hurtful? Tell the person off?
What if, as in videos captured across the country, the encounter turns violent?
Inside the elevator, others chimed in and said that COVID had been ""brought here."" Tang decided to say something.
""I would like you to know that I'm vaccinated,"" said Tang, who wanted the woman to hear that she spoke English fluently and without an accent.
""I wasn't going to get into a fight in an elevator with this woman, but it was very clear to me that in her eyes, I was a foreigner,"" Tang, 48, who is Chinese American, said later.
Tang, the author of a world affairs book, has endured racist incidents on a weekly basis, even before the pandemic.
Once, a group of tourists pulled her out of a cab while telling her to ""go back to squatting on the ground in my pajamas in China."" Another time, a woman shoved her off a subway train onto the platform and called her a derogatory term for Chinese people. Countless times as she walks down the street, men have shouted, ""Me love you long time,"" ""Ching chong ni hao"" or ""Konichiwa"" and then, when ignored, followed up with expletives.
A month ago, a woman spit on her in a restaurant bathroom, saying she didn't ""want to get the coronavirus.""
""I think you take it incident by incident. You try to assess whether it's worth it to fight back, whether it's worth it to say something,"" Tang said. ""I have yelled back at racist slurs on the street. When people say things to me, especially if they assume I don't speak English, I have some choice words for them.""
But to respond every time would feel akin to living in a constant state of combat.
""If you've been going through this for decades, you go through periods where you're really angry, periods where you're resigned, then you're really angry again, then you're resigned,"" Tang said. ""You sort of go back and forth. ... Mentally, you may always want to fight back and you may always want to speak up, but you get tired.""
Before Los Angeles musician John Bach goes on tour with a new band and crew, he sits them down to ""have the talk"" about racist comments and physical attacks he will probably get -- especially when it's a tour through the Deep South or the Midwest.
The 36-year-old, who has been a professional drummer for 17 years and is of Korean descent, has been told, ""I've never seen an Oriental play drums before"" and ""Didn't know a Chinaman can do much else besides math. Let me buy you a beer.""
He ignores the racial stereotypes embedded in the comments and maintains a friendly demeanor.
""I usually deflect and ignore statements. I don't respond in anger, ever, unless I have to defend myself, which is pretty rare, although it does happen,"" said Bach, who was born in South Korea and moved to California when he was 6. ""I approach the situation as I would with any other fan. Just keep the mood light, take whatever it is that they say as a compliment.""
Some people, including former President Trump, have blamed Asian Americans for the coronavirus because it was first identified in China.
Last March, Manjusha Kulkarni was in a hair salon when she overheard two white women saying that Asians spread disease because of the food they eat, citing bats. She weighed whether to say something.
""There's a social etiquette of not challenging things,"" said Kulkarni, the executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and the co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate. ""We're socialized not to say things to people. It's rude. It's potentially disrespectful.""
So Kulkarni said, shaking as she did: ""I apologize for interrupting your conversation. I have to tell you what you're saying is inaccurate.""
""I thought that was the mildest thing I could say and still, their answer to me was, 'You misunderstood what we were saying,' "" Kulkarni recalled.
Along with the trauma suffered in the moment, there are the lingering questions: Could I have said something differently? What if I had said this instead?
""I would feel worse not doing something than doing something, but that's in environments that were still safe,"" Kulkarni said. ""If you asked me, 'Would I do it alone around a big man?' No, I would not.""
When Jackie Louie was a student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, a few men in a truck drove by and shouted racial slurs at her and her friends, who were also Asian American.
""We didn't say anything back,"" she recalled. ""We were silent. We were shocked.""
After some students made fun of her parents for speaking Chinese, her father said he had ignored them because it was better not to cause trouble.
Now she has rehearsed comebacks in her head after hearing about recent racist attacks against Asian Americans.
""I feel like the right thing to do is speak up and defend either myself or whoever is being victimized,"" the 30-year-old Torrance resident said.
""However, I really don't know how it would be until I'm in the moment.""
Joy Kim, who grew up in Orange County, was recently in a New York park when a man asked her age. She has often been told by strangers that she looks young, usually followed by, ""It must be your Asian genes.""
The man seemed friendly at first, so she responded that she was in her 20s. The man told her she looked like she was 2.
""You can never tell with you Chinese people,"" he said.
""I'm actually not Chinese,"" said Kim, who is Korean, reflexively correcting him.
""You're lying. You're Chinese. You have COVID,"" he told her. ""Don't ever take your mask off because you'll give us all COVID.""
As Kim walked away, the man screamed after her, calling her a ""b--"" and threatening to cut off all her hair.
""I almost want to just hide and not say anything or just like not be part of the situation anymore,"" said Kim, who ignores and avoids eye contact with strangers on the street who have greeted her with ""Ni hao"" -- ""How are you?"" in Mandarin. ""I guess I sort of was taught that reacting with anger or anything will make the situation worse.""
What weighed on the 25-year-old the rest of the day was not just the interaction with the stranger but the remarks from friends and acquaintances over the years that she had previously convinced herself were harmless.
""If someone said something racist against Asians in the past, I think I would just laugh it off, I guess, move on, and just like hold your anger for later,"" she said. ""Now I feel like things have changed.""

"Shootings stir fear amid rise in hate crimes; As Asian Americans face more harassment and violence, Atlanta attacks add to anxiety.","Kaleem, Jaweed; Read, Richard",LA Times,2021-03-18,"June Macon planned to celebrate this week when her mother and grandmother had gotten COVID-19 vaccine shots, including finally hugging them after months of separation during the pandemic.
But after a gunman in the Atlanta area left eight people dead -- six of them women of Asian descent -- Macon, a Korean American, said she had ""gone from really, really high to really, really low.""
Macon, a doctoral candidate at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said Wednesday she had watched news reports of the violence with a heavy heart.
""There is so much hatred and violence already against Asian women,"" Macon said during a phone interview. ""We don't need any more.""
Police on Wednesday charged Robert Aaron Long, 21, with eight counts of murder and homicide and one of aggravated assault in the Tuesday killings at three spas in and around Atlanta. Police said the early stages of their investigation indicated Long ""did not appear to be"" motivated by race and was possibly seeking revenge on women at spas he frequented out of frustrations with what an official called his ""sexual addiction.""
But for many Asian Americans, the killings further fueled fears about anti-Asian hatred that has mounted over the last year as police and advocacy groups have reported record numbers of hate crimes and incidents of harassment. Activists have pointed to former President Trump as being responsible for some of the hostility toward Asian Americans, citing his use of terms such as ""China virus,"" ""Wuhan virus"" and ""kung flu"" in referring to the coronavirus -- which was first detected in Wuhan, China.
""I'm checking in with my friends, with my family. We're all wondering what will happen next,"" said Macon, 35. ""Who will the next person be?""
Asian American civil rights groups have raised concerns about violence in recent weeks amid new data showing a historic rise in anti-Asian hate crimes across parts of the nation with the largest Asian American communities.
In a survey of police departments in 16 major cities, the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino tallied 122 anti-Asian hate crimes last year. The number was a 149% increase from the 49 in 2019. New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Seattle and San Jose saw their highest numbers of anti-Asian hate crimes in at least five years. The overall increase in the 16 cities surveyed came as the total number of hate crimes against all minority groups in those cities declined from 1,845 to 1,717.
In Seattle, anti-Asian hate crimes increased by 33% in 2020, a jump from nine to 12 cases. Hateful incidents have continued this year, including messages -- ""China you will pay"" and ""go home"" -- written in hay this week in parking lots of two Seattle churches whose congregants include Asian Americans.
Kendall Kosai, an Anti-Defamation League associate regional director in Seattle, said that regardless of the intent of the suspect in the Atlanta attacks, ""it sends a chilling message to the Asian and Pacific Islander community.""
Kosai, a fourth-generation Japanese American whose grandparents were sent from Kent, Wash., to an incarceration camp in Wyoming during World War II, said he feared that ""Asian Americans will start feeling ashamed of who they are and stop embracing their cultural heritage.""
This week, Stop AAPI Hate, a tracker launched a year ago by Asian American advocacy groups, released data on 3,800 incidents of harassment and violence against Asian Americans that took place over the last year. The majority of the reports, 68%, targeted women and involved harassment. People of Chinese and Korean descent were the most frequent victims, with many perpetrators verbally blaming Asian Americans for the pandemic.
The organization said in statements Wednesday that it believed racism could be a factor in the Atlanta incidents. Police have so far emphasized other possible reasons for the killings.
""As the facts of the Atlanta tragedy continue to emerge, it's important that we do NOT rule out racism,"" Stop AAPI Hate tweeted Wednesday. ""Law enforcement is leading with a narrative that yesterday's violent incident was not racially motivated based on the shooter's testimony. The fact remains that all but two of the victims in this tragic incident were Asian American women and that these were all Asian-owned businesses.""
It's a line of reasoning that resonated with Mimi Chung, a Korean American art director in New York.
""For whatever reason, this man blamed Asian people, Asian women specifically, and decided their lives were worth ending,"" Chung, 46, said in a phone interview. ""I don't think you have to try hard to see that this is racism.""
Chung said the deaths reminded her of her own brushes with racism and harmful sexual stereotypes about Asian women.
""Racism for Asian women doesn't just come in harassment or run-of-the-mill violence. It also comes as this hypersexualization of us,"" she said. ""I've experienced both. Early in the pandemic, I went to the hospital for an arm injury and was told by a random man to 'Go back to COVID f--ing China.' But I've also been told before to take an egg roll and stick it up my you-know-what.""
In Renton, Wash., Terry Yaplee said in a phone interview that he still wasn't sure how much racism may have played a role in the slayings in Georgia.
An Army veteran who received the Bronze Star for service in Vietnam, he's seen racism many times over his 70 years, including this year. As a bus driver in recent years, he was often cut off and told to ""go back"" to where he came from.
His latest encounter was Tuesday, when he arrived at a barber shop, signed the customer list and tried to walk out the door to wait outside. A white man, he said, stood in the doorway and blocked his path before saying, ""Get the f-- out of here!"" Yaplee, a Chinese American, was certain it was because of his race.
""I know you weren't talking to me,"" Yaplee told the man, who ignored him and walked inside. When Yaplee returned for his cut, the man continued to stare at him from outside until the barber told him to stop.
""I thought we were moving forward and away from all that,"" Yaplee said of racism in America.
After the Atlanta shootings, Yaplee wrote on Facebook that it looked to be ""open season"" on Asian Americans in Atlanta. It was a comment that he reflected on more later.
""I misspoke because it infuriated me,"" he said. ""As you read into it and hear the news reports, they're saying maybe it wasn't racially motivated.""

CITY & STATE; Asian woman who was attacked will make big donation,"Pinho, Faith E",LA Times,2021-03-26,"An Asian American woman who was attacked in downtown San Francisco last week will donate nearly $1 million to combat racism against Asians, according to her grandson.
The 75-year-old woman, Xiao Zhen Xie, is recovering after the brutal attack last week, which left her with two swollen and bleeding black eyes. The money comes from an online fundraiser her grandson, John Chen, organized to pay her medical bills.
San Francisco police said 39-year-old Steven Jenkins struck Xie, unprovoked, at 7th and Market streets on March 17.
KPIX-TV Channel 5 reported that Xie defended herself by punching her attacker. Videos showed the woman on a street corner with a bruised face as the attacker lay on a stretcher.
The attack came the day after a gunman killed eight people, including six Asian women, at Atlanta-area spas. Though it is unclear whether the Atlanta massacre was racially motivated, many Asian Americans saw it as the culmination of a string of attacks against Asians during the COVID-19 pandemic.
With former President Trump and others using racial language like ""kung flu"" and ""China virus"" to highlight the virus' origins in China, many Asian Americans have been verbally or physically assaulted. The attack on Xie is one of several violent assaults on Asian American senior citizens in San Francisco and Oakland that have prompted volunteers to start security patrols.
Chen wrote on a GoFundMe page that his grandmother, who has lived in San Francisco for 26 years and is a cancer survivor, had a bruised wrist in addition to serious emotional distress.
Her story and reported defense of herself spread rapidly on social media. Donations poured in -- more than $965,000 in a week.
In an update posted Monday, Chen noted that his grandmother had improved -- the swelling around her left eye had decreased, and she was in better spirits. He also said she was adamant about donating all the funds ""to the Asian American community to combat racism.""
""She said we must not [submit] to racism and we must fight to the death if necessary,"" Chen wrote. ""She insists on making this decision saying this issue is bigger than Her.""
Jenkins had assaulted an 83-year-old Asian man earlier March 17 at the U.N. Plaza, said San Francisco Police Department spokesman Robert Rueca.
A security guard saw the attack and began to chase Jenkins, Rueca said.
While running away, Jenkins struck Xie at 7th and Market streets.
Jenkins was arrested and hospitalized for injuries unrelated to the attacks, Rueca said.
The advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate has tracked more than 3,700 self-reported verbal and physical attacks against Asian Americans across the U.S. since the pandemic began.
San Francisco police conducted 17 hate crime investigations of all types in 2020, up from six a year before, according to SFPD data.
""Just the thought of leaving your house and being killed or seriously injured for being Asian is an extremely disturbing thought,"" Chen wrote. ""All the hatred that is happening towards the AAPI community has deeply angered and saddened our family. The AAPI community is bleeding from this violence and hatred. We as a community cannot stay silent nor be silenced anymore.""

"SPORTS; Roberts condemns hatred toward Asians; Dodgers manager, whose mother is Japanese, addresses racial violence.","DiGiovanna, Mike",LA Times,2021-03-09,"A rise in hate crimes toward Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted Dodgers manager Dave Roberts to send an email to the entire organization decrying the wave of bullying and violence as ""cowardice.""
Roberts, the son of a Japanese mother and Black father, said the email, the contents of which were first reported by the Athletic on Monday, was prompted not by a specific event but by ""something that was on my heart that needed to be shared."" The five-paragraph note was sent earlier this spring.
""I just think there's a lot of things going on inside and outside of our country toward Asians -- racist, bullying acts,"" Roberts said before Monday's exhibition game against the Chicago White Sox at Camelback Ranch.
""It obviously hit close to home for me, and I wanted to address it internally and show my support for the Asian Americans in our organization ... just [to let them know] we're all aware of it.""
The Times reported last week that in a survey of police departments in 16 major U.S. cities, the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, a research office at Cal State San Bernardino, found a total of 122 anti-Asian hate crimes last year -- a 149% increase from the 49 in 2019.
The numbers climbed in 15 of the 16 cities, with New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Seattle and San Jose experiencing the most significant increases and their highest tallies in at least five years.
The rise in crimes, harassment and bigotry toward Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is almost certainly related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in China and which former President Trump took to calling the ""Wuhan virus"" and the ""Chinese virus.""
Stop AAPI Hate, a tracker supported by Asian American advocacy groups, logged 1,990 anti-Asian harassment incidents and 246 assault cases in the first 10 months since it launched in March 2020.
""Unfortunately, anti-Asian sentiment is a part of American history (see 1880s, 1940s or the 1980s as examples) and it has resurfaced again during the pandemic, as some seem to blame the world's problems on one ethnic group,"" Roberts wrote in his email. ""To blame Asian Americans at all for the global pandemic is just plain wrong.""
Roberts, who last summer supported his team's refusal to play an August game against the San Francisco Giants in protest of the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, in Wisconsin, wrote that he was ""proud that the Dodgers organization, with its forward-thinking ways, has transformed its work environment by establishing better ways for all employees to be heard.""
He said Monday that his email was well-received throughout the organization.
""I think a lot of people felt heard and supported, and that was really important to me,"" Roberts said. ""It's not right treating anyone of any race that way.""

"A community's self-defense; Groups in Oakland's Chinatown offer protection, support","Do, Anh",LA Times,2021-03-19,"As the volunteers assembled to patrol a neighborhood rattled by violence, Katrina Ramos gave a quick tutorial.
People who need help will not always say so, Ramos said.
Study their faces -- do they look lost or confused? Maybe a senior citizen carrying heavy groceries might appreciate you hovering nearby, said Ramos, co-founder of Compassion in Oakland.
About 30 volunteers showed up on a recent Saturday afternoon to accompany pedestrians to their destinations in Oakland's Chinatown after a spate of attacks on elderly Asian Americans.
Even before a gunman killed eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at spas in the Atlanta area Tuesday, Chinatown was on edge, its dim sum cafes and jewelry stores decimated by the pandemic, its residents in constant fear that an assailant might sneak up behind them.
There was no proof that the attacks were racially motivated. But the vulnerability of the victims, combined with a national rise in anti-Asian hate crimes fueled in part by the coronavirus' Chinese origins, had many people asking: What can I do to help?
Horrific videos of Asian American senior citizens being shoved to the ground while walking down the street have inspired even those with no personal connection to Chinatown to work a shift or two with one of about 10 groups that have sprung up in recent months.
Similar patrols are assisting seniors in San Francisco and San Jose.
Compassion in Oakland, which formed last year in response to anti-Asian attacks, plans to start working in the San Gabriel Valley as soon as next month, and a group has been soliciting volunteers for Los Angeles' Chinatown and Little Tokyo.
Language barriers can make it challenging for volunteers to communicate with the people they are trying to help. Usually, the volunteers have no special expertise or equipment. They hope their mere presence will deter attackers.
Since the Atlanta shootings, some law enforcement agencies, including the Los Angeles Police Department, have increased patrols in Asian communities.
In February, Oakland assigned a Cantonese-speaking officer to Chinatown after previously eliminating the position.
The Compassion in Oakland volunteers came from a variety of backgrounds.
Each group of three or four would include a Mandarin or Cantonese interpreter and would patrol the streets as well as chaperone people who called a hotline.
One volunteer said he had not heard about the attacks until seeing on the news that Taiwanese American basketball player Jeremy Lin was called ""coronavirus"" on the court.
Another said friends of Asian descent have told him that their parents ""do not feel safe going out -- period.""
""The violence is popping up in unexpected places, and people aren't going to sit silent anymore,"" said Ramos, 26.
Before the nation's attention shifted to Atlanta, the Bay Area had become a hot spot of violent crimes against Asian Americans, as verbal and physical racist attacks escalated nationwide during the pandemic.
Some of the attackers have struck seemingly out of nowhere.
In San Francisco in January, an 84-year-old Thai immigrant died after he was shoved to the pavement by a man who suddenly approached him, then walked briskly away, surveillance footage showed.
On a sidewalk in Oakland's Chinatown that same month, a man in a hoodie walked up behind a 91-year-old man and shoved him, leaving him lying crumpled face down.
Arrests have been made in both attacks, with the Oakland suspect accused of two other similar attacks on the same day. It is not clear what motivated the attackers.
This week, more elderly Asian Americans were attacked in San Francisco. One woman fought off her assailant with a cane, sending him away on a stretcher.
Senior citizens who have relished the Oakland Chinatown's pedestrian-friendly environment and Chinese-speaking merchants, doing their own shopping and stopping to chat with friends playing mah-jongg in the park, are now watching their backs.
""The problem with Chinatown is it's an enclave,"" said Sonny Le, who has lived in Oakland for 40 years and is a Vietnamese interpreter for senior citizens. ""Like other enclaves, community members have shown that they could live their whole lives here without speaking English. Asians become easier targets because one, they lack language ability, and two, they don't call the police.""
Alicia Wong, 25, said her family's fortune cookie company has had to adapt to the pandemic at the same time that people they know in the small, close-knit community have become victims of the increasing street violence.
""There is fear,"" Wong said. ""My parents hear people talk about so-and-so's uncle getting mugged, and then someone else is targeted.""
Fronted by a large panda mural, Oakland Fortune Factory on 12th Street is the oldest fortune cookie company in the Bay Area, according to Wong.
With the special events business at a standstill and restaurants struggling, the company is offering curbside pickup and creative twists on the traditional fortune cookie.
Inspired by the George Floyd protests last summer, Wong and her husband, Alex Issvoran, have been selling Black Lives Matter fortune cookies with quotes from civil rights leaders and poets, instead of cryptic predictions, tucked inside.
Like many big cities, Oakland has seen a significant increase in some types of violent crime during the pandemic.
In 2020, homicides were up nearly 40% over the previous year, and assaults with a firearm were up 71%.
Officer Mae Phu returned to the Chinatown beat last month, amid the crime increase and fears about anti-Asian racism, after the Chinatown Chamber of Commerce lobbied to reinstate the position.
She works a foot patrol and is a liaison with the community, using her fluent Cantonese to help residents apply for city permits while cracking down on issues such as illegal gambling and parking violations.
Her supporters say her language skills and ties to the community have helped build trust with law enforcement.
""In my interactions with the community, I stress that it's so important that they report crimes when they happen,"" said Phu, who has been with the Oakland Police Department for more than seven years. ""They are the eyes and ears for us -- anything that they see might make a difference.""
Chinatown residents and business owners say they are grateful for the volunteer citizen patrols.
Leung Fan Chiu, 72, said it is essential ""to create a safe space and not be afraid to go out.""
""If there's somebody doing good things for our community, that's great,"" Chiu, a restaurant entrepreneur, said through a Cantonese interpreter.
But Chiu said that he and his friends are not likely to use the service -- perhaps out of a desire for independence.
Andy La, who runs the business Moment Invitations and Printing with his parents, wants protection with more teeth. He said the city should hire armed security guards, including bilingual ones.
""We are really grateful to see these citizen patrols around,"" said La, 33. ""Armed guards can be more visible. They send a visible message.""
As people waited in line for sesame balls at Tao Yuen Pastry on a recent Sunday, four men from Asians With Attitudes scanned the crowd.
Imposing in their AWA shirts and masks, they were on the lookout for people who might need help walking to the car, the bus stop or getting home.
""We don't want people to be scared. We just want them to be safe,"" said team leader Jimmy Sing Hay, a truck driver.
The group was multiethnic -- Hay is of Chinese descent, Sakhone Lasaphangthong is Laotian, John Le is Vietnamese and Seng Saephan is Mien, an ethnic group from Southeast Asia.
Lasaphangthong urged anyone who wants to bully Asian people or yell racial slurs to find another outlet.
""No need to release your temper on innocent people,"" he said. ""Keep out of the community's way.""
Lasaphangthong, a housing services director for an Oakland nonprofit, was incarcerated for two decades at San Quentin State Prison before being released in 2018.
Through the city's Community Ambassadors Program, he roams the neighborhood, greeting store owners by name, respectfully bowing his head when he passes an older person, grabbing a broom to sweep sidewalks, fixing children's bikes.
""This is my opportunity to really do my part,"" he said. ""Crime is happening and hate is spreading because people are traumatized. They're losing their livelihoods. They don't know what to do in a pandemic that has gotten worse. I think we need more communication, not policing -- but more talking to each other to figure out the situation.""
Hay said he hopes the Asians With Attitudes volunteers will be a deterrent to anyone thinking about harming a Chinatown resident.
""I'm here because the neighborhood must survive, and because when I see the faces of the old women, I think of my grandmother who used to walk everywhere collecting cans,"" he said.

"Killings spark fear, anger; Atlanta-area attacks seen as culmination of racist incidents, unnerving Asian Americans","Do, Anh; Reyes-Velarde, Alejandra; La Ganga, Maria L",LA Times,2021-03-18,"Phil Yu was not surprised that a white gunman killed eight people, six of them Asian women, at Atlanta-area spas advertising their ""Asian"" or ""international"" staff.
The worst thought he had on Wednesday, the day after the massacre, was just that, he said -- he had seen it coming.
""Being Asian in this country, no matter how long you've been here or how you got here, often feels like a constant negotiation of feeling unwelcome,"" said Yu, a blogger and commentator in Southern California who posts as Angry Asian Man.
Many Asian Americans are bristling with pain and fury, seeing the killings as a culmination of a steady drumbeat of racist attacks, with some people blaming them for the coronavirus pandemic because of its origins in China.
Law enforcement officials said that Robert Aaron Long, a 21-year-old from Woodstock, Ga., was motivated by ""sex addiction,"" that there probably wasn't a racial component to the attacks and that Tuesday was ""a bad day for him.""
Long was charged Wednesday with eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault.
But many Asian Americans saw it differently. The killing of so many Asian women, at businesses known to employ Asian workers, was a racial targeting by its very circumstances, they said.
They feared for their parents, their grandparents, their friends, their children, themselves. They lamented that hard-won immigrant dreams had been tarnished by hate. Some Asian American women shared their experiences of being dehumanized and fetishized by white men.
After all, the killings happened the same week the advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate reported that thousands of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have faced racist verbal and physical assaults since the pandemic began more than a year ago.
Also this week, former President Trump again called COVID-19 ""the China virus"" on national television.
Rep. Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park) is set to testify at a congressional hearing Thursday on the rise in hate crimes against people of Asian descent.
Chu, the first Chinese American woman elected to Congress, chairs the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.
She laid the eight deaths directly at Trump's feet, as did other Asian Americans.
""President Trump clearly stoked the flames of xenophobia against AAPIs with his rhetoric,"" Chu said Wednesday on Capitol Hill during the Democratic Caucus' weekly press conference, by calling the virus ""kung flu"" and the ""Wuhan virus,"" in addition to the ""China virus.""
""And what we saw yesterday is the result of that,"" she said.
At least four of the women killed were of Korean descent, and the attacks have been closely covered in Korean-language media.
At the Korean supermarket H Mart in Garden Grove, some shoppers debated the suspect's motives.
Some wondered why there hasn't been more focus on the shooter's ""racial targets.""
When asked for their thoughts, several older shoppers turned away.
""We don't want to be targets, too,"" one said.
At neighboring businesses, people dashed in and out for quick haircuts and steamed tofu lunches.
Elizabeth Choi was choosing a birthday cake for her uncle at the Paris Baguette bakery.
The occasional mention of anti-Asian hate incidents within her inner circle seemed ""just like casual talk, until we heard about what the guy did to the spa workers,"" said Choi, who is Korean American.
""Why would people want to harm poor workers? Something more aggressive seems to be happening -- yes, we're scared now,"" she said through an interpreter. ""Really scared. Terrified.""
The Brea homemaker, 51, said her daughter advised her not to go to ""too many areas outside of Asian areas.""
""When they're looking for a Chinese face"" to blame the pandemic on, ""any Asian face"" will do, Choi's daughter told her.
At the beginning of 2020, when news of the coronavirus was circulating in Asia and Europe but not yet in the United States, Christine Liwag Dixon braced herself for what was to come.
Dixon is mixed-race Filipina and white, a 31-year-old writer who lives in New York City. Family members and friends had shared some of the racist comments about Asians they had endured even in the very early days of the pandemic.
""I was afraid to leave the house,"" she said.
When she finally ventured out once last year for a neighborhood walk, she wondered: ""What if they say something? What if they throw something at me?""
As Dixon watched the news of the Atlanta attacks and learned about the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes, she cried.
All those times, she realized, she wasn't overreacting. When officials said the shootings weren't racially motivated, she laughed in disbelief.
""I think that's a load of b--"" she said.
Dixon and other Asian Americans are frustrated that there was not more attention on the issue.
""I have felt almost gaslit by the lack of coverage,"" she said. ""I've been sitting here all day wondering, 'Why now? Why today?' We've been talking about this for a year. Why does it take these Asian women being slaughtered for people to suddenly pay attention?""
Social media was charged with such outrage.
""In less than 48 hours, we had a historic Asian Oscar moment with multiple firsts in 93 years--then a mass shooting targeting 3 Asian-owned businesses. This is how terrorism works -- you're not allowed to feel safe, accepted, or valued. We can resist. Take up space. Make noise,"" tweeted novelist Min Jin Lee.
""Instead of centering a White Supremacist who had a 'sex addiction' (which btw you can also be a racist terrorist simultaneously), remember the real victims yesterday and their families,"" Los Angeles comedian Kristina Wong said in a tweet.
And Rep. Ted Lieu's tweets got angrier as the day went on.
At 8:27 a.m., the Torrance Democrat targeted Trump and some elected officials for creating a hostile environment with hateful anti-Asian rhetoric. ""If you are one of those officials,"" he wrote, ""please stop.""
At 9:55 a.m., he scoffed at reports that ""sex addiction"" rather than racism motivated the shooting.
Two and a half hours later, he sounded like he'd had enough, after a spokesman for the Sheriff's Department in Cherokee County, Ga., said the gunman went on a rampage because ""yesterday was a really bad day for him.""
""All of us have experienced bad days,"" Lieu tweeted. ""But we don't go to three Asian businesses and shoot up Asian employees.""
The former prosecutor said in an interview that denying a racial component to the shootings ""does not comport with the facts as we know them right now.""
""We've seen an increasing amount of violence toward Asian Americans, beginning with more verbal harassment,"" Lieu said. ""Then it escalated. You had an Asian American family in Texas last year that was stabbed, because the perpetrator thought they had spread the virus ... Then you saw elderly Asian Americans targeted. For many of us, it was not surprising to see multiple Asian victims of the crime.""
And then there's history, a reminder that what's past is prologue, from the 19th century ""yellow peril"" scapegoating and Chinese Exclusion Act to the incarceration of Japanese Americans by the U.S. government during World War II.
In 1982, a 27-year-old Chinese American man named Vincent Chin was beaten to death with a baseball bat by two unemployed Detroit autoworkers who thought he was Japanese.
It was a time when the U.S. auto industry was in decline. The attackers blamed Chin.
""When Americans feared Japan's rise in the 1980s, that caused an increase in hate crimes,"" Lieu said. ""And now, with the pandemic, you see a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans. ... When America felt threatened in the past, sometimes this country would target Asians.""

Neighbors standing guard for a harassed O.C. family; A nightly watch for Asian American household,"Fry, Hannah",LA Times,2021-03-02,"Every night, the neighbors converge on the Si family's two-story home, which has large windows and an expansive porch adorned with columns.
Some sit in camping chairs in front of the driveway. Others keep watch from their cars or patrol the nearby parks.
The Sis moved to this upscale Ladera Ranch neighborhood a few months ago, with the country deep in the COVID-19 pandemic and hate crimes against Asian Americans on the rise.
Almost immediately, teenagers swooped in for nightly visits, repeatedly ringing the doorbell, yelling and pounding on the door.
One told Haijun Si to ""go back to your country."" Another called Si's wife a pejorative slur used to describe a Chinese person. Some threw rocks.
Sometimes, the interruptions came just as the family sat down for dinner.
Other times, Si's 8-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son were jarred awake at midnight.
Si and his wife took turns standing guard outside. They installed a new fence and cameras. They called the police.
But the attacks kept coming -- until their new neighbors stepped in.
""I did not understand the extent of the harassment and how often it was occurring, at first,"" said Layla Parks, who organized the nightly neighborhood watch. ""I was immediately outraged and wanted to help.""
Violence and hate incidents directed at Asian Americans have surged across California, including in Orange County, since the beginning of the pandemic, with some blaming Asians because of the coronavirus' origins in Wuhan, China.
A recent spate of violent attacks in Oakland, San Francisco, New York City and elsewhere has attracted national attention and sparked fear among Asian Americans, though it is unclear whether some of the incidents were racially motivated.
In February in Koreatown, two men hurled anti-Asian slurs at a 27-year-old Korean American U.S. Air Force veteran, calling him ""Chinese virus"" and then swinging at him, he told KTLA.
""We're seeing an epidemic of hate right now, and we have to stand together,"" state Sen. Dave Min (D-Irvine), who represents the district just west of Ladera Ranch, said last week at an event to show support for the Si family.
While officials in Orange County are still compiling information on reports made in 2020, preliminary statistics indicate a tenfold increase in hate incidents against Asian Americans, said Alison Edwards, chief executive of the nonprofit OC Human Relations.
It's a troubling uptick that experts have blamed in part on Donald Trump's rhetoric about the pandemic, including his use of terms such as ""China virus"" and ""kung flu.""
Last year, California saw a consistent increase in hate incidents and crimes targeting Asian Americans, said Brian Levin, executive director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino.
Stereotyping and conspiracy theories identifying Asians as responsible for COVID-19 have been embraced by wide swaths of the country, Levin said, with a new Center for Public Integrity/Ipsos poll showing that nearly 1 in 4 Americans have concerns about being physically near Asian people.
A ""catalytic event"" like the pandemic, with stereotyping by political and social influencers acting as an accelerant, often leads to increased targeting of racial groups, Levin said.
The attacks against the Si family fit another pattern -- the homes of minority residents tend to be targeted by neighbors in certain age groups, Levin said.
""The most common offenders of these residential crimes are turf-oriented youths with moderate prejudices out for a thrill or older neighbors reacting to a perceived threat or change,"" Levin said.
The Si family arrived in the U.S. from China four years ago. In September, the family moved to Ladera Ranch from Corona, looking to escape the Inland Empire heat and attracted by the planned community's lush trees, neatly manicured lawns and parks.
Ladera Ranch is a friendly place, where neighbors frequently share meals or spend evenings chatting on the sidewalk as their kids play.
But, some residents say, there is a dark side to the unincorporated community of about 30,000 residents, which is about two-thirds white, 14% Latino and 13% Asian.
After the attacks started, Si installed a $3,000 wrought-iron fence around his front porch and placed floodlights and cameras around the property.
He hung a heavy chain across his driveway to keep the teens from riding their bikes up to his door.
""My kids are scared. I'm very annoyed,"" said Si, 48. ""At night, my wife and I could not sleep for more than three or four hours. Please, parents, tell your kids don't do that again.""
The Orange County Sheriff's Department has been called to the home seven times between October and February. Deputies have ramped up patrols in the area, and the department has launched an investigation, Sgt. Dennis Breckner said.
Still, the doorbell kept ringing, Si said. Nothing helped until his neighbors stepped in, vowing to put an end to the harassment.
Parks, who takes daily walks around the neighborhood, had introduced herself to Si and his family when she noticed them moving in last year.
In early February, Si reached out to Parks for advice. He had already told her about the constant doorbell ringing, and she had offered to help if needed.
At first, she figured it was a harmless childhood prank of ""ding-dong ditch.""
But as the harassment continued, including racial slurs against the family, Parks realized this was something uglier.
""It makes me physically ill,"" said Parks, 30. ""This has opened my eyes to the racism that is alive and well in Ladera Ranch. It's definitely made me sad for this community, because this is just a wonderful place full of friends and neighbors that love and care about each other.""
On a neighborhood Facebook group, Parks posted footage from Si of a recent attack and sought volunteers to guard the family's home. She wanted coverage from 6 p.m. until at least midnight. Neighbors signed up in droves.
""I got involved because I'm raising a young child here. I don't want to put a 'for sale' sign in front of my house and say, 'I can't deal with this,' "" said Emily Lippincott, 40, who lives nearby in Rancho Mission Viejo. ""I kept seeing excuses being made, 'Oh, it's just kids being kids.' No, this is months of terrorizing this poor family.""
Neighbors estimate that from 15 to 20 children have participated in the harassment, one as young as 10.
Three children have apologized, Si said. But Parks said one family sent a cease-and-desist letter after seeing their child in security video she posted on Facebook. The letter threatened her with a lawsuit if she didn't remove her post.
As the sun began to set on a recent Thursday, Parks stood outside the Sis' home, where Loden Pass curves onto Mocha Lane, assembling her troops. She kept close watch on a cluster of teenagers riding bicycles on the trails on a hillside overlooking the home.
""This is what we do all night,"" Parks said. ""We see kids and we go 'OK, are they good or are they bad?' Are they coming this way?""
Two neighbors bundled up in coats to ward off the evening chill, grabbed flashlights and took their posts on top of the hill near the home.
Others stationed themselves around the neighborhood.
""I'm so thankful for my neighbors,"" Si said.
In the two weeks or so since the volunteers have been protecting the home, the harassment has lessened, but the teens haven't been completely deterred.
One evening, a group threw rocks at Si and volunteers who were chatting on the front lawn. Sometimes they yell profanities, neighbors said.
The next day, as Chinese families around the world celebrated the Lantern Festival, hundreds of residents gathered on the grassy lawn across the street to show their support.
People held red lanterns and watched a traditional lion dance performance. Young children danced and clapped along to the music.
Min, the state senator, said the Si family should not have been made to feel unsafe and unwelcome in their own home.
""The fact of the matter is -- as we see tonight -- we outnumber them,"" Min told the crowd.",8049
"ATTACKS ON ASIAN AMERICANS; SPEAKING OF ATTACKS, FEARFULLY","Do, Anh; Reyes-Velarde, Alejandra",LA Times,2021-03-19,"Asian Americans have been dealing with rising anxiety about racial attacks since the COVID-19 pandemic began -- everything from ostracism to cruel comments and physical violence.
The shootings in Atlanta that left six Asian women dead have pushed these concerns even more to the forefront. Some say they are going out less -- and when they do, they go with other people for protection. Others say they have smartphones ready to record incidents of hate.
Here are some voices from across Southern California:

Buying pepper spray in bulk
The slightly socially distanced line at Lien Hoa BBQ Deli inched forward. Customers at the takeout joint in Orange County's Little Saigon couldn't keep themselves from getting too close to one another as they neared the cashier to pay for fragrant roast pork and duck.
People ordered juicy, sizzling meats from a heated glass display as talk swirled around headline news, including the arrest of what some described as ""the American man attacking Asian women.""
""I saw on the news that the police haven't figured out why they have the crime. Is it because someone from a minority culture does not deserve as much protection? Or is it because they deserve to be standing targets?"" said Bill Tran, a tutor from Santa Ana. ""It's ridiculous that my sister, my aunt, my grandmother, can't experience security in their own city. No one feels like they can just run outside at any time.""
Tran asked a worker at the barbecue spot whether he felt safe in light of increasing racially motivated attacks. The man shrugged, then confided that his daughters had bought a bulk supply of pepper spray.
""Even people in the ethnic enclaves are preparing,"" said Tran, 31, who is Vietnamese American. He makes sure his phone battery is always charged ""in case something happens and I need to record it. Videos will be our record.""

A buddy system for security's sake
Near the entrance of Peking Kitchen along Santa Ana's bustling 17th Street, Mary Lau and friend Lynn Porter texted family members to see whether they had any food orders.
The 20-something women say this week is a good time for comfort food, given what's happening in Southern California and around the nation.
""We're interested in the news about vaccines -- you know, how to get them -- but all we hear is about violence,"" said Lau, of Anaheim, who is Taiwanese American.
She visited Porter, who lives near the restaurant, and they decided to follow their pattern of supporting small businesses during the pandemic.
She said some of her buddies worry ""what would happen if these struggling stores become targets.""
Lau worries for the mental health of immigrant families ""just trying to live their lives and stay safe. Many of them are doing honest work. They need public support for their right to live harassment-free.""
Lau and Porter, who is half Chinese, say that when they leave home, they are never alone -- they make sure to have someone accompany them.
""In this environment, you need a buddy. Someone extra to be a witness,"" Lau said, ""in case something goes wrong.""

Raising the racism issue on Instagram
Kym Estrada, a 29-year-old business owner in Long Beach, took to Instagram to express her frustration about anti-Asian hate that has bubbled up in the last year.
""We ain't a monolith,"" she wrote from the San & Wolves vegan bakeshop account. ""We span all different parts of an entire continent. My entire life I've seen my elders and peers being treated less than because of their slanted eyes and for not properly pronouncing a word correctly because English is their second or third language!? I'm telling you right now, this and future generations of Asian Americans will not allow this hate to proceed.""
It's probably not the most strategic move to be so open about her beliefs on social media, and people send her direct messages telling her so, she said. But she doesn't care.
She wants people to know what is happening in her community, especially white folks who make up much of the vegan community and her following.
She writes from the safety of her computer, a privilege her immigrant parents didn't have.
When she heard the news Wednesday morning about the attacks on Asian women in Atlanta, she felt surprised that she was so affected because it was so distant from her. But the moment has caused memories of racism to bubble up and moved her to take a stand.
Estrada said she remembered people calling her Chinese as a kid and laughing, as though it were an insult, even though she is Filipina.
Her parents didn't teach her Tagalog for fear of her becoming alienated from her peers. They never gave her homemade lunches to take to school -- they packed Lunchables instead, so she could be like everyone else.
When she got old enough to date, she remembers being keenly aware of the fetishization of young Asian women. She made an effort to be loud and vocal, to avoid being seen as submissive and targeted by men. She avoided dating white men.
It comes as no surprise to her, then, that investigators claimed race was not a factor in the Atlanta attacks and that the suspect claimed to have a sex addiction.
""To me, it's quite obvious it was racially motivated,"" she said.
In the last year, she experienced a rise in disturbing encounters with strangers, she said.
One time, someone pushed her off a sidewalk. On another day, a man flipped her off as he drove past her. Her partner, who is also Filipino, has been told to go back to his country several times.
Despite years of racism in her own life, this is a ""lightbulb"" moment, she said.
""I have always experienced some sort of anti-Asian hate in my life, but growing up I didn't see it as hate. I saw it as people making fun of me and my parents,"" she said. ""I accepted that 'Asians look funny.' There's a lot of unlearning to be done.""
Estrada said that until now she hadn't thought much about her safety as a young Asian American business owner. She's worried more for her mother, who works as a bank teller and has had racist encounters her whole life in public spaces.
Estrada said she probably won't be talking to her parents about her fears or the violence, though.
It's a ""tricky"" conversation because of differing political views between generations, she said.

Confronting feeling of inevitability
Michelle Nguyen Bradley said she is only now learning to have conversations about race with her friends and family, despite grappling with these issues her whole life.
""The model minority myth is so bad for us because it means they think all of us are either 'Crazy Rich Asians' or we're doctors,"" said Nguyen Bradley, a 38-year-old Palms resident and online show host.
She choked up at the thought: ""Asian Americans are taught not to take up space or talk about ourselves too much. When some of us do speak up, it feels like no one is listening.""
In the past, it has been easy to bury her head in the sand, she said, because horrifying racist attacks weren't happening directly to her or on her block.
As she gets older, that's harder to do, she said.
""I was scared of it happening, and it finally did happen, but just not to me. And it's not any better,"" she said.
And she knows it could happen to her.
""You're carrying this feeling of inevitability,"" she said.
Nguyen Bradley said she's worried about her immigrant Vietnamese parents and finds it hard to broach the subject of racism in light of the Atlanta attacks.
They have mostly been staying home during the pandemic -- her father is recovering from COVID-19. But she worries about the moments they have to leave their house in a mostly white Pittsburgh neighborhood.
""Of course, I'm worried if they go to Walmart or that kind of thing,"" she said. ""Asian kids, we don't want our parents to worry. We see how far we can get without talking to them about it.""
As for herself, Nguyen Bradley started taking precautions early last year, considering the racist rhetoric at the start of the pandemic, but has since let go a little.
She would avoid walking her dog or getting the mail at night, asking her husband to do the tasks instead. She would clench her phone in her pocket while she was out and about, ready to call someone or take photos if she needed to.
But now, she's exhausted.
""I can barely get out of bed,"" she said. ""You can't live your life constantly on guard.""
Envisioning a future where she feels safe ""is very cloudy.""

Man charged with murder in Georgia spa shootings; Racism? Misogyny? Guilt? Police continue to investigate motive behind rampage that left eight dead.,"Jenny, Jarvie",LA Times,2021-03-18,"The killings on Tuesday stirred a wave of fear across Asian American communities -- already on edge after a dramatic rise in harassment and attacks against Asians in the last year.
Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said that the investigation was still in its early stages but that the suspect -- 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long, who is white -- ""did not appear to be"" motivated by racial bias.
Long, he said, confessed to the killings, telling investigators that he had a ""sexual addiction"" and wanted to get rid of the temptation that the establishments represented.
""We're still early on, still have a lot of things to process,"" Reynolds said.
Both he and Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant cautioned that no motive had been ruled out, while Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said the city was reaching out to Asian community leaders.
""Whatever the motivation was for this guy, we know that many of the victims, the majority of the victims were Asian,"" Bottoms told reporters. ""We also know that this is an issue that's happening across the country. It is unacceptable, it is hateful, and it has to stop.""
Whether the killer's motive was racism or xenophobia, misogyny or religious guilt about his sexuality, Asian advocacy groups stressed that no one should ignore the broader context of a recent surge of hate crimes and harassment targeting Asian Americans.
""That the Asian women murdered yesterday were working highly vulnerable and low-wage jobs during an ongoing pandemic speaks directly to the compounding impacts of misogyny, structural violence and white supremacy,"" Phi Nguyen, litigation director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, said in a statement.
Cherokee County Sheriff's Capt. Jay Baker said at a news conference that the spas appeared to be ""a temptation"" for Long that ""he wanted to eliminate.""
""These locations, he sees them as an outlet for him -- something that he shouldn't be doing, an issue with porn -- and that he was attempting to take out that temptation,"" Baker said.
Authorities told reporters that Long, who is from Woodstock, Ga., had been heading south with plans to carry out similar attacks in Florida.
""He was pretty much fed up and at the end of his rope,"" Baker said in comments that struck many as oddly sympathetic to a suspected killer. ""Yesterday was a really bad day for him, and this is what he did.""
After the news conference, Baker drew ire as critics noted that he appeared to endorse anti-China statements last year as he shared an image of T-shirts that echoed then-President Trump's rhetoric, referring to COVID-19 as an ""imported virus from Chy-na.""
""Love my shirt,"" Baker wrote in a Facebook post. ""Get yours while they last.'""
On Wednesday, the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office released the names of three women and one man killed in the first shooting: Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Xiaojie Yan, 49; and Daoyou Feng, 44.
The Atlanta Police Department said the victims in the two incidents that occurred within the city had yet to be positively identified, and next of kin notification had not been confirmed by the Fulton County medical examiner.
South Korea's Foreign Ministry said in a statement Wednesday that its diplomats in Atlanta have confirmed with police that four of the dead were women of Korean descent.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that President Biden had been briefed on the ""horrific shootings"" and that administration officials had been in contact with the Atlanta mayor's office and the FBI.
On Wednesday morning, Long was transported to the Cherokee County Adult Detention Center.
A 2017 graduate of Sequoyah High School in Canton, Ga., Long was described by one of his fellow students, Nicolas Straughan, as quiet, solitary and religious.
""He didn't say too much,"" Straughan recalled.
Raised as a devout Southern Baptist, Long attended services at Crabapple First Baptist Church. According to minutes taken during a Jan. 21, 2018, meeting, he was among 11 people who served on the church's Student Ministry Team.
The mission of that group, the document said, was to ""see students receive Jesus Christ as Lord, and walk in Him, being rooted in the faith.""
On Wednesday morning, the church's website and Facebook page were no longer publicly accessible. Its pastor did not respond to requests for comment.
On Instagram, Long described his interests as ""pizza, guns, drums, music, family, and God,"" the Daily Beast reported.
The attacks began about 5 p.m. Tuesday, when five people were shot at Young's Asian Massage in a strip mall in Acworth, about 25 miles northwest of downtown Atlanta, authorities said. Four people died and one person was injured.
No one was apprehended at the scene, but surveillance videos captured a suspect and a 2007 black Hyundai Tucson.
Less than 50 minutes later, Atlanta police officers responded to a report of a robbery about 25 miles south at Gold Spa in northeast Atlanta, where they found three women who had been fatally shot. As the officers responded to the scene, they received a report of shots fired at Aromatherapy Spa across the street. Inside that business, they found the body of another woman who had been shot.
At 8 p.m., Reynolds alerted the highway patrol and the Crisp County Sheriff's Office, about 150 miles south, that the suspect was headed south on Interstate 75.
The Hyundai was spotted about 8:30, and a state trooper performed a maneuver that caused the vehicle to spin out of control, Crisp County Sheriff Billy Hancock said. Long was taken into custody and transported to the Crisp County jail.
With fear spreading across spas in the city, Atlanta police upped patrols Tuesday night in the area where the killings took place and dispatched officers to check on similar businesses nearby.
On Wednesday, a throng of media gathered outside Gold Spa and Aromatherapy Spa on a busy stretch of Piedmont Road near the Buckhead district of Atlanta widely known for its array of massage businesses and adult entertainment clubs.
Many neighboring spas and massage businesses remained shuttered with their lights off.
""It's so hard,"" said Gina Ma, 50, the Chinese manager of Heavenly Feet Spa Massage, a small spa about a mile from the sites of the Atlanta killings. ""With Asian people, it's not easy in this country. Americans hate us.""
Police came to Heavenly Feet on Tuesday evening to ask workers to close. On Wednesday, a sign outside the store said ""walk-ins welcome,"" but a slow trickle of men who walked up to the doors found them shut. The spa's four employees -- two men and two women -- were afraid to come to work.
""We just got scared,"" Ma said in a telephone interview.
After the shootings, a few customers called to cancel deep-tissue foot massages. Some of her workers told her they didn't think they could work at the spa or stay in Georgia anymore.
""With COVID-19, it's not easy to find workers,"" she said. ""Today, workers -- they don't want to work the store anymore. They want to go to other states. They say Georgia is too dangerous.""
Ma, who has worked at Heavenly Feet for eight years, said that she believed Americans had long resented Asians but that Trump had exacerbated resentment during the pandemic by making false claims that Chinese people brought the coronavirus to the country.
""They think we took their jobs because we work so hard,"" she said. ""They think we brought COVID-19.""
Over the last year, cities across the U.S. have documented a rise in aggression against Asian Americans. In a survey of police departments in 16 major cities, Cal State San Bernardino's Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism found a total of 122 anti-Asian hate crimes in 2020 -- a 149% increase from 49 in 2019.
Su Choe, a 31-year-old Korean community organizer for the Asian American Advocacy Fund in Atlanta, said she and other activists had called a rapid response team Wednesday morning to plan how to respond to the shootings -- a process that involved everything from trying to figure out what had happened and settle on the correct language to describe the violent attacks to raising financial resources and trying to reach victims.
""I think it's going to be a long journey,"" she said. ""It's a big shock to have such a tragedy so near. Knowing that four of those victims are Korean women.... They're from my community. They could be one of my friends, my neighbors.""

The hate Asian Americans face,None,LA Times,2021-03-03,"A 91-year-old man shoved to the ground in Oakland's Chinatown. A dead cat left at a family-run butcher shop in Sacramento. A teacher's aide beaten with his own cane in Rosemead. A fire and vandalism at a Buddhist temple in Little Tokyo. The harassment of an immigrant family in Ladera Ranch. A Sacramento high school teacher making disparaging slant-eyed gestures during a Zoom call.
These horrific incidents all occurred within the last month. And the trend isn't limited to California. Attacks on Asian Americans have drawn an outcry in New York City as well. Voice of America has documented similar surges in hate crimes in Boston, Seattle and other cities.
The increase in attacks over the last year has no single cause. But there can be no doubt that former President Trump's invective against immigrants and against China -- he repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as ""the Chinese virus"" -- contributed to an atmosphere of xenophobia and scapegoating. It is only the latest in a long and ugly history of hostility toward Asians, marked by such outrages as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II.
Today, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are the fastest-growing minority group in America. The community is characterized by staggering diversity.
One of the few things that unites this group's members, sadly, is being the target of hate crimes. The anti-Asian violence does not discriminate by national origin; for example, a 27-year-old Korean American was assaulted last month in Koreatown by two men who allegedly accused him of carrying COVID-19 and told him to ""go back to China."" Or consider Vincent Chin, a Chinese American, who was beaten to death in 1982 by autoworkers angry about economic competition from Japan.
That's one reason Trump's tough-on-China rhetoric was so harmful. As China continues to grow in wealth and influence, so too does mistrust in the United States -- some of it justified -- about the Chinese regime's intentions. But as the persecution of German Americans in World War I and Japanese Americans in World War II shows, rivalry with a foreign power can easily spill over into terrible abuses at home.
There is some good news. The recently enacted California pandemic aid bill includes $1.4 million to support research by the Asian American Studies Center at UCLA and data reporting by Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition of advocacy groups established a year ago to collect information on racially motivated violence and harassment. Hate crimes have been underreported because many Asian Americans have limited English proficiency or do not trust the police.
It's also good that activists and entertainers, such as Daniel Dae Kim, have spoken out against anti-Asian hate. But more leadership will be needed to prevent this latest trend from getting worse -- or turning deadly",2870
"HATE CRIMES AGAINST ASIANS CLIMB; Fifteen such offenses were reported in Los Angeles in 2020, compared with seven in 2019.","Rector, Kevin ",LA Times,2021-03-03,"Hate crimes against Asian Americans and other members of the Asian and Pacific Islander communities in Los Angeles rose sharply in 2020, mirroring a national trend and causing concern among police and local advocacy organizations.
According to a report presented to the Los Angeles Police Commission on Tuesday, there were 15 anti-Asian hate crimes reported in the city in 2020, compared with seven in 2019, marking a 114% increase.
There were also nine hate ""incidents"" -- or bigoted encounters that don't rise to the level of a crime -- compared with seven in 2019, police said. Several anti-Asian hate crimes have occurred so far this year.
Police and advocates said they believe many more incidents occur than are reported, and that they are working to better identify, track and record such encounters and conduct more outreach in local Asian communities to encourage reporting by victims.
They say the recent hate has been fueled in part by misguided notions of blame for the COVID-19 pandemic, in which early cases arose in China. They said such hatred has at times been spurred by national political figures like former President Trump, and it is up to local leaders to push back.
""Unfortunately we're a year into this pandemic and we are starting to see again a rise in anti-Asian hate and some very violent attacks that have occurred in our community in the last month or two,"" said Connie Chung Joe, CEO of the group Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Los Angeles.
She cited among other incidents a Korean American U.S. military veteran recently being attacked in Koreatown. She also said she had spoken to a woman who was harassed at a bar but told by police that they couldn't do anything about it other than offer to walk her to her car.
She said many incidents are going unreported, in part because of language barriers in immigrant communities, and called on the LAPD to increase training for officers to know ""how to identify when a crime rises to the level of a hate crime and report it accordingly so that the public gets a full report on the severity of the problem.""
""When victims are brave enough to come forward and share their experiences with the police, having the police say that nothing can be done discourages victims and their communities from relying on the police again,"" she said. ""This contributes to the underreporting problem.""
Michael Lawson, president of the Los Angeles Urban League, said victims are also discouraged from reporting such crimes when they perceive or see bias being espoused by officers.
Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and cofounder of Stop AAPI Hate, said her group has tracked thousands of crimes and other incidents targeting members of Asian and Pacific Islander communities nationwide and what is occurring in Los Angeles seems to mirror the broader trend.
San Francisco police said Tuesday that, based on preliminary data for 2020, hate crimes against Asian Americans rose from six in 2019 to nine in 2020.
The Orange County Sheriff's Department did not respond to a request for 2020 hate crime data Tuesday, but Alison Edwards, chief executive of the nonprofit OC Human Relations, said preliminary data indicated a tenfold increase in hate incidents against Asian Americans.
Brian Levin, executive director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino, said such incidents increased across the state.
Police and other service providers, including those whose job it is to ensure civil rights aren't violated, must intervene to turn the tide, Kulkarni said.
LAPD Asst. Chief Beatrice Girmala said the department has increased training on hate incidents in recent years, including input from an LGBTQ working group, and takes hate crimes seriously.
Girmala said the department would be hosting a forum soon to discuss issues specific to the Asian and Pacific Islander communities and asked community leaders to work with her to ensure that victims who contact the police have access to additional resources such as counseling.
""We do not stand for or tolerate any acts of violence, any behavior that seeks to promote or give a so-called safe haven to those who promote hate,"" Girmala said.
Within the department, Girmala said, Chief Michel Moore has made it clear that officers who exhibit their own biases will be dealt with severely.
""His highest priority is a zero tolerance for any type of behavior that is bias driven, that may even have the appearance of being bias driven, in any manner, shape or form,"" Girmala said.
In addition to anti-Asian crimes, hate crimes against other groups also increased last year. Anti-Hispanic hate crimes rose nearly 36%, to 57 incidents in 2020, and anti-Black hate crimes rose more than 5%, to 77, the LAPD's report found.
Hate crimes against gay men jumped nearly 30%, to 70 crimes in 2020, and anti-transgender hate crimes rose about 26%, to 29 incidents last year.
Hate crimes against the Jewish community declined.
Members of the Police Commission said they stand against hate and will continue to monitor the data and do what they can to ensure that police are trained to identify such incidents when they occur and respond to them appropriately.
""It will not be tolerated,"" said Commissioner William Briggs, of hate-fueled crime in L.A. ""We need to take positive steps as a community and as a police force to help stem this tide of hatred.""

"Depression, anxiety after Atlanta; Toll from spa attacks amplifies inequities in mental health care for Asian communities.","Evans, Marissa",LA Times,2021-03-31,"When Linda Yoon, a Korean American psychotherapist, heard about the Atlanta-area spa shootings two weeks ago, she braced for what would probably come next.
After the killing of eight people, including six Asian women, she and the other therapists in her Los Angeles-area practice were virtually flooded with calls and emails from would-be clients. Ninety percent of them were Asian people mentioning the shooting or racial trauma.
The calls came not just from L.A. or across California, but also from Alabama, Kansas and even Georgia, with desperate requests for an Asian therapist who could help them cope.
The out-of-state inquiries were not new for Yoon, who started the Yellow Chair Collective with a partner in 2019. But due to overwhelming demand and licensing restrictions that limit practitioners' ability to treat people in other states, Yoon and her fellow therapists felt a sense of helplessness, realizing they could not serve everyone.
""We've been getting a lot more inquiries than we could accommodate,"" Yoon said. ""We've been getting a lot of inquiries out of state where they don't have a lot of Asian providers and that's been hard ... we had to turn some Asian clients away.""
The Atlanta-area shootings amplified the longtime mental health crisis in Asian American and Pacific Islander communities after a year of anti-Asian violence and grief over COVID-19 deaths.
Experts and advocates say these events also helped expose other shortcomings in the healthcare system particular to Asian Americans, including a lack of Asian mental health providers, ongoing language barriers and ignorance of Asian culture, histories and the decades of violence they've faced in America.
During the pandemic, Asian communities are also dealing with displacement from loss of income or the need to move, being without usual support systems because of social distancing and fear of violence inspired by bigoted rhetoric that Asian people are responsible for the coronavirus.
""It's just making a lot of mental health challenges worse,"" said Mandy Diec, California policy director for the Washington, D.C.-based Southeast Asia Resource Action Center. ""It's really nothing new, but it's something reinforcing a lot of the trauma and it's unfortunate that the biggest problem is that we live in a healthcare system that doesn't account for the needs of our community.""
Depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, unresolved trauma and cultural stigma about mental illness are longtime concerns in Asian communities.
Nearly 44% of Asian Americans who had a past-year major depressive episode received treatment for it, according to the 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Refugees from Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam are most at risk for PTSD from the traumas of genocide, war and assimilation to resettlement in the U.S., according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
A report released last week by the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center found that 29% of respondents faced challenges due to an insufficient understanding of mental health services and how to navigate the mental health system.
Survey participants said they care most about someone understanding their cultural values, roles and expectations, a welcoming environment and an understanding of their community's history.
Diec said younger generations are ""cultural brokers"" between older adults and the mental health system, helping them make appointments, research therapists and receive care.
She said Asian American and Pacific Islander communities revolve around family and the collective community, making mental health -- often treated individually -- a challenging subject to broach because it's not seen as ""necessary or really worthy of talking about.""
In 2019, there were 4,887 Asian psychologists across the U.S., making up just 4% of the workforce, according to a report from the American Psychological Assn.
Yoon had to find a therapist for her mom in 2019 when she was experiencing depression.
Her mother speaks Korean and finding a therapist in San Diego who speaks the same language was challenging. Given her background, Yoon said she did the therapist consultations and made the appointments.
Yoon said it's common to see young Asian people asking for a consultation or making appointments on behalf of their parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles.
""Because of their generation, therapy wasn't even an option, they didn't think about it,"" Yoon said. ""They're still hesitant, so younger people are trying to bring that idea to their parents.""
To meet the increased need of the community, Yoon and her staff initially offered two free support groups after the Atlanta-area shootings. They filled up quickly. The practice is hosting a workshop for Asian parents on how to talk about anti-Asian racism with their children and a support group for Asian American teens.
They're also offering coaching group services on topics such as ""How to find your voice as an Asian American"" and ""How to advocate for yourself and your community.""
But Yoon says her Asian clients are struggling to process what happened in the Atlanta area and the attacks that have long occurred in their communities.
Often they've been told by older generations to ignore the racist attacks, work harder and ""don't rock the boat,"" Yoon said. Now they're trying to find the words to explain the traumas of feeling culturally and emotionally invisible. Her female clients are feeling especially isolated.
""A lot of them were telling me that a lot of companies didn't acknowledge what happened,"" Yoon said of her clients. ""They're feeling the tragedy but their companies, their own managers, are going like it's just a normal day and that was on St. Patrick's Day so people were celebrating ... they're really struggling, and they feel like they want to cry and it's like, 'OK, when I go to therapy, I can cry.' ""
Kate Wadsworth, clinical director for the Center for Empowering Refugees and Immigrants in Oakland, worried how the Atlanta-area shootings would trigger PTSD among her Southeast Asian clients.
During the pandemic, the organization has held virtual sessions four times a week to talk about how people are coping with their grief and isolation, and the violence.
As the only white person on the center's staff, Wadsworth said she works with interpreters who are often refugees, immigrants or children of survivors. Clients can always work with someone of Asian descent or a refugee, but Wadsworth said interpreters serve to provide potential clients with ""an unspoken 'OK, you can trust her.' ""
Wadsworth said it's harder for members of the community to open up about their grief and trauma if they have to first explain the history of genocide in their country.
""It's really important to be humble and acknowledge there may be things I don't understand because I'm white,"" Wadsworth said. ""Your job is not to teach me, but I'm here to learn about you and what works for you and your culture ... it's true cultural humility.""
Kao Saechao, specialty mental health division director for Asian Health Services in Oakland, said the community health center offers mental health services through more than 30 mental health workers and in 14 Asian languages.
Patients coming in are often dealing with trauma, depression and anxiety. The center, which offers medical, mental health and dental care, serves about 50,000 people from low-income communities each year.
Since the Atlanta shooting, the center has seen an uptick in requests for mental health services.
""The stigma is still very present in our community. I think there's still a lot of work that could be done to improve that,"" Saechao said. ""And also, somehow just normalizing mental health services and actually educating people on what that means and the benefits of mental health care.""
Yoon's practice will soon have 12 therapists on staff and currently offers therapy services in Cantonese, Mandarin, Korean, Spanish and Vietnamese.
But Yoon often thinks about the people they've had to turn away. While the practice tries to make referrals to therapists living closer to people making out-of-state inquiries, Yoon says they often have full client lists too.
Recently Yoon and her business partner went to Big Bear with their families to decompress and enjoy the snow. But they still found themselves responding to emails and tinkering with how they'll run the upcoming support groups.
""We just can't take time off right now,"" Yoon said. ""I feel like we need to be there.""

ATTACKS AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS; Man hurls cusses at rally; Authorities will probe anti-China rant at Diamond Bar protest as a hate incident.,"Pinho, Faith E; Miller, Leila",LA Times,2021-03-23,"Authorities are investigating as a hate crime an incident in which a man disrupted a protest against anti-Asian racism in Diamond Bar on Sunday by driving through a group of protesters while yelling insults about China.
Video posted to Instagram showed a black Honda Civic sitting at a stoplight at Grand Avenue and Diamond Bar Boulevard as about a dozen protesters crossed the street.
The driver then headed through an opening between the protesters and pulled a U-turn while yelling, ""F-- China!""
Another video showed the man, described by a sheriff's official as a white man in his 50s, standing outside his car, waving his hand and repeating the obscenity.
Deputy Trina Schrader of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Information Bureau said the department was investigating the man's actions as a ""hate incident,"" rather than a crime, because there were no injuries or property damage. Later Monday, Sheriff Alex Villanueva tweeted that the incident was being investigated as a hate crime
Dozens of people gathered in Diamond Bar on Sunday with colorful signs bearing such slogans as ""Stop Asian Hate"" and ""End the Violence Against Asians."" The protest was one of several in Southern California following the shootings last week by a white man at Atlanta-area spas that killed eight people, including six Asian women.
Orange County resident Lowell Renold, 25, said protesters filled every corner of the Diamond Bar intersection. Standing with a sign that said, ""Los Angeles County stands united against hate,"" Renold joined others in chanting, ""No justice, no peace.""
Although he is not Asian, Renold said he attended the protest to say, ""Enough is enough"" to white supremacy, hatred and bigotry.
""There was just so much love and support in the air,"" Renold said.
He did not witness the incident involving the Honda Civic driver but said it was ""really disheartening and sad"" that anyone would make racist comments at a rally against racism.
""I don't understand how you can look at something like that and feel angry and feel like you're being attacked,"" he said.
The protest also addressed other attacks against Asian Americans that have escalated during the COVID-19 pandemic, with some people blaming them for the virus because of its origins in China.
A report by the advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate documented thousands of racist verbal and physical attacks against Asian Americans since the coronavirus shutdowns began last March.
On Thursday, a Daly City woman became another victim in a string of violent attacks against Asian seniors in the Bay Area. A security camera showed a person running up to the elderly woman, knocking her to the ground and grabbing her possessions before running away.
In its wake, Daly City residents organized a ""Stop Asian Hate"" protest Sunday.
Meanwhile, more than a dozen leaders and members of Los Angeles' Asian and Pacific Islander community gathered for a media briefing in Koreatown on Monday afternoon to denounce anti-Asian violence and to encourage residents to report hate incidents. Some held signs that said, ""Stop AAPI Hate"" and ""No Place for Hate.""
""We all have to raise our voice,"" said Peter Kang, president of the Korean American Chamber of Commerce of L.A. ""Everyone has to remember that all lives matter.... Black, Asian, Latino, white -- we all live together here.""
Los Angeles Police Department Deputy Chief Blake Chow said that since the shooting in Georgia, the department has increased patrols in neighborhoods with many Asian businesses, and emphasized that the LAPD tracks both hate crimes and hate incidents.
John Lee, a Korean American on the L.A. City Council, said that while growing up, when people asked him what ethnicity he was, he would say American because he felt he had to emphasize that he could belong to both nationalities.
""We cannot allow this effort to die down,"" he said of the Asian community's work to highlight anti-Asian violence. ""We cannot and will not be silent any longer.""

"My anxiety at being Asian has morphed into fear; The increase in assaults is shocking, but not surprising",Sharon Kim Soldati ,LA Times,2021-03-03,"My parents live on the outskirts of Atlanta, and I am worried about them.
Since the start of the pandemic, there has been a significant uptick in hate crimes against Asians in America. In the past few weeks, we've seen horrifying reports of Asian Americans being harassed and punched, an elderly man thrown to the ground and killed in San Francisco, another slashed in the face and left to bleed inside a New York City subway car, as well as countless videos of enraged people shouting at Asian Americans to go back to their countries and even spitting in their faces.
The recent turn of events is shocking, but not surprising. For many Asian Americans, anti-Asian sentiments are borne in silence and isolation. I grew up mostly being embarrassed about my Korean heritage. In the U.S., we Koreans have to prove that we are American, even if we were born and raised here, by pushing ourselves to excel at school and work. As children, some of us refused to learn to speak Korean. By doing so, we shed much of our ethnic identities.
I was always acutely aware of how I should try to fit in. When I was 4 years old, we moved to Vancouver, Canada, where we lived in a predominantly white neighborhood. When I started elementary school in the late 1970s, many people had never heard of Korea. Another Asian girl in my class by the name of Ming Ming would sit at the corner of one of the long lunch tables with her thermos of noodles. The other children would wince at the smell. I did not fare better. Next to her, I would open up my doshirak, a
Korean lunch box packed with fried rice, meat and vegetables and a pair of chopsticks that fit neatly inside. Mimicking the other children, I would scrunch up my nose at my own lunchbox and pretend that its contents were equally offensive to me.
When I got home, I cornered my mother. Why couldn't she just pack me a normal lunch like peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches?
""How is that even healthy?"" my mother countered. ""There are no vegetables in there!"" But my mother obliged, and to my relief, I was sent to school with a Western-styled sandwich.
One of my mother's favorite words in Korean is cham-ah, meaning to endure. It is what she and her family had to do when they escaped North Korea during the winter of 1950. Traveling on foot from Pyongyang to Seoul, they crossed icy rivers and ran for cover from bombings and artillery fire before riding on the roof of a U.S. military cargo train from Seoul to Daegu.
My parents arrived in Los Angeles in the 1970s and worked as janitors at the Shubert Theater, saving money to buy their first grocery store in a Spanish-speaking neighborhood. Unable to secure a permanent visa for our family, we moved to Canada, where they cleaned fish at a local market and bought a hardware store. When my mom got her medical technologist certification, she found a job in New York and we moved back to the States. Through all of their struggles to make ends meet, they instilled in us
the concept of enduring. If someone mistreated us, we were told not to make a fuss. Cham-ah. When my schoolteacher told my parents that my Korean name was too difficult to pronounce, they consulted our church minister, who provided us with Americanized names. Giving up our Korean names was a small price to pay to fit in. Cham-ah.
Even today, I will rarely speak out when someone throws out a racial slur. I think to myself, is it really worth it? It could be so much worse. Cham-ah. At the counter of a sandwich shop, the woman who rings me up says very loudly with exaggerated enunciation how much my order costs, holding up seven fingers, in case I might be hearing impaired in addition to not understanding English. Cham-ah.
All my life I felt like being Asian in America was a shortcoming I had to make up for by working hard and not sticking out too much. This week, this low-grade anxiety has morphed into actual fear. Fear for my aging parents, relatives and their friends.
I am hoping the coming herd immunity against the coronavirus might bring with it a new era of racial tolerance. That vanquishing COVID-19 might also mean diminishing these racial attacks, particularly on our elders whom we have been raised to respect and honor. But we can't wait for that to happen. It is time to speak up about anti-Asian hate crimes.

"A wave of hate against Asians; Study documents thousands of verbal, physical attacks in U.S. during pandemic.","Do, Anh",LA Times,2021-03-17,"Since coronavirus shutdowns began last March, thousands of Asian Americans have faced racist verbal and physical attacks or have been shunned by others, according to a study released Tuesday.
The report by Stop AAPI Hate documents 3,795 racially motivated attacks against Asian Americans from March to February, noting that the number is likely a fraction of the attacks that occurred, because many were not reported to the group.
Stop AAPI Hate formed last March in response to attacks related to the perception that Asians were responsible for the coronavirus because of its origins in Wuhan, China. The group did not collect data in previous years to show whether attacks against Asians have increased during the pandemic.
About 68% of the anti-Asian incidents documented in the study were verbal harassment, 21% were shunning and 11% were physical assaults.
About 9% of the incidents were civil rights violations such as workplace discrimination or being refused service at a business. Nearly 7% were online harassment.
Most of the incidents occurred at businesses or on public streets.
More than two-thirds of the attacks in the study were reported by women.
More than 40% were reported by Chinese Americans, 15% by Korean Americans and 8% by Filipino Americans.
""We ask policymakers at the local, state and national level to partner with us on implementing community-based solutions that will help ensure Asian Americans have equal rights and access to opportunities,"" said Manjusha Kulkarni, a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate.
The report includes descriptions of the incidents provided by victims.
At a subway station in Annandale, Va., an Asian American woman was on an escalator when a man repeatedly punched her in the back and followed her, fake-coughing and shouting ""Chinese b--.""
In August, Hong Lee was waiting for tacos at a restaurant in the Pico-Union area when a stranger approached her, handed her his business card and asked her to lunch.
She said she was married and declined.
Then, she said in an interview with The Times, ""the man started screaming at me, telling me to go back to Asia, followed by two minutes of calling me every single derogatory word you could imagine.""
Lee, a Vietnamese American nonprofit worker in her mid-30s, remembered feeling cornered by the man and ""asking for help, but no one stepped up.""
Finally, an employee asked the man to move to the other side of the room. He collected his food and walked out, Lee said.
A police officer refused to take an incident report because ""he said, 'This happens all the time and there's nothing I can do,' "" she recalled. ""He said there's no crime here.""
Lee, a mother of two, talked with her Korean American husband about whether to publicize what happened to her. She decided to encourage others ""not to take this quietly.""
Her video of the incident, which she posted on Instagram and Facebook, went viral. She now volunteers as an ambassador for Los Angeles County's ""L.A. vs. Hate"" campaign, connecting victims to social services and mental health resources.
She also reported the incident to Stop AAPI Hate.
""It's in our culture just to keep our heads down, and we don't want to talk about things that humiliate us,"" she said. ""But why do we need to be passive?""
Attacks against senior citizens in the Bay Area and New York City have intensified the outcry against anti-Asian hate crimes, though it is unclear whether many of those incidents were racially motivated.
""We need to reckon with both the historical and ongoing impact that racism, hate and violence are having on our community, especially on women, youth and seniors, who are particularly vulnerable,"" said Cynthia Choi, a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate.
Choi and others appealed to the public to report hate attacks.
Russell Jeung, a Stop AAPI Hate co-founder and professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University, referred to former President Trump's use of the terms ""kung flu"" and ""China virus.""
Hatred against Asian Americans should not ""be a legacy of COVID-19 or the last presidential administration,"" Jeung said.
About 4 in 10 Asian Americans said people have acted uncomfortable around them because of their race since the pandemic started, and 31% said they have been subjected to racial slurs or jokes, according to a Pew Research Center study.
In Los Angeles, hate crimes against Asians and Pacific Islanders surged in 2020.
Advocates and law enforcement officials say many more incidents occur than are reported.
After Lee publicized her case, five other women came forward describing a similar attacker, who is now under investigation.
""There's no sense in staying silent,"" Lee said. ""No one should stay fearful.""",4696
CITY & STATE; Hundreds in S.F. rally against racism,"Lin, Shannon; Blume, Howard",LA Times,2021-03-21,"Hundreds of Asian Americans and their supporters gathered Saturday in San Francisco's Chinatown, part of a string of rallies across the country in response to last week's shooting rampage in the Atlanta area, which claimed eight lives, including six women of Asian descent.
The San Francisco event was large, colorful, almost festive -- but marked by testimonials of anguish and recollections of racist encounters. It came as the nation has seen a surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans since the pandemic began. The coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan, China.
Those gathered Saturday held signs with such messages as ""We are NOT a Virus"" and ""Stop the Violence.""
Some sang songs to console each other, and others gathered on the square painted butterflies and assembled kites, symbols of peace. Speakers addressed the crowd in English and Cantonese, calling for unity and respect for the victims.
""How many more of our people's blood, black eyes, swollen faces, broken bones, must happen before we will be visible?"" said Ashlyn So, 13. ""Before we will feel safe? Before we will be an equal?""
The teenager said later that she felt a ""surge of energy"" to speak out about anti-Asian racism after speaking with the daughter of San Francisco resident Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thai American who died after an assailant violently shoved him to the ground in January.
A similar demonstration was held Saturday night in Alhambra. Hundreds of people gathered at a ""Stop Asian Hate"" vigil at Almansor Park to honor the shooting victims.
""We will not be silent against the gun violence,"" organizer Betty Hang wrote on Facebook. ""We want to remember the importance of uniting -- for love, understanding and compassion of our community.""
In Georgia, Robert Aaron Long, 21, who is white, is charged with murder in the killings of eight people on Tuesday at Gold Spa and Aromatherapy Spa in Atlanta and Young's Asian Massage, 25 miles away. The vigils on Saturday included one in Atlanta outside the state Capitol. Among the speakers were the state's recently elected Democratic senators, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock.
Long told authorities he was not targeting Asians, but in San Francisco on Saturday, participants of Asian descent said they could not avoid seeing themselves in the victims.
Crystal Liang said she wondered whether she might be next.
""I don't know what I would do if something like that happens to me, but that's why I decided to come out here today as an Asian woman and voice my anger,"" said Liang, an instructor at a San Francisco day-care center and a recent immigrant from Guangdong, China.
Before the pandemic, she had never attended protests or political events, but that's changed in recent months. The need to be more vocal about racism against Asian Americans has been a long time coming, she said.
""I'm furious.... Even before COVID-19, when we went out on walks or when we were on the bus, people would scream at us to 'go back to China,' "" Liang said.
Since coronavirus shutdowns began last March, thousands of Asian Americans have faced racist verbal and physical attacks or have been shunned by others, according to a report released Tuesday.
Sasanna Yee connected such data to her family's personal experience when she stepped onto a makeshift stage in San Francisco to recall her grandmother Yik Oi Huang. She said her grandmother died last year of complications from injuries sustained in a beating in January 2019.
""I come out and I show up time and again to be with our community because it's healing, because I know I cannot carry this pain by myself,"" said Yee, a yoga teacher and organizer of the Bay Area organization Asians Belong. ""I am hurting. I've had nightmares: people breaking into my house and holding a gun against me.""

ATTACKS ON ASIAN AMERICANS; 'I'm scared I won't be believed'; Advocates hope national focus will encourage more to report anti-Asian hate,"Miller, Leila",LA Times,2021-03-21,"Jeongyeon Lee was walking from her car to a McDonald's in La Habra recently when she heard someone nearby say ""China"" or "" chinita."" She turned around, confronting two men sitting in the parking lot.
Speaking in Spanish, they called her "" chinita cochina,"" which translates in English as dirty little Chinese girl.
""I told them, 'I am not Chinese, I am Korean,' "" and they responded with another racial slur, Lee said.
Lee, 49, who majored in Spanish in college, was shaken, and she thought about recent disturbing stories in the news about hate-motivated attacks against Asian Americans. She reported the March 11 incident in Orange County on a portal that Radio Korea, a Korean-language station in Los Angeles, had created the day before.
In the wake of Tuesday's shootings at three Atlanta-area spas -- leaving eight people dead, six of them Asian women -- many advocates hope that the national focus on a rise in hate crimes and incidents against Asian Americans will empower more people to report their experiences and lead to better access to government resources for victims.
""Right now, we have to speak up,"" Lee said. ""I really think we have to get involved and elevate our voice and make this issue a big priority.""
Anti-Asian harassment and violence have surged across California since the beginning of the pandemic, often rooted in the misconception that the Asian American community is at fault for the global spread of the coronavirus. The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China.
In San Francisco this month, an assailant repeatedly struck a Filipino Chinese man in the face as he was heading back to his office from a lunch break in Chinatown -- breaking bones and bruising his eyes. In Oakland in January, a man walked up behind a 91-year-old man in Chinatown and shoved him to the ground. Suspects have been arrested in both cases.
According to a report presented to the Los Angeles Police Commission in March, 15 anti-Asian hate crimes were reported in the city in 2020, compared with seven in 2019, marking a 114% increase. There were also nine hate ""incidents"" -- encounters that don't rise to the level of a crime -- compared with seven in 2019, police said.
The day of the Atlanta rampage, the advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate released a report documenting nearly 4,000 racially motivated attacks against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders nationwide that had been reported during the pandemic.
Issues with data collection among law enforcement agencies have made it difficult to capture the full scope of hate crimes. A 2018 California state auditor report, for example, found that policing agencies had misidentified some hate crimes as hate incidents and weren't conducting enough outreach to encourage the public to report potential crimes.
Connie Chung Joe, chief executive of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Los Angeles, named a variety of challenges that inhibit reporting, including language barriers, fear of retaliation, mistrust in the police, immigration status and shame for being humiliated.
""I've had people say to me that I'm scared to report it because I'm scared I won't be believed,"" she said. ""Particularly for women, there's a big fear of victim blaming.""
But advocates say that heightened attention to the issue may bring about changes, such as more people reporting and improved training for police officers to identify hate crimes.
Manjusha Kulkarni, a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate and executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, said there needs to be more focus on building a social infrastructure to respond to hate incidents. Community members who experience attacks, she said, may want mental health services.
She's also pushing for stronger civil rights laws and federal, local and state partnerships to track hate incidents that aren't crimes.
Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino, said people should take advantage of the momentum by demanding that state legislators support an expansion of the groups covered under hate crime laws in certain states that offer less protection.
""When there's a tragedy -- and there's enough of a groundswell of revulsion and failure of the law -- it produces some possible results, but only if those of us who are concerned sustain the effort,"" he said.
Community groups in L.A. and across the country are working to increase awareness of hate incidents and reporting. Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Los Angeles is running social media campaigns to encourage people to report hate incidents to the organization and to offer bystander intervention training.
Chung Joe said advocates are also working with the LAPD to develop small resource cards in Korean, Chinese and Tagalog with information on mental health, housing and legal services for victims.
""When it's a hate incident, sometimes the officers say there's nothing we can do because it's not a crime and we can't arrest,"" she said. ""We want the community to feel they are getting something substantive from the officer.""
In the aftermath of the Atlanta shootings, LAPD Deputy Chief Blake Chow said the department contacted community groups to help translate a pamphlet on reporting hate crimes and incidents into Korean and other Asian languages. It has also increased patrols in areas of the city with heavy concentrations of Asian and Pacific Islander businesses, such as Koreatown and Chinatown.
Chow said the Los Angeles Police Department wants to know about hate incidents that don't rise to the level of crimes so that it can have a better understanding of what's happening in the community and refer victims to services.
Steve Kang, the director of external affairs for the Koreatown Youth and Community Center, said that since the shootings, he's gone on Korean-language radio stations to encourage people to report hate incidents and to voice support for AB 557, a bill introduced in February whose sponsor hopes will create a statewide hotline for victims and witnesses to report hate crimes to the California Department of Justice.
""Instead of reporting to authorities or seeking assistance, we tend to keep it to ourselves,"" he said. ""I've been encouraging our community that that is no longer the status quo.""
Several years ago, he had kept silent himself. While perusing a mall in Brea with his wife, a woman randomly shouted at him in front of a Macy's to ""go back to China.""
""This is my country and I was flabbergasted,"" he said. ""I didn't share it with anybody; I thought that was taboo. But now my mind has changed.""

ATTACKS ON ASIAN AMERICANS; Promising to 'use my voice better'; Racist violence inspires some in community who kept quiet to speak up,"Mejia, Brittny",LA Times,2021-03-28,"For some Asian Americans who have erred on the side of caution when confronted by racism, this year has changed everything.
As the coronavirus pandemic worsened, then-President Trump referred to the ""kung flu"" and ""Chinese virus.""
Asian Americans were accused by strangers of spreading the virus and told to go back where they came from. Elderly Asians walking down the street were violently shoved to the ground by strangers who approached them with no clear motive other than to hurt a vulnerable person.
The hate and violence culminated last week in a massacre at Atlanta-area spas. A 21-year-old gunman killed eight people, including six Asian women, telling investigators he was battling a sex addiction and trying to eliminate temptation.
Here are the stories of three Asian Americans who have dealt with racism all their lives and are now determined to speak up.

Picking his battles? Not anymore
When Christopher Kim was in first grade, a kid on the playground called him ""Chinese boy.""
He complained to a teacher, but she looked at him and walked away.
His parents said, ""Try not to let that worry you too much. They're just ignorant. They just don't know any better.""
There were few other Asians in Shreveport, La., where Kim was born and raised.
He tried to explain that he was of Korean descent, but his classmates only seemed familiar with China and Japan.
""Early on, there was that feeling of exclusion and being the perpetual foreigner, so to speak,"" he said.
In sixth grade, a group of white boys surrounded him and taunted him for being Asian.
Kim wanted to hit them. But he knew that would not end well.
""I did my best to just keep my mouth shut. I knew they wanted a reaction out of me. So I just kind of took it,"" he said. ""It was a very humiliating experience, but I knew from every angle it was a losing situation. I knew it was just something I had to suffer through in silence.... I knew if it escalated beyond the verbal harassment, it was going to end badly, really it was going to end even worse than the harassment. It's one of those things where you really have to pick your battles.""
Kim, 34, attended graduate school in public health at UCLA and lived in San Diego until recently.
Last November, he moved to Dallas, partly to be closer to his parents. The recent attacks on elderly Asians have unnerved him. And he is no longer suffering in silence.
""I'm at the point in my life where I'm kind of like, 'This has gone far enough.' I can't stay silent anymore, in the background,"" he said. ""I have to speak up and really say something about this and really raise awareness that this is a serious issue and it does cost people their lives.""

'If you don't speak up, people are going to bully you'
Last February in San Mateo, Renee Lau's grandmother returned from walking the dog with a disturbing story.
A white woman had approached her and asked, ""Do you speak English? Are you Chinese?""
She speaks little English, so she could only nod in response. Then, the woman said, ""Go back to China.""
Lau, 28, marched outside with her grandmother looking for the woman.
After spotting her, Lau initially took a cautious tone: ""Excuse me, did you say this to my grandma?""
""Well she doesn't speak English, does she?"" the woman responded.
""That doesn't matter, that's rude,"" Lau said. ""You just went up to her and said all this rude stuff to her because of the fact that she can't defend herself.""
The woman then said your ""kind of people"" are corrupt and that ""no one wants you here -- you have to go back to China.""
Lau's grandmother urged her to leave and ""not make it a big deal.""
Instead, Lau snapped a photo of the woman and reported her to the apartment's management. Nothing happened.
But the dynamic changed between her grandmother and the harasser. Her grandmother said she felt more confident after Lau's defense. The harasser now avoids them.
""If I didn't say anything, maybe every time they have an encounter, she might say something rude,"" Lau said. ""Good things come out of it. You just have to speak up or else it kind of enables the bullies.""
After all the assaults on elderly Asians, she is scared for her father and grandmother. But she believes that speaking up can help.
In high school, she was on the bus when a man came up to her and tried to get her attention.
When she ignored him, he said loudly: ""Guess you don't speak English.""
She answered, in English.
""He got embarrassed because he didn't think I was going to respond,"" Lau said. ""That's when I learned that if you don't speak up, people are going to bully you, especially if they think you don't speak English.""

'I would use my voice better next time'
It has been years since high school, but the image is still burned in Sumalee Montano's mind.
She was running for student council president. On election day, someone spray-painted ""nuke the g--"" near the entrance of the school in central Ohio.
The principal called her into his office. The three boys who had painted the racist message were there, too, and apologized to her. They were friends of her opponent.
But that only made the incident scarier.
""I was just like, 'Why am I, a short, small, Asian girl alone in an office with a big, tall, white, male principal and three other big, tall, white guys, all jocks, who basically just threatened me?' All I wanted to do was get out of there as fast as I could,"" she said. ""It was so intimidating and frightening to be alone in that situation.""
The boys were not severely punished, she said. Montano, who is half- Filipino and half-Thai, won the election.
Another time, her family was on a road trip when a group of white men jumped out of a pickup truck carrying bats and big sticks and yelling about ""foreigners.""
Her father looked as if he might fight back, but her mother screamed at him to get in the car and leave. They drove away, with Montano crying in the backseat.
""That was one of the scariest moments of my childhood, to know that these men wanted to kill us just because of the way we looked,"" she said. She was 13 or 14 at the time.
In her Los Angeles neighborhood a few weeks ago, an unmasked woman breathed in Montano's face, then leaned into her 8-year-old son's face and said in a snide tone, ""Oh, aren't you cute?""
Montano didn't say anything. She was too shocked. And she second-guessed her instinct that the woman's behavior was racially motivated.
""I can never prove to anyone that it was racist without her hurling racial slurs at us, but you have to wonder: Would she have done that to us if I was a man? Would she have done that to me if I was white like her?"" said Montano, an actress and voice-over artist.
Her son's assessment was less complicated.
""She did that on purpose, Mamma,"" the boy told her.
Now, she has regrets.
""I promised him it would never happen again and I would use my voice better next time,"" she said.

Uber bans passenger after racist rant against driver is reported at LAX; Incident comes amid a sharp rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans in L.A.,"Wigglesworth, Alex",LA Times,2021-03-14,"It was the sound of a car door slamming that caught Stella Hwang's attention as she waited in the ride-share pickup area of Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday.
""You Asian piece of s--,"" she heard the man yell at his Uber driver, she said. ""You probably don't have papers to even be here.""
The driver, she said, appeared to be in a state of shock. Hwang sprang into action.
""Obviously there was a language barrier with the Uber driver, so I came to his defense,"" she said. ""Because that's what I'm supposed to do as a human being.""
Hwang caught the tail end of the encounter on video, which she posted on Twitter. ""I hope this is not your f-- example because the world doesn't operate like this!"" she can be heard yelling at the passenger, who is wearing a cap advertising a baseball scouting service and carrying a large sports trophy.
""Let me guess,"" he responds. ""You're not married.""
The man then approaches her and jabs his finger in her face, telling her the dispute is none of her business. She addresses two children accompanying him who appear to be his sons, saying, ""Boys, I hope you don't turn out like him.""
""Hey, go get a husband,"" the man retorts before walking away.
""What does me having a husband have to do with anything?"" Hwang said Saturday. ""Does he think a woman needs to be accompanied by a man to speak up for what's right?""
The incident was apparently touched off when the man, whom other media outlets have identified but whose name Uber has not publicly confirmed, attempted to sit in the front seat of the Uber vehicle and became irate when the driver told him to get in the back. Uber confirmed that sitting in the front seat violates policies put in place to limit the spread of the coronavirus and said it has reached out to the driver to offer support.
The man and one of his sons, whose account he's believed to have used to book the ride, have been banned from the Uber app.
""We are shocked and saddened by the recent increase in anti-Asian hate, particularly when it affects a driver or rider,"" Uber said in a statement.
An airport police officer responded to the dispute, Hwang said, but spoke with the man first. She didn't hear their conversation, but she did hear the officer tell the Uber driver to leave, she said.
""When he approached me, he didn't bother asking for my name or if I wanted to file a report,"" she said. The officer told her not to engage with the man and then departed, she said.
The Los Angeles Airport Police Department confirmed an officer was flagged down about 6:30 p.m. for ""two individuals speaking in raised tones"" but said neither person wanted to pursue a citizen's arrest.
""In accordance with the law involving misdemeanor incidents not in the presence of an officer, no further action was required by APD,"" the department said in a statement. ""Both parties continued with their plans separately.""
Most disappointing, Hwang said, was that there were plenty of other people around but she was the only one who came to the driver's aid.
She also noted that the man's social media pages list him as co-founder of an organization that teaches baseball to children. Neither the individual nor the organization, a sports academy in San Diego, returned messages seeking comment Saturday.
""If he feels comfortable displaying this type of behavior in front of his two sons, I can't imagine for him to be around the number of kids that play baseball and are in the program,"" Hwang said. ""Hate is taught. And if somebody with that type of power is in that type of space, we're not moving anywhere.""
The attack comes amid a sharp rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans and other members of the Asian and Pacific Islander communities in Los Angeles, mirroring a national trend.
Police on Tuesday arrested one of several women who they say assaulted a San Francisco Uber driver, tearing off his mask, coughing on him and dousing him with pepper spray. The driver, a Nepali immigrant, has said he believes he was targeted because of his race.
A woman accused of spitting on an Asian American man and yelling an ethnic slur as he dined outdoors in Silicon Valley was charged last week with a misdemeanor hate crime and battery.
In Southern California, a 51-year-old elementary school teacher's aide was beaten with his own cane at a Rosemead bus stop, causing him to lose part of a finger. And in Orange County, neighbors in a Ladera Ranch subdivision have been taking turns watching over an Asian family's home after repeated harassment.
The continued attacks prompted more than 100 people to gather at Irvine City Hall on Saturday for a noontime rally. The event, organized by an ad hoc committee called Stand for Asians Solidarity and featuring speeches by politicians and advocates, was intended to raise awareness and inspire action, said organizer Jerry Raburn.
""I immigrated to this country at 9 years old for the American dream, only to lose that dream because of the structural racism we faced when I was growing up,"" Raburn said. ""I want to end the racism and stop the scapegoating of our community.""
He said that in order to address systemic racism, it's crucial to dismantle the harmful ""model minority"" myth, which he described as ""the stereotypes that Asians are successful, that they don't face racism, that they're good Americans.""
Experts say the recent hate has been fueled in part by misguided notions of blame for the COVID-19 pandemic and at times encouraged by national figures such as former President Trump, who insisted on using terms like ""China virus.""
Before she started filming her encounter with the man at the airport, Hwang said, he made his political views clear. ""He said, 'You probably voted for Biden,' which I felt as though had nothing to do with anything,"" she said.
""So my response was, you obviously voted for Trump. His response was, 'You're damn right.' """,5864
Victims' identities emerge in spa attacks; Family and friends mourn those killed and hurt in this week's Georgia shootings.,"Jarvie, Jenny; Etehad, Melissa; Read, Richard",LA Times,2021-03-20,"Correction: Shooting victims: In the March 20 Section A, an article about the identities of the victims of the Atlanta-area spa shootings incorrectly rendered three names. The correct names are Soon Chung Park, Hyun Jung Grant and Yong Ae Yue.
With the identities of all victims of Tuesday's shootings at three Atlanta-area spas now public, details remained scant Friday on several of the eight who were killed by a gunman.
The victims included six women of Asian descent and a woman and man who were white. Four of the women were shot down at two Atlanta spas. The Fulton County Medical Examiner's office said Friday that Soon C. Park, 74, Yong A. Yue, 63, and Hyun J. Grant, 51, died of gunshot wounds to the head. Suncha Kim, 69, had fatal wounds to the chest.
Three other women and a man who died at a spa in the northwest suburb of Acworth had been identified previously. The victims included workers at the spas, a handyman and a customer. A man who was standing in the parking lot of the suburban spa when he was shot survived and was hospitalized.
Robert Aaron Long, 21, who is white, is charged with murder in the killings at Gold Spa and Aromatherapy Spa in Atlanta and Young's Asian Massage in Acworth, 25 miles away.
Here is what is known so far about the nine victims, including the survivor:
--
Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33
Yaun was a Waffle House server and grill operator who came into work every morning singing and blasting gospel music from her cellphone.
""She was a beautiful person, 100% caring,"" John Beck, 27, her friend and former Waffle House manager, told The Times. ""The kind of person would give the shirt off her back to anyone.""
He said that when Yaun started working at the Waffle House three years ago, she let homeless people inside the restaurant, paid for their meals and sometimes brought them back to her home to let them bathe and give them clothes.
Yaun raised her 13-year-old son as a single mother and had long wanted another child, Beck said. But she struggled to find the right man -- until last year, when she met Mario Gonzalez. Eight months ago, she gave birth to their daughter.
""She ended up having a baby, got married,"" Beck said. ""She was truly happy, and she was the type of person that deserved happiness.""
Friends said that Yaun and Gonzalez were excited to go to Young's Asian Massage in Acworth, just a few blocks from the Waffle House, on Tuesday evening to unwind. Yaun was shot to death; Gonzalez was spared.
""Mario is completely devastated,"" Cristy Lynn McGouirk, who identified herself as Yaun's cousin, posted on Facebook. ""They were on a date night, and just wanted to relax. In a blink of an eye, she was taken from him.""
""She had real good heart to her,"" Dustin Norman, 33, a friend and neighbor from Acworth, said as he stood outside the spa Thursday with a bouquet of yellow, lavender and white daisies. ""She did not deserve to go like this.""

Paul Andre Michels, 54
A businessman and U.S. Army veteran, Michels had been working at Young's as a handyman.
""He was a good, kind, loving guy,"" his brother John Michels, 52, told The Times.
The brothers grew up outside Detroit in a family of nine children. John said Paul served in the Army and owned businesses in home security and theater before moving to Georgia about 25 years ago.
A hardworking Catholic who was politically conservative, Michels had been married for two decades, his brother said.
In an interview with Atlanta news station CBS46, a family friend, Kikiana Whidby, said Michels was unemployed and was doing handiwork for the spa to make ends meet.
Whidby, who said Michels and his wife were godparents to her son, said he had built a shelf for the spa on Tuesday.
""He had been out of work for a while, and this was something that came to him and he was really excited about,"" she told the station. ""I'm mad. It couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.""

Xiaojie 'Emily' Tan, 49
Xiaojie Tan, who went by Emily, was a mother, small-business owner and cosmetologist who lived in the town of Kennesaw, , and had an adult daughter who recently graduated from the University of Georgia.
An immigrant from China who visited her family there each New Year, Tan was the owner of Young's, which is in Cherokee County.
Public records show she held several licenses in cosmetology as well as massage therapy in Florida and Georgia.
""She was the hardest-working person. She was always working,"" said a close friend who came to the spa Thursday. ""It's so sad. Today is her birthday. She was supposed to turn 50 today.""

Daoyou Feng, 44
Besides her name and age, no information has been released about Feng, who was killed at Young's.

Elcias R. Hernandez-Ortiz, 30
A mechanic from Guatemala, Hernandez-Ortiz was standing in a parking lot near Young's when he was shot, according to family members who spoke to local television stations in Georgia.
""Please pray for my family and the families that were affected by this shooting,"" his wife, Flora Gonzalez Gomez, wrote on a GoFundMe page.
She said her husband -- the only shooting victim who survived -- was hospitalized in intensive care.
""He was shot in the forehead down to his lungs and stomach,"" Gomez said. ""He will be needing facial surgery.""

Soon C. Park, 74
The eldest of the victims, who went by Julie, is known only to have come from New York, Korea Times Atlanta reported.

Suncha Kim, 69
A New Jersey native, Kim moved to Atlanta 15 years ago, the Korean-language newspaper reported. She has children in New York, where her funeral will be held, the paper said.
Connie Jee, co-founder and executive director of the Asian American Resource Center in Atlanta, said Suncha's daughter told her that Suncha lived at Gold Spa and helped with meals and laundry for employees.

Yong Yue, 63
Yue, a licensed massage therapist, lived in Duluth, Ga. She was shot when she opened the door of Aromatherapy Spa, thinking that Long was a customer, the Korea Times reported.

Hyun Jung Grant, 51
Grant was a single mother from South Korea who dedicated her life to providing for her family, her son Randy Park said.
Hyun-ji, as she was affectionately called, was ""a beautiful, vibrant person who loved life, who loved her kids,"" her cousin, Shannon Pugh, of Beaverton, Ore., said in an interview Friday, the day she learned of her death.
""I'm just mad, I'm angry, I'm hurt,"" she said, reflecting on the victims. ""I hope they get justice. I hope this man is put away.""
Park wrote on a GoFundMe fundraising account that he and his brother, Eric, were the only family members in the United States, adding that the rest of their family was in South Korea.
""She was one of my best friends and the strongest influence on who we are today,"" Park, 23, wrote about his mother. ""Losing her has put a new lens on my eyes on the amount of hate that exists in our world.""
Park said he has had little time to grieve. Without his mother's income at the spa, he worried that he and his brother could not afford to live in their current home in Duluth, a booming suburb about 30 miles northeast of Atlanta that has a rapidly growing Asian population.
""My biggest priority right now is to put my mother to rest and plan out the funeral, but due to some legal complications, I am unable to obtain my mother's body,"" he wrote as he appealed for money for rent, food and monthly bills. ""I wish to stay in my current home for at least one more month to sort everything out.""
Park set a $20,000 goal for his fundraising campaign. Within 20 hours, donors gave more than $1.8 million.
Many of the 42,000 people who contributed gave small contributions. One person gave $5,000.
""Randy, take care of yourself and your brother,"" a donor named Somsany Phakonekham wrote in the comments. ""Do not let the hate of other individuals divide you from the rest of the world.""
In thanks, Park wrote, ""I will live the rest of my days grateful for what has essentially given my family a second chance.""",7937
CITY & STATE; LAPD recorded 15 hate crimes against Asian Americans last year; The total was more than double that of 2019. Most occurred in the department's West and Central bureaus.,"Miller, Leila",LA Times,2021-04-18,"The Los Angeles Police Department documented 15 hate crimes against Asian Americans in 2020, more than double the previous year, according to a new study by the 
agency. 
The findings were included in a report submitted to the Police Commission last week that analyzed hate crimes and hate incidents against the Asian American and Pacific Islander community in L.A. last year. Seven hate crimes were reported against Asian Americans in 2019 and nine the previous year. 
The 15 hate crimes against Asian Americans last year accounted for 4.2% of 355 total hate crimes reported in 2020 and 8.1% of all hate crimes related to race, according to the report. 
Of the hate crimes reported, nine were classified as battery, five as criminal threats or aggravated assault and one as a bomb threat made in an email to the Japanese American National Museum, according to the LAPD report. 
Suspects have not been identified in nine cases. The city attorney's office declined to file charges in two cases due to insufficient evidence and is currently reviewing one 
case. 
The L.A. County district attorney's office also declined to file hate crime enhancements against a suspect facing other charges. And in two incidents, the victims, or in the case of a minor, their parents, declined to file charges. 
Officials also documented nine hate incidents, or reports of actual or perceived bias that don't rise to the level of crimes, against Asian Americans. Those accounted for 4.5% of 199 total hate incidents reported last year and 8% of all hate incidents related to race. 
Anti-Asian harassment and violence have surged across the state and country since the beginning of the pandemic, with attacks often tied to the misconception that Asian Americans are to blame for the spread of the coronavirus. The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China. 
In their analysis, officials noted ""increasing hostility towards the Chinese community."" In six of the 24 hate crimes and incidents, the offenders mentioned the coronavirus. Seven other cases included anti-Chinese rhetoric. 
Most hate crimes and incidents against Asians occurred in the LAPD's West and Central bureaus. More than half took place on the street, sidewalk or outdoor parking lots. Several occurred in a store or market. 
In one documented hate crime from March 2020, a woman was standing at a crosswalk in Mid-City when four people approached and said: ""You coronavirus people. Look at these coronavirus."" One of the group then spat on her face, the LAPD said. 
In another reported hate crime from April 2020, a man was jogging in Mid-Wilshire when someone pulled up next to him in a car and told him to put on his mask. 
The jogger called him a moron, and the man yelled an expletive, saying: ""Your people brought the coronavirus. Go back to your country!"" He threw a glass bottle but missed the jogger. 
Males and females were almost evenly targeted in the hate crimes and incidents, according to the report. The reported races of the offenders included white, Black and Latino people. ",3042
"Anti-Asian hate crimes 'just the tip of the iceberg'; After several more attacks are reported, communities fear the hostility will persist.","Smith, Hayley",LA Times,2021-04-16,"A recent rash of anti-Asian hate crimes in California is continuing, with more verbal and physical assaults reported in the last week. 
An Asian American woman was spat on and called racist slurs in her own garage. Another woman was punched and bombarded with racial comments in a park. 
On a bus in Eagle Rock, an attacker apparently mistook an elderly Latina woman for Asian, calling her an anti-Chinese slur before reportedly pulling her hair and breaking her nose. 
Seemingly bothered by the drumbeat of hate, a Korean man in Orange County allegedly kidnapped a woman he thought was white but who turned out to be Asian. 
Experts said an increase in anti-Asian attacks began in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic intensified, with the attacks spiking sharply in recent months. 
Some attackers have seized on the virus' Chinese origins to erroneously blame Asian Americans for the pandemic. 
Law enforcement officials have said a shooting rampage at spas in the Atlanta area that left eight people dead, including six Asian women, did not appear to be motivated by racial bias. But for many Asian Americans, the massacre last month by a 21-year-old white man was the culmination of a year of anti-Asian hatred. 
""This has been with us for at least a solid year and likely to be much longer,"" said Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate. 
From March 2020 to February, nearly 3,800 attacks against Asian Americans nationwide were reported to Stop AAPI Hate. A report by the group that will be released within weeks shows a ""significant increase"" in anti-Asian attacks in the last year, Kulkarni said. 
""Really, that's just the tip of the iceberg through February,"" she said. 
Initially, many of the attacks that gained widespread media attention were violent assaults against elderly Asian pedestrians for which authorities did not determine a motive because the attacker did not say anything racist. 
Other attacks have included racial slurs, sometimes accompanied by physical assaults. 
On Tuesday, a man followed an Asian woman into her garage, shouted racial insults and spat in her face, El Cerrito Police Lt. Lauren Caputo said. 
The man, Ricky Amos, 56, was described as homeless and did not know the victim, Caputo said. 
Amos was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of battery and vandalism with a hate crime enhancement. He also faces charges of violating sex offender registration requirements. 
In Tustin on Sunday morning, an 18-year-old Korean American woman was preparing to teach a private art lesson in Veterans Sports Park when a man approached her and made comments about her appearance, according to the Orange County Register. 
""When I said I'm Korean, it was like he got excited,"" the woman, Jenna Dupuy, told the Register. 
About an hour later, the man returned and grew increasingly threatening, with several parkgoers asking him to leave. 
""The suspect made racial comments and punched her in the stomach,"" Lt. Stephanie Nichols of the Tustin Police Department said in a statement. 
Dupuy pepper-sprayed the man, and he fled the scene before officers arrived. 
Jauhar Tajuddin Shuaib, 42, of Irvine was arrested on suspicion of a hate crime, assault, sexually motivated annoyance, abusive language and other offenses, Nichols said. 
Dupuy said she suffered a concussion and fractured shoulder, among other injuries. 
Calling it a ""horrific incident,"" Tustin Mayor Letitia Clark said the city will not tolerate bigotry or racism. 
""I am profoundly disturbed by both the rise in hate crimes directed at our Asian American and Pacific Islander neighbors across the county and the recent incident in Veterans Sports Park,"" Clark said in a statement. ""As a community, we cannot be silent about these crimes."" 
The city is creating a hotline for reporting hate crimes, she said, and will be offering a self-defense class in the near future. 
In Eagle Rock, a 70-year-old Mexican American woman was reportedly attacked Friday while trying to get off a Metro bus. Witnesses said the attacker used an anti- Chinese slur against the woman before assaulting her. 
The woman's nose was broken and her hair was pulled, her son told the Eastsider, adding that his family members are often mistaken for Asian. 
Yasmine Beasley, 23, was arrested on suspicion of felony battery, said Officer William Cooper, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman. Cooper said he did not know whether prosecutors were pursuing hate crime charges. 
In a statement about the incident, Metro expressed condolences to victims of hate crimes on the transit system and said it has a zero-tolerance policy for violence against customers or employees. 
""We strongly condemn any offenses done in the name of race, religion, sex or national origin,"" the agency said. 
Experts say the rise in hate crimes is linked to anti-Asian rhetoric arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, then-President Trump called the coronavirus ""the Chinese virus"" and ""kung flu."" 
""Trump's role in exacerbating and igniting this firestorm can't be denied,"" said Karen Umemoto, director of the Asian American Studies Center at UCLA, noting that a recent study found a significant increase in anti-Asian hashtags in the week after Trump tweeted about ""the Chinese virus."" 
Stop AAPI Hate and other organizations are pushing for improvements in education, data collection and legislation, including a civil rights infrastructure that would allow people to report hate incidents and have more access to victims' resources. 
In what police described as an attempt to retaliate for hate crimes against Asians, a man in Lake Forest kidnapped a woman, held her at gunpoint in her car and groped her. 
When the victim yelled to a nearby maintenance worker for help, the man, identified by police as 37-year-old Michael Sangbong Rhee, ran through an apartment complex before fleeing in his own vehicle. 
Surveillance cameras captured his license plate as he sped away, police said. 
Rhee, who is of Korean descent, was arrested April 8 on suspicion of kidnapping with the intent to commit a sexual assault. 
Hate crime charges were later added to the complaint, said Sgt. Karie Davies of the Irvine Police Department. 
The woman was not white, as authorities say Rhee had thought, but Asian, Davies said.

'I will not be quiet': Teens speak out against anti-Asian attacks,Emily Alpert Reyes,LA Times,2021-05-09,"Jenna Dupuy said she was shocked when it happened, even amid the outpouring of news about such attacks: a man spewing hateful slurs against Asians and assaulting her, fracturing her shoulder and ankle and dealing her a concussion. 
Dupuy, who uses both ""she"" and ""they"" pronouns, said that before the attack, the man had harassed them for hours with sexual comments about being Asian -- and no one had interrupted his threats and abuse until he physically hurt them. 
""This happened because I am an Asian woman,"" the 18-year-old Puerto Rican and Korean American told a crowd at Grand Park in downtown Los Angeles. The attack at a skate park was rooted in ""the xenophobia and racism that comes from the decades of 'yellow peril' stereotypes but also because of the fetishization"" of Asian women. 
""But I am an Asian woman, and I will not be quiet, and I will not be submissive, and I will not be subservient,"" Dupuy told the cheering crowd, a black boot visible on their right ankle. ""And you are going to listen to me."" 
Scores of people turned out Saturday to spread awareness of such attacks, build solidarity among people of color and bring solace and joy to one another. The ""Youth Against Hate"" event was organized by youth organizations including the ACLU SoCal's Youth Liberty Squad and 626 Speak Out, as well as the ACLU of Souther California, Make Noise Today and the USC Pacific Asia Museum. Organizers described it as ""a youth-led space of solidarity and healing."" 
""It pains me to have to open my phone to see another Asian hate crime every single day,"" said Hilary Wong, a 17-year-old who spoke at the event. ""I worry every day for my family and all my fellow Asians out there."" 
Hate crimes against Asian Americans had increased as of earlier this year in Los Angeles, according to a recent report by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino. Its analysis found an 80% increase in anti-Asian hate crimes reported to police in L.A. during the first three months of 2021 compared with the same period last year. 
Stop AAPI Hate, a national coalition focused on discrimination and attacks on Asians amid the COVID-19 pandemic, documented more than 3,700 such incidents that were reported to the group in a little less than a year -- likely a fraction of the attacks that occurred, it said. Asian Americans recounted being verbally harassed, shunned, spat on and assaulted. 
In the Orange County community of Ladera Ranch, one family was harassed for months by teenagers pounding on their door, throwing rocks and shouting abuse until neighbors set up a nightly watch. In the L.A. neighborhood of Eagle Rock, an attacker beat an elderly woman on the bus. She was Latina, but her assailant reportedly used an anti-Chinese slur. 
""We are standing up for our elders because we don't want that to happen in the future,"" said Millie Liao, 16, a lead organizer for the event in Grand Park. ""We have the responsibility to protect the people that have raised us and created a space in America for us."" 
Many attacks that have drawn public attention have targeted Asian American seniors, but children, teens and young adults have also reported being mistreated and assaulted. Experts have linked the growing abuse and discrimination to stigmatizing terms about the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. 
Asian Americans ""have been dehumanized and scapegoated throughout this entire pandemic,"" said Alina Wong, 16, co-founder of 626 Speak Out. Racist abuse is not new to the Asian community, but when ""the leader of the nation pointed his finger at us by using verbiage like 'China virus,' 'kung flu' or 'Wuhan virus,' the targets on our backs only grew larger."" 
Millie said discrimination ""has been here since we've been here,"" citing historic examples such as the Chinese Exclusion Act, which initially banned Chinese immigration while barring those already here from becoming citizens, and the wartime imprisonment of Japanese Americans. 
During Saturday's event, Asian American teens also shared everyday instances of mistreatment: kids pulling on the corners of their eyes at school. Racist mockery on television and in movies. Being told to go back where they came from. 
Hilary recounted one instance in which she stood up for herself: ""This time I said something. I told him I was born here, in San Gabriel, California."" The crowd erupted in cheers. ""I belong here! Just like all of you belong here!"" 
The teens' passion and energy amazed Zig Jiang, the president of the Chinese American Equalization Assn. 
""Kids 14 and 17? To come here and stand up, to fight against Asian hate?"" he told the crowd, calling for a round of applause. 
""This is our future,"" he said. ""Those are our leaders."" ",4741
Study confirms surge in attacks; Hate crimes against Asian Americans rose 164% in first quarter; L.A. saw 80% increase.,"Smith, Hayley",LA Times,2021-05-05,"Denny Kim was walking to dinner in Koreatown in February when he was attacked. 
Two men approached Kim, a 27-year-old Air Force veteran, and shouted anti-Asian slurs, including ""Chinese virus,"" before taking a swing at him. He was left with a black eye and an injured nose. 
It was ""absolutely unprovoked,"" Kim, who is Asian American, told KTLA-TV at the time. ""I didn't know who these guys are."" 
He had become one of a growing number of victims of anti-Asian hate crimes, which continue to surge in Los Angeles and around the country, a new study has found. The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino examined police data from 16 jurisdictions across the country, finding a 164% increase in reports of anti-Asian hate crimes in the first quarter of 2021 compared with the same period last year. 
New York saw the greatest increase, at 223%, followed by 140% in San Francisco, 80% in Los Angeles and 60% in Boston. Some cities, including Phoenix, Seattle and Miami, reported no change. 
The study's author, Brian Levin, said the jurisdictions were chosen because they have large Asian American populations and a history of collecting reliable data on hate 
crimes. 
""There's a national story, and there's also local and regional stories, but it's fairly consistent,"" said Levin, the center's director and a professor of criminal justice. ""The nature of these crimes are violent."" 
In Los Angeles, there were nine documented anti-Asian hate crimes in the first quarter of this year, while in San Francisco, there were 12. Both cities had five in the same period last year. 
Heightened awareness often drives increased reporting, but Levin said the study's findings point to a legitimate jump in violence. 
""Some of this increase that we've seen is going to be due to what we call 'reporting effect,' certainly, but not at this level,"" he said. ""You have all these jigsaw puzzle pieces you put together, but it points to a horrifying surge in violence against our Asian American community, which is being sustained."" 
Some experts have noted that such attacks are probably underreported because of language barriers or technological issues. 
Hate crimes are defined as criminal acts motivated by characteristics such as race, religion or sexual orientation. Hate incidents do not rise to the level of criminality but include acts like bullying, name calling and verbal abuse. 
A California-based advocacy organization for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, Stop AAPI Hate, said it received nearly 3,800 reports of attacks nationwide between March 19, 2020, and February 28, 2021. About 68% were verbal harassment, 21% were shunning (deliberate avoidance), and 11% were physical assaults. 
According to Levin's report, the first-quarter increase follows a historic surge that began in March last year amid a rise in both COVID-19 cases and the ""political and online stigmatizing of Asians."" In 2020, anti-Asian hate crimes increased 146% across 26 of the country's largest jurisdictions, the report says. 
This year, attacks in the U.S. have included spitting, rock throwing and harassment. Many Asian Americans believe the Atlanta-area shootings in March that left eight people dead, including six Asian women, were hate crimes, though law enforcement officials have said racial bias did not appear to be a motive. 
Experts point to a number of factors behind the surge, including the use during the pandemic of stigmatizing language such as ""Kung flu"" and ""China virus."" 
In March 2020, then-President Trump tweeted the phrase ""China virus"" more than 20 times, the report says. Spikes in Google keyword searches for the phrase appeared as recently as this January, according to the report -- the same month Trump used it in a tweet decrying as ""fake news"" the COVID-19 case and death counts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Dorinne Kondo, professor of American studies and ethnicity at USC, said the uptick in attacks is not surprising. 
--- 
""There's no doubt that Trump legitimized the public expression of what some people may have secretly felt but it builds on histories that have been here since inception,"" Kondo said. 
Anti-Asian sentiment is woven into much of American history, Kondo said, from the California Alien Land Law of 1913, which made land ownership ille- gal for immigrants, to Japanese American internment camps during World War II. 
New laws and leadership may help, Kondo added, but the problems won't disappear overnight. 
""The thing about hate crime is it's not irrational hate,"" she said. ""It's the absolutely predictable outcome of structural inequality, so these incidents will continue as long as there are structural inequalities."" 
In California, several of the recent incidents have been violent and sustained. 
In one, an Asian American woman in El Cerrito was spat upon and called racist slurs while in her own garage. In another, a Ladera Ranch family was repeatedly harassed with rocks, verbal attacks and pounding at the door over the course of several months. 
In yet another Los Angeles incident, an attacker in Eagle Rock apparently mistook an elderly Latina woman for Asian, calling her an anti-Chinese slur before reportedly pulling her hair and breaking her nose. 
In California, where 15% of residents are Asian or Pacific Islander, several areas have taken steps to address the increase in attacks. The Orange County Board of Supervisors in March unanimously passed two resolutions denouncing hate crimes and committing to taking action. Huntington Beach took a similar step in April. 
The Los Angeles Human Relations Commission in 2019 launched the L.A. vs. Hate campaign to address issues in the county. Campaign leader Terri Villa-McDowell said Tuesday that victims can report hate crimes and hate incidents without going though law enforcement by dialing 211 or filling out a form online. Reports can be made anonymously and are accessible in 140 languages. 
The state is considering legislation that would establish a Commission on the State of Hate, which would provide more resources to various agencies and the public, require a minimum of four community forums each year and require comprehensive accounting of hate crimes statewide, among other goals. 
California Assemblyman Richard Bloom, who authored the legislation, Assembly Bill 1126, said he was driven by ""frustration with increased hate locally and around the world."" 
""We can't eradicate hate, but we can name it and aim to understand how and why feelings of dislike snowball into full-blown hateful conduct and hate crimes,"" Bloom said in an email. 
If the bill becomes law, the commission will be the first of its kind in the nation, he said. 
Levin noted that if the study's first-quarter findings are any indication for the rest of the year, there is much work to be done. 
""This is one quarter of one year with only 16 jurisdictions,"" he said. ""It's horrifying.""

"ASIANS FACING HATE ON MANY FRONTS; A new report tallies incidents in schools, restaurants, Zoom meetings and more. ","Do, Anh ",LA Times,2021-05-07,"At a store in Alhambra, a worker refused to ring up Asian American customers, hurling a racial insult at one. 
At a school in Texas, students picked on Asian American classmates, saying they had the coronavirus and everyone should stay away from them. 
In Muskegon, Mich., a customer spat on an Asian American worker and said, ""Go home and take the COVID with you."" 
A report from Stop AAPI Hate released Thursday shows the breadth of anti-Asian racism during the COVID-19 pandemic. Racist attacks, some verbal and some physical, were reported in cities like Alhambra and New York with large Asian populations and Muskegon with few Asian residents. 
The attacks took place in schools, restaurants, stores, subways, sidewalks, fitness classes and Zoom meetings. Some involved allegations about the coronavirus, while other perpetrators used age-old racial slurs like ""ching chong."" 
Some victims were elderly, others children. Some were coughed on or spat on, some slapped or hit, some refused service at businesses, still others stung by racist words or by people declining to interact with them. 
The incidents were reported to Stop AAPI Hate, a group formed in March 2020 in response to attacks related to the perception that Asians were responsible for the coronavirus because of its origins in Wuhan, China. 
The new study builds on a previous one released two months ago. 
In March, people around the country reported more than 2,800 anti-Asian hate incidents to Stop AAPI Hate. In the entire year before that, the group received about 3,800 reports of racial incidents. 
The sudden surge could be due in part to greater awareness that Stop AAPI Hate, founded by a coalition of Asian American advocacy groups, is collecting reports about racist incidents. But law enforcement agencies around the country are also seeing a large increase in reported anti-Asian hate crimes. 
New York saw the greatest increase, at 223%, followed by 140% in San Francisco and 80% in Los Angeles, in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period last year, according to a report by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino. 
Hate crimes are attacks on people or property motivated by race, gender or other protected characteristics. Hate incidents involve name calling or insults but do not rise to the level of a crime. 
The Stop AAPI Hate study includes both types of situations. Nearly two-thirds of the more than 6,600 anti-Asian incidents reported from last March to this March involved verbal harassment. About 18% involved shunning -- people deliberately avoiding Asian Americans and 13% were physical assaults. 
Civil rights violations such as workplace discrimination and being refused service at a business were 10%. Online harassment was 7%. 
On its website, the group accepts reports in 10 Asian languages, including Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean and Tagalog, in addition to English. 
""Racism against Asian Americans is systemic and long-standing,"" said Russell Jeung, cofounder of Stop AAPI Hate and professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University. 
""The more we draw attention to anti-Asian hate, the more Asian Americans know they have a place to report what they're experiencing, and the more we can demonstrate the extent of the problem and advocate for meaningful solutions."" 
In some instances, attackers say nothing explicitly racist, but victims feel targeted because of their race. 
Shelley Nguyen, 48, reported a series of incidents to Stop AAPI Hate last summer. 
A white woman repeatedly accosted her at a San Francisco park, demanding that she cover her face while jogging, then erupting into curses and insults, said Nguyen, a physician who is Vietnamese American. 
One time, the woman removed her neck gaiter and coughed on Nguyen, her husband and daughter, telling the child: ""Geez, kid, I'm sorry your mom is such a b--."" 
Jasmine Li, a Chinese American from Aliso Viejo, said her 10-year-old daughter was waiting for a ride home from school in October when four or five boys asked: ""Why are you here? Are you sick? Do you have COVID?"" 
Later, a larger group of students, including the ones who had taunted her earlier, started chanting ""Corona, Corona, Corona,"" when the child walked past them on her way to the school's front office. 
Li, an information technology specialist, said she and her husband had heard about racist incidents throughout the pandemic and were worried their daughter would face further attacks. 
She immediately reported what happened to the principal. 
""This is not right,"" she said. ""Children should not be picked on, and thank goodness my daughter is too young to be able to tell what type of things are racially motivated, but we still need to protect her.""

CITY & STATE; Dead cat left at shop is investigated as possible hate crime; Incident took place at Sacramento butcher shop owned by family of Chinese descent.,"Lu, Jennifer",LA Times,2021-02-27,"An incident involving a man leaving a box containing a mutilated cat carcass outside an Asian family-run butcher shop in Sacramento is being investigated as a possible hate crime, authorities said.
Caught on video surveillance tape, the incident occurred Monday evening outside Mad Butcher Meat Co., whose owners are of Chinese descent, according to the Sacramento Police Department, which is investigating the incident as a possible bias or hate-related crime.
""Not only was an animal violently abused, but it was used to threaten and provoke fear at an Asian American-owned business in Sacramento,"" Councilwoman Mai Vang said. ""Our city has committed to racial equity and justice -- which means confronting the perpetrators of hate and acknowledging the trauma and suffering experienced by victims.""
The owners of Mad Butcher Meat Co. posted on the shop's social media page that they were ""shaken and especially disappointed"" by the incident.
""It is impossible for us to fully discuss this incident without feeling an overwhelming amount of emotion,"" they said.
The shop -- owned by Michael and Diana Shum's family for more than 30 years -- thanked the community for the ""calls, hugs, support, and community organizing"" in a social media post Wednesday. ""We are very blessed to have you guys as our family.""
The incident comes amid a string of attacks on Asians and Asian Americans, many of them against people who are elderly or otherwise vulnerable.

Asian-Americans face new pretext for hatred,"Rao, Maya",Star Tribune,2021-03-28,"Alvin Moua returned from work to his Woodbury townhouse this week to find an anonymous letter taped to the door:
""We're watching you [expletives]. take the chinese virus back to china. We don't want you ... infecting us with your
diseases!!!!!!!!!!""
The note was signed, ""your friendly neighbors.""
""My blood was boiling,"" recalled Moua, a 28-year-old account manager at a staffing agency who is a native-born
American of Hmong descent.
Some Asian-Americans in the Twin Cities and across the nation are facing hostility as the U.S. becomes the country with
the largest number of cases of COVID-19, caused by a virus that President Donald Trump controversially dubbed the
""Chinese flu.""
In New York, an Asian-American woman was punched in the face by a woman who denounced her heritage and
demanded to know where her face mask was. In California, a 16-year-old Asian-American boy was attacked by
classmates who accused him of carrying the virus.
In Minnesota, people of East Asian descent more commonly report getting rude looks or comments from other patrons in
stores, community leaders say.
The Minnesota Department of Human Rights says it has started to hear about bias incidents targeting Asian-Americans.
And state agencies, such as the Department of Health, are reminding people not to make assumptions about who has
the disease based on their ethnic background.
Public health experts have discouraged attaching a nationality to the virus and raised concerns that Trump's word choice
could increase xenophobic attacks, though Trump has said that he's being accurate, not racist. The president clarified
this week that it was important to ""protect our Asian-American community"" and that the spread of COVID-19 is not their
fault.
As an investigator in the Attorney General's Office, Thai Heu has been tracking bias complaints from the Asian-American
community and visited Moua's home Thursday to interview him. He also interviewed a Hmong apartment manager in
Woodbury who found a handwritten note in a box where rent payments are dropped off that read, ""Go back to your
country or I kill you, Chinese!""
Heu said he knows many Hmong people who have been getting ammunition and weapons to protect themselves and
their families.
The tension hit home recently for Mysee Chang, a 28-year-old resident of St. Paul, when she got a phone call from her
Hmong step-grandmother who said through tears, ""I don't feel safe, what do I do?""
As shoppers clamored to get groceries to ride out the pandemic, Chang said, a man confronted her step-grandmother for
taking one of the last packages of chicken. Chang said the man apparently thought her grandmother was Chinese and
said, ""You are the reason why this is happening, so you don't deserve this meat.""
A cousin who lives in the Woodbury apartment complex where the death threat was sent said she fears someone will be
watching when she goes out.
Chang said she has been working to relay precautions about social distancing to Hmong elders and has encouraged
relatives to postpone two traditional funerals that would have brought out hundreds of people. But while she feels she
knows how to handle the public health aspect of the pandemic, she's unsure how to protect her family against racism.
""I no longer feel safe,"" she said.
State Rep. Jay Xiong, DFL-St. Paul, said in a Facebook post that he rolled down his car window in a store parking lot
recently and realized that a man was yelling racist comments at him.
""Among the obscenities he hurled included calling me a [racial slur] and telling me that a disease-ridden person like
myself should go back to my country,"" Xiong said.
""I am both saddened and outraged that as a Hmong-American born and raised in St. Paul, I had to hear such racist
nonsense,"" he wrote. ""I have heard similar stories out in [the] community, and there have been worse manifestations of
such incidents, which include violence.""
Xiong did not respond to requests for an interview.
""It's these types of things that we're hearing about,"" said Taylor Putz, a spokesman for the Minnesota Department of
Human Rights. Putz noted, however, that the agency's authority extends only to discrimination in housing, employment
and education.
""So if your neighbor calls and yells at you and says, 'Go back to your country with your virus because you're Asian,'
although that's not a friendly thing to do at all, that's not [what] falls under the Minnesota Human Rights Act,"" he said.
In Woodbury, Moua's landlord reported the racist note to the police.
""Ninety-nine percent of the community is great -- I haven't had an issue,"" Moua said. ""It's always just that one person
that ruins it.""
Members of the Coalition of Asian American Leaders network have reported recent bias incidents related to the virus,
such as cashiers refusing to serve them, according to executive director Bo Thao-Urabe. The coalition is holding a
webinar April 10 to talk about dealing with xenophobia and discrimination during the pandemic. Featured speakers
include Asian-American historian Erika Lee and Minnesota Department of Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero.
Thao-Urabe said she's heard complaints, mainly from people of East Asian descent -- like the Hmong -- who are not
even Chinese-American. Minnesota's sizable Hmong population began arriving as refugees from Laos in the 1970s.
""If a person is choosing to be racist, they're not thinking about asking if you're Chinese or if you're a different ethnicity,""
she said.
Zhuoling Ren, founder and president of the China Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said her patients have been
understanding and that the virus has not affected her St. Paul clinic or the way she's been treated as an individual. By
and large, Ren considers Minnesotans loving people.
""We're tied with the whole community -- we are not just Asian and Chinese, we're also American residents and citizens
as well,"" Ren said.
Ren said Trump's comment warning against blaming Asian-Americans for the virus ""helps a little bit.""
""Those people who are trying to put hatred and complaints and frustrations toward Asian-Americans and ChineseAmericans, I think that's not fair,"" she said. ""It's really ridiculous.""",6181
Support and protect Asian Americans,None,Star Tribune,2021-03-21,"During the past year, a Woodbury resident of Hmong descent and his wife found a note on their townhouse door
accusing them of ""infecting us with your disease.""
In Austin, Minn., an Asian American family discovered the words ""China virus"" burned into their lawn. And a Korean
American journalist with MPR News described being harassed because of her race while working in rural
Minnesota.
In addition, increasing numbers of Asian Americans have been physically assaulted nationwide over the past year.
Anti-Asian hate is one of several forms of American racism that must be acknowledged and stopped.
The deadly March 16 shootings in Atlanta have heightened awareness of anti-Asian incidents, sparking solidarity
protests over the weekend. Although the shooter's motivations remain unclear as the investigation continues, six
of his eight victims were women of Asian descent.
Organizations that work on behalf Minnesota's 300,000 people of Asian descent say they've experienced
discrimination and racism for decades. ""Racism is not a one-time incident,"" Bo Thao-Urabe, executive director of
the Coalition of Asian American Leaders (CAAL), a St. Paul nonprofit, told the Star Tribune. She added that CAAL
and other groups have been concerned that attacks on Asian Americans would increase and become more violent.
Fearing that the coronavirus outbreak would lead to a backlash, early last year the World Health Organization
warned about the use of terms such as ""Wuhan virus"" and ""Chinese virus."" Former President Donald Trump
seemed to take pleasure in disregarding that advice, and his use of those labels and others in tweets and public
comments sparked the response that the WHO had predicted.
The ramped-up hostility has been well documented. According to PoltiFact, the respected Center for the Study of
Hate and Extremism at California State University found that anti-Asian hate crimes rose from 49 incidents in 2019
to 122 in 2020.
The center used public records from 16 of the largest U.S. cities to come up with those numbers. And the FBI's
hate crime data shows that reported anti-Asian hate crimes declined in the late 1990s but started to climb more
recently.
It's important to note that experts say hate crimes are underreported. ""There are barriers to reporting,"" Jeannine
Bell, an Indiana University law professor, told PolitiFact. ""Individual victims have to feel as if they are comfortable
enough to report, and most likely they don't.""
Last week, state Rep. Tou Xiong, DFL-Maplewood, who chairs the Minnesota Asian Pacific Caucus, addressed the
Legsislature and rightly urged Minnesotans to denounce racism. ""Silence amid this growing surge [in hate] against
fellow Asian Americans is unacceptable,"" Xiong said.
President Joe Biden has directed the Justice Department to work with communities to address hate crimes
against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. And in Minnesota, officials launched a discrimination helpline (1-
833-454-0148) after bias reports against Asian Americans grew during the pandemic.
On Wednesday, CAAL will host an online event to raise awareness and share strategies to combat harassment and
crime. It's a critical effort that all Minnesotans should support.",3206
"Anti-Asian attacks spur call for change: DFL-backed bills seek better hate-crime reporting, police training. ","Montemayor, Stephen ",Star Tribune,2021-04-01,"A troubling rise in anti-Asian incidents reported to Minnesota community groups started a month before COVID-19 appeared in the state last year. 
As the pandemic worsened, so did reports to groups like the St. Paul-based Coalition of Asian American Leaders. In one call to the group, a couple said an angry fellow grocery shopper blamed them for the coronavirus and shoved the husband in the parking lot. 
""This time it was shoving. What if next time someone wants to run them over with their car?"" said Bo Thao-Urabe, the group's executive director. 
Minnesota's Asian American and Pacific Islander communities are joining state and federal Democratic lawmakers in urging new legislation to improve hate-crime reporting and police training in the state. They say there's renewed urgency after the recent deadly shootings of six Asian American women and two others in Atlanta, in addition to ongoing harassment here and elsewhere that threatens to outlast the pandemic. 
""We must condemn it universally,"" U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said at a news conference on Wednesday in support of federal and state legislative proposals. ""We must remember that our destinies are tied together: An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us."" 
State Rep. Frank Hornstein, DFL-Minneapolis, is again sponsoring legislation to let community groups file hate crime reports and to update police training guidelines. The bill would make graffiti and other acts of property damage eligible to be counted as bias crimes. 
Hate crime data in the U.S. has been historically uneven: The FBI produces an annual tally each year, but those numbers come from voluntary reporting from police nationwide. Not all states participate, and while Minnesota police agencies are required to submit data on ""bias-motivated incidents"" to the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA), many of the state's largest police departments routinely report having investigated no cases each year. 
""So many thousands of hate crimes are not reported, and when they go underreported they are not discussed and the perpetrators are not held accountable,"" Hornstein said. 
What data does exist points to an upward trend of anti-Asian hate crimes around the country. A recent study by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, found such incidents climbed nearly 150% in 16 of the country's largest cities last year, even while hate crimes dropped overall. 
The BCA has not released data on hate crimes in 2020 but last reported a slight increase in overall bias incidents from 2018 to 2019. 
Last week, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison convened the first of multiple virtual roundtable discussions on stopping AAPI hate. Local Department of Justice leaders and elected officials including Ramsey County Attorney John Choi participated. 
""This is not only a conversation, this is a call to action,"" said Ellison, who announced a task force. ""We are going to keep the pressure on. We are going to keep working hard and we are going to protect the community."" 
Surge in incidents 
U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has cited the surge in incidents against Asian Americans in ordering a 30-day review of how the Justice Department can best curb hate crimes. 
""These sensational events are a rallying call for action, but it is up to us to do the rest of the work,"" said Rep. Samantha Vang, DFL-Brooklyn Center, who is co-sponsoring the House bill with Hornstein. 
Omar is also co-sponsoring a resolution to call on all public officials to denounce anti-Asian racism related to COVID-19 and asking federal officials ""to expeditiously investigate and document all credible reports of hate crimes and incidents and threats against the Asian-American community and prosecute perpetrators."" 
Democrats on Wednesday repeated calls for the Republican-led Minnesota Senate to hold a hearing on Hornstein and Vang's proposal, which passed a House committee last week on a 10-8 party-line vote. 
Their bill's chances of success are slim in the Senate, where a GOP spokeswoman said Wednesday that Sen. Warren Limmer, the Maple Grove Republican who leads the Judiciary Committee, will focus only on passing a budget for the remainder of the 2021 
session. 
Rachel Aplikowski, the GOP Senate spokeswoman, said law enforcement groups have expressed concerns that adding additional reforms on top of new training requirements passed last year would be difficult to implement in a timely manner. 
Gender identity issue 
Other Republican state lawmakers have cited the House bill's protections for gender identity in their objections. 
""I believe in science. I believe if you have an XY chromosome you're a male, if you have a YY chromosome you're a female,"" said State Rep. Eric Lucero, R-Dayton. ""And the language here is going to put Minnesotans in the awkward position of being science deniers and having to choose science over somebody's confusion."" 
Lucero unsuccessfully tried to add an amendment making officers immune from claims that they did not properly investigate bias crimes based on gender identity. 
""The bottom line of civil rights and human rights laws in the state is that everybody is protected, no exceptions,"" Hornstein said.",5251
Xiaojie Tan dreamed of traveling the world and celebrating her 50th birthday with her daughter. Then the Atlanta shooter ended her life.,"Hughes, Trevor; Ruiz-Goriena, Romina; Kelly, Cara; Clark, Sirena",USA Today,2021-03-19,"ATLANTA — On her 50th birthday Xiaojie Tan would have gathered with her only child for a slice of strawberry fresh cream cake her favorite.
The mother and daughter were best friends.
But the day before Tan would have celebrated her many accomplishments – making a life in the United States building a family launching two businesses – a gunman broke into her business and opened fire killing her and three others in a shooting rampage. He went on to kill another four people at two other spas.
Instead Jami Webb 29 and her father Michael Webb 64 spent Tan’s birthday planning her funeral at a Catholic church.
“She did everything for me and for the family. She provided everything. She worked every day 12 hours a day so that me and our family would have a better life” Jami Webb said of her mother.
Like Tan most of the victims of the shooting attacks were of Asian descent drawing new attention to an ongoing wave of hate crimes against Asian Americans across the country fueled by racism and xenophobia amid the COVID-19 outbreak and anti-China rhetoric expressed by many conservative leaders including former President Donald Trump.
As dusk fell Thursday night father daughter and her fiancé stood outside Young's Asian Massage in Acworth watching a small candlelight vigil honoring the dead.
No one there knew who they were and neither Webb sought any attention or recognition.
Some called her by her Chinese name Xiaojie or Jay for short. Others knew her by her American name Emily.
In China it is customary to put the family name before the given name. Tan's name in Chinese transliterated to Tan Xiao Jie which means pure or honest. However because Western countries use the surname last her legal name in the United States is Xiaojie Tan.
""She was full of smiles and laughter. She was just a pleasure to be around” said Michael Webb an American businessman who first met Tan while traveling for work in China in the early 2000s.
He angrily rejected speculation Tan's spa was providing sex services.
""You're coming here to get a massage. All these girls that have worked for her over the years are working for her on their own free will"" he said. ""They’re here for a better life. They’re diligent and work hard and all the money they make is going toward a better life for their family.”
Hynson said he last saw Tan over the weekend when he stopped by the spa to chat.
“I can’t put any reasoning behind why anyone would want to do something horrible to such nice people"" he said. ""I can’t wrap my head around it. I just can’t believe she’s gone.”

Saying goodbye to a mother and best friend
Jami Webb said her mother was obsessed with the idea of traveling and devoured travel stories from her customers adding new destinations to her running list whenever they came back from a trip: Alaska. Europe. Sweden.
Whenever a customer walked in Tan always had the same question: “where have you traveled?”
If it was a new location or country she would add it to her retirement wish list.
Jami Webb said she was proud of her mother and the business she had built. “She loved to make friends with all her customers"" she said.
Earlier that day Jami Webb went to her mothers' house and found drawers full of new clothes.
“They still had all the tags on"" Jami Webb said the petals blowing from flowering Bradford pear trees sticking to her teary eyes. ""She didn’t even have a chance to wear them.”
Meanwhile in China family members gathered to celebrate what should have been Tan's 50th birthday. 
Jami said her aunt her mother's sister Tan Mei had heart problems and needed to be put on oxygen when she found out about the killings.
""My sister was a very kind and caring person. She was always thinking about her family she cared very much for her friends"" Tan Mei told USA TODAY Friday sobbing over the phone from Nanning China. 
She said Tan would call every day to speak to her family in China while on her way to work. She said could not fathom why someone would do such a senseless thing to her sister. The family couldn't bring themselves to tell Tan's mother that her daughter was dead. Instead the family cut a cake and called Jami Webb to ask about the guest of honor. ""She kept asking to talk to my mom. We told my grandma that my mom lost her phone and couldn't answer"" Jami Webb said.",4387
Man on parole for killing his mom charged with hate crime assault in New York City attack on Asian American woman,Ryan W. Miller,USA Today,2021-03-31,"NEW YORK — Police on Wednesday said a man suspected of brutally assaulting an Asian American woman in broad daylight was arrested after surveillance video of the attack drew widespread condemnation.
In a court appearance late Wednesday Brandon Elliot 38 of New York City was remanded into custody. His next court date is set for Monday. He was charged with two counts of assault in the second degree as a hate crime and one count of attempted assault in the first degree as a hate crime the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said.
The Legal Aid Society which is representing Elliot said in a statement: ""We strongly urge the public to reserve judgment until all the facts are presented in court.""
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance described the incident as a ""brutal attack.""
""There is no place for these atrocious acts of violence in New York"" Vance said in a statement.
The attack occurred before noon Monday outside a luxury apartment building in Midtown Manhattan. The suspect hurled anti-Asian sentiments and assaulted the 65-year-old woman New York Police Department said.

Surveillance video from inside the building captured images of a man kicking and stomping the woman repeatedly. In a short version of the video staff do not immediately appear to intervene but a longer video shared with local media shows building staff aiding the woman after the suspect flees.
The woman was hospitalized with serious injuries but released Tuesday. Vance's office said that the woman was diagnosed with diagnosed with a fractured pelvis forehead contusions and contusions across her body.
The woman's daughter speaking with The New York Times identified her as Vilma Kari and said her mother emigrated from the Philippines. The Times did not identify the daughter.
In a GoFundMe Elizabeth Kari identifies herself as Vilma Kari's daughter and said her mother has been ""humbled by the outpouring of messages and support from not only our friends and family but from the kind souls all over the world. I am happy to share she is safe and in good spirits."" The GoFundMe has raised more than $76000 as of Thursday afternoon.
On the GoFundMe page Kari wrote that someone across the street who has not been identified shouted at her mother's assailant to get his attention and draw him away. ""This gesture of action is what we need in our world right now. I hope one day my mom and I can thank you personally"" she wrote.
Police said the woman was walking to church when she was attacked. The man shouted anti-Asian slurs at her and told her ""You don’t belong here"" police said.
“Let me be clear: this brave woman belongs here. Asian-American New Yorkers belong here. Everyone belongs here. Attacks against Asian-American New Yorkers are attacks against all New Yorkers and my Office will continue to stand against hate in all its forms"" Vance said in a statement.
Elliot was living in a hotel nearby that serves as a homeless shelter police said. Elliot was convicted of stabbing his mother to death in the Bronx in 2002 when he was 19 online court records show. He was released from prison in 2019 and is on lifetime parole.
“For the life of me I don’t understand why we are releasing or pushing people out of prison – not to give them second chances but to put them into homeless facilities or shelters or in this case a hotel – and expect good outcomes” Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said at a news conference Wednesday. “We need real opportunities. We need real safety nets.”
Officials in New York City and beyond swiftly condemned the attack and highlighted how it was another case in a growing number of incidents of anti-Asian hate and discrimination amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
More than 3795 incidents were reported to Stop AAPI Hate from March 19 2020 to Feb. 28 2021 “only a fraction of the number of hate incidents that actually occur” the advocacy group said. The organization tracks incidents of hate violence harassment and discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the U.S.
Mayor Bill de Blasio called the incident “absolutely disgusting and outrageous” and said it was “absolutely unacceptable” that witnesses did not intervene.
In a statement the head of the union representing the building workers disputed the allegation that workers did not act.
“Our union is working to get further details for a more complete account and urges the public to avoid a rush to judgment while the facts are determined” union president Kyle Bragg said.
The union initially said the workers immediately called for help but on Wednesday said they waited until the attacker left to aid the woman and flag a police car.
A video released to PIX11 shows staff waiting until the attacker appears to leave the area before going outside to assist the woman. The TV station reported the workers waited because they believed the suspect had a knife.
Detective Michael Rodriguez said Wednesday that patrol officers came upon the victim after she was assaulted.
The management company of the apartment building where the attack occurred said Monday that it had suspended the staff members pending an investigation.
""The Brodsky Organization condemns all forms of discrimination racism xenophobia and violence against the Asian American community"" the company said.
The victim “could easily have been my mother” said Andrew Yang a mayoral candidate and the son of Taiwanese immigrants. Yang also called bystanders' apparent inaction ""exactly the opposite of what we need here in New York City.""
Gov. Andrew Cuomo also weighed in calling the attack ""horrifying and repugnant.""
Police sought the public's help in the case and have said they were increasing patrols in predominantly Asian communities amid the spike in incidents. In New York City there have been 33 hate crimes with an Asian victim as of Sunday compared with 11 as of this time last year the NYPD said.
In Washington on Tuesday Attorney General Merrick Garland announced a 30-day review to assess the government's tracking capabilities and prosecution of hate offenses.

End hate crimes against Asian Americans,"Kania, Elsa and Zhang, Chenny",USA Today,2020-04-16,"Recent hate crimes and violent assaults against people of Asian descent should sound an alarm for America. Within the past month, an acid attack against a woman in New York caused her to suffer severe burns, and a man in Texas was charged with attempted murder after attacking an Asian American family.Such stories have become disturbingly frequent since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the FBI has warned that this trend may continue.On March 20, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights expressed concern over violent attacks against people of Asian descent. Asian American and Pacific Islander leaders have condemned such bigotry.And a bipartisan coalition of nearly 200 foreign policy and national security professionals support this letter condemning hate crimes and calling for solidarity (see the full list at USATODAY.com/opinion/).There are many ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic has brought out the best of our nation: health care workers laboring around the clock, scientists racing to develop a vaccine. Alarmingly, however, the crisis has also exacerbated prejudice.All Americans must redouble the fight against those forces.U.S. leaders must take action against anti-Asian racism by adhering to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which details ways to reduce and avoid stigma and discrimination. Terms such as ""Chinese virus"" stoke discrimination.America has a history of associating immigrants with diseases. We must learn from that painful history and continue to fight to uphold greater equality of rights and opportunity. America is strongest when it lives up to its guiding principles, including the embrace of diversity and inclusion.History teaches us that injustice and divisions in the United States can be exploited by other governments. These issues can play into the Chinese Communist Party's propaganda in ways that undermine U.S. unity, national interests and global leadership while weakening Washington's critiques of Beijing's human rights abuses.U.S. policies must also address the inequities, including access to health care, that are causing African Americans, Native Americans, Latinx and other communities to disproportionately experience the worst impacts of COVID-19.",2237
'They look at me and think I'm some kind of virus': What it's like to be Asian during the coronavirus pandemic,"Phillips, Kristine",USA Today,2020-03-28,"Carl Chan was shopping at the San Francisco Premium Outlets when he covered his mouth to cough a little. A couple standing about 20 to 30 feet away from him stared in alarm. The woman turned and ran away. Another time, he was walking down an Oakland street with a group of people when someone started coughing. It wasn’t Chan, but people turned around, glared at him and covered their mouth. The dirty looks happened weeks ago, before California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered the state's 40 million residents to stay at home. Before President Donald Trump referred to the deadly COVID-19 as the ""Chinese virus."" Before the coronavirus pandemic sent the country’s economy into a tailspin. And before it killed hundreds of Americans and infected thousands more. “They look at me and think I’m some kind of virus,” said Chan, president of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce. Anti-Asian American sentiment: Asian American lawmakers sound the alarm on coronavirus-related discrimination. Across the U.S., Asian Americans have become the target of xenophobic and bigoted attacks as the pandemic wreaks havoc in American society. Experts said the scapegoating is fueled by harmful rhetoric from politicians, including the president, who later called for the protection of Asian Americans from xenophobic attacks after repeatedly calling COVID-19 the ""Chinese virus."" In recent months, people of Asian descent – not just Chinese Americans – have been shunned, verbally abused, name-called, coughed and spat on, even physically assaulted, said Russell Jeung, chair of the Asian American Studies Department at San Francisco State University who’s been studying bias-related incidents against Asian Americans during the coronavirus epidemic. The scapegoating is reminiscent of old racist tropes that led to discriminatory policies against Asian immigrants in the United States – from the quarantining of San Francisco’s Chinatown during the bubonic plague of the 1900s, to the rounding up of Japanese Americans in internment camps during World War II, experts and advocates said. Wearing face masks, a practice that began in Asian countries for cultural and environmental reasons and has crossed over to immigrant communities in the United States, has now become a racialized symbol of the virus. “If you’re wearing a mask, you’re seen as a disease carrier. If you’re not wearing a mask, you’re seen as a disease carrier but negligent,” Jeung said. In New York City, the Commission on Human Rights, which investigates incidents of harassment, discrimination and bias, has received a “sharp increase” in calls about COVID-19 related discrimination that includes incidents of bias against Asian Americans, spokeswoman Alicia McCauley said. McCauley said she’s unable to give an exact number, but the agency is receiving calls daily. The New York Police Department is investigating an attack against a woman who was yelled at and assaulted at a subway station. A viral video shows the woman, who appeared to be of Asian descent and was wearing a mask, running as a man chased and struck her.

The department’s Hate Crimes Task Force tweeted Monday that it was aware of reports of “several COVID-19 related hate crimes” and “arrests have been made in most cases.” NYPD’s spokesman did not respond to questions, including how many reports and arrests have been made, or if the victims were of Asian descent. The state’s attorney general, Letitia James, also recently launched a hotline for New Yorkers to report hate crimes related to coronavirus. “No one should live in fear for their lie because of who they are, what they look like, or where they come from,” James said in a statement Monday. In Bellevue, Washington, police chief Steve Mylett said he’s seen a 178% increase in the number of applications for firearm transfers. The state requires firearm dealerships to report all firearm transfers to local police. Mylett said a significant number of applicants appeared to have last names consistent with Chinese heritage. Harassment and other bias-related incidents have “put enough fear into them that they felt like they needed to arm themselves to protect themselves and their families,” Mylett said. But despite the abundance of anecdotal evidence reported in the media and by advocacy groups, many police departments, including Mylett’s, said they have not seen any significant uptick in the number of hate-crime reports related to COVID-19. This suggests that people may be hesitant, if not fearful, to go to police. The rhetoric: Trump uses China as a foil when talking coronavirus, distancing himself from criticism. That’s a concern for Mylett. Hate crimes normally start as aggressive comments that don’t rise to the level of a crime before they escalate into physical violence, he said. “So the earlier law enforcement can intervene, then hopefully we’ll be able to prevent somebody (from) being victimized and somebody making a decision that will land them in jail for a long time,” Mylett said. Jeung, the San Francisco State professor, said there are several reasons why people may not want to report to police. Many Asian Americans are culturally reticent to deal with the government, he said. Some fled authoritarian regimes from their home countries and are inherently distrustful of authority. Some also came to the United States illegally and are fearful of calling attention to themselves. Language barriers can also be an issue. Jeung and two advocacy groups in California recently launched a website allowing people to report incidents anonymously. They have received 673 responses over the past week from across the country, many of which came from New York and California, where majority of the United States’ Asian populations live, according to their report. The incidents involved not only Chinese Americans, but also Japanese, Koreans, Taiwanese, Vietnamese and Filipinos – a clear case of racial profiling against Asian Americans, Jeung said. Some said they were barred from business establishments, yelled at by cashiers and customers who accused them of bringing the virus to the country. Some said Lyft and Uber drivers refused to give them rides. Some reported being coughed at and spat on. “While we were passing a group of four men, one of them coughed into me, not once, but TWICE, without covering his mouth. As I turned my head back, they all burst out laughing,” one respondent wrote. Join USA TODAY's Facebook group, 'Coronavirus Watch,' dedicated to sharing accurate information, asking experts questions and building community as COVID-19 spreads around the world. Visit the group. Another respondent reported being called “patient 0 and a virus spreader” online. Another said a man threw a drink in their face while saying “they should be banned.” The shunning and verbal assaults were not just committed by adults, according to the report. One respondent said two teenage girls screamed and covered their own faces while on the train. Another reported hearing a young girl telling her parents she was going to die. After the parents asked why, “she said coronavirus and pointed in my direction,” the respondent wrote. The rhetoric: GOP senator says China 'to blame' for coronavirus spread because of 'culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs.' Cynthia Choi, co-director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, one of the organizations that launched the website, acknowledged that the online reporting does not guard against fictitious reports and online trolls. But she said the reports show clear similarities in the tone of the harassment and attacks. “We are definitely seeing patterns and can only base this assessment on this honor system that people are reporting what’s really happening to them,” Choi said. Choi warned that in the age of Internet and social media, harmful rhetoric, misinformation and conspiracy theories can spread faster than the virus. Advocates also urged against using the geographical origin of the virus when referring to it publicly. “Because that’s morally reprehensible, and it doesn’t help us solve the problem,” said Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council. “None of us would feel good about being labeled a virus. It’s disruptive. It’s physically and emotionally harmful.” On Monday, Trump called Asian Americans ""amazing people"" and said the epidemic is ""NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form."" In Oakland’s Chinatown, the scapegoating has led to a slump in business, said Chan, who immigrated from Hong Kong 40 years ago. Family establishments, many of which were started years ago by elderly residents who came to the United States for a better future for their families, began seeing significant drops in their business. Before California's shelter-in-place order took effect, many small business owners turned to their personal savings to keep their businesses open and make sure their employees still had jobs, Chan said. “Personally, I feel very sad … When I’m quietly sitting down, I just feel so sad,” Chan said, his voice breaking. “Many of us are really suffering. Attacks, especially to our seniors, it really hurts … Many of them don’t know how to defend themselves.” This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: 'They look at me and think I'm some kind of virus': What it's like to be Asian during the coronavirus pandemic.

"'We just want to be safe': Hate crimes, harassment of Asian Americans rise amid coronavirus pandemic.","Phillips, Kristine",USA Today,2020-05-20,"In California’s Alameda County, a Chinese American man was screamed at while mowing his lawn. The local prosecutor said the man was told to get out of America.In neighboring Santa Clara County, a Vietnamese couple was threatened while in a grocery store. Officials said the man turned his hand into the shape of a gun.In New York City, people of Asian descent were assaulted, kicked, pushed and accosted on subway trains.The theme: This virus is your fault.People of Asian descent have reported being shunned, verbally abused, name-called, coughed and spat on, even physically assaulted as the coronavirus pandemic continues to 
upend American life. As the political rhetoric blaming China for the pandemic escalates, law enforcement officials and human rights advocates have seen an increasing number 
of hate crimes and incidents of harassment and discrimination against Asian Americans.'They ... think I'm some kind of virus': What it's like to be Asian during the coronavirus pandemic.New York City, for example, has seen 16 coronavirus-related hate crime incidents; many of which involved Asian victims. The city’s human rights commission has received 
hundreds of harassment and discrimination complaints since February, the majority of which involved anti-Asian sentiments.Police and prosecutors are on high alert, releasing public service announcements, holding town hall meetings and opening hotlines to ask people to report hate crimes and hate 
speech that, while not criminal, could escalate to violence.“We have a large Asian population, and we have a lot of elderly Asian population who are getting scared to death about being preyed upon by somebody who’s willing to resort 
to that behavior,” said Nancy O’Malley, the district attorney of Alameda County, where Asians are 32% of the population. “You have one ethnic group that’s targeted … and 
ignorant people who think they can just scream at somebody because of their ethnicity. ... We cannot tolerate that.”O’Malley said there have been no hate crimes in her county, but there have been several incidents of verbal assaults and harassment that don’t rise to the level of a crime. Still, 
O’Malley’s office has encouraged people to report such incidents.COVID-19 and racism: Asian American lawmakers sound the alarm on coronavirus-related discrimination.“Speech is not a crime,” she said, “(but) we want to make sure we’re intervening before it becomes a crime, to educate somebody about cultures and diversity.”In Seattle, schoolteacher Kert Lin was driving into a Home Depot parking lot when another driver screamed at him: ""Open your eyes! Go back to China!""Lin said the incident, which happened not far from Seattle's international district, rattled him. He told the Seattle Police Department what happened, but he said because no 
crime was committed, there's nothing police can do.""This is also our city,"" he said. ""We just want to be safe.""In Stevens Point, Wisconsin, about 2½ hours from Milwaukee, police arrested a man who they said harassed Asian customers for wearing a mask inside a grocery store. In 
Santa Clara County, the man who threatened the Vietnamese couple by turning his hand into the shape of a gun has been charged with a misdemeanor hate crime.“I wish we didn’t have the one case, but the fact that we only had one case is a testament to the people that live here,” Santa Clara District Attorney Jeff Rosen said, although 
he added that hate crimes are historically underreported. Asians are about 38% of the county’s population.Rosen’s office recently published a public service announcement calling on people to not assign places and nationalities to the pandemic. The World Health Organization has 
urged scientists, government officials and the media to avoid using geographic locations as names for public health crises.“This isn’t the fault of Chinese Americans that are here. … Asian Americans are very well integrated into our society,” Rosen said. “If you’re turning on the TV news to hear about 
the latest research from Stanford about COVID-19, you might be looking at an Asian American epidemiologist.”Isolated and scared: The plight of juveniles locked up during the coronavirus pandemicPolicing during a pandemic: Police agencies are using drones to enforce stay-at-home orders, raising concerns among civil rights groups The FBI usually collects hate crime data, but the agency does not have nationwide statistics on violence tied to COVID-19. In a statement, the bureau said:""The FBI will use all authority granted to us by federal law to investigate and hold those who commit violent acts accountable for their actions. The FBI remains committed to 
our mission to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution"".In New York City, Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison said last month that the police department has arrested 11 people for hate crimes against Asians.The New York City Commission on Human Rights said it has received more than 300 harassment and discrimination complaints related to COVID-19 this year; 117 of which – 
nearly 40% – involved anti-Asian sentiments.'It would cripple us completely': Coronavirus takes toll on rural police agencies.“The numbers alone are quite astonishing,” said Carmelyn Malalis, head of the commission. Around the same time period last year, the commission received only five reports of 
anti-Asian harassment and discrimination, Malalis said.Malalis is no stranger to racist taunts. The daughter of Filipino immigrants remembers being told she doesn’t belong in America. As a child, she said other children mocked her 
Asian ancestry by slanting their eyes at her. Malalis said she has not personally experienced similar verbal taunts because of COVID-19, but she has heard from friends who 
have.“What people have to remember is that … just because I’m a Filipino, just because someone’s Chinese, Vietnamese, what have you, does not mean they’re not going through 
the same kinds of challenges,” Malalis said. “Having to telework while taking care of children, having to take care of their loved ones, worrying about people in the community, 
experiencing loss. … Everyone is going through these exact challenges. Asian Americans should not have to go through, on top of that, be discriminated against.”Still, the political rhetoric that advocates say fuels hate against Asians living in America has continued.In early May, a super PAC that supports President Donald Trump released an anti-China ad that attacks presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden for being lenient 
on the country.“China is killing our jobs,” a male voice says, “and now killing our people.”

'An unbelievable chain of oppression': America's history of racism was a preexisting condition for COVID-19,"Alan Gomez, Wyatte Grantham-Philips, Trevor Hughes, Rick Jervis, Rebecca Plevin, Kameel Stanley, Dennis Wagner, Marco della Cava, Deborah Barfield Berry, Mark Nichols",USA Today,2020-10-12,"A Louisiana pastor prays as his parishioners die, first from cancer and now from COVID-19. An Indigenous community in New Mexico lacks adequate health care as the death toll mounts. A sick hospital worker in New Jersey frets about infecting others in her heavily populated neighborhood.As the country cries out for a vaccine and a return to normal, lost in the policy debates is the reality that COVID-19 kills far more people of color than white Americans. This isn't a matter of coincidence, poor choices or bad luck — it's by design.A team of USA TODAY reporters explored how the policies of the past and present have made Black, Asian, Hispanic and Indigenous Americans prime targets for COVID-19. They found:America's education and economic systems are still unequal, disproportionately leaving people of color out of higher-wage jobs. When COVID-19 struck, more people of color were serving as essential workers directly in the path of the virus.Decades of discrimination in housing corralled people of color into tightly packed neighborhoods, fueling the virus' spread. Those neighborhoods tend to lie in ""food deserts,"" leading to diabetes, obesity and heart disease that make people more likely to die from the virus.Environmental policies designed by white power brokers at the expense of the poor has poisoned the air they breathe, fueling cancers and leaving communities weakened in the path of the virus. A lack of federal funding left the most vulnerable communities cut off from healthcare at the most critical moment.Put simply, America's history of racism was itself a preexisting condition.Of the 10 U.S. counties with the highest death rates from COVID-19, seven have populations where people of color make up the majority, according to data compiled by USA TODAY. Of the top 50 counties with the highest death rates, 31 are populated mostly by people of color.""COVID-19 has brought out into the open, with painful clarity, these divisions in our society that have been there for a long time but, for one reason or another, people were able to overlook them,"" said Philip Landrigan, director of the Global Public Health Program at Boston College.With nearly 1,000 people a day dying from the virus and scientists scrambling to grasp exactly how the virus spreads and kills, federal and state data has not provided enough demographic detail to show the full impact on communities of color. The race and ethnicity of people who contract the virus is known in 52% of cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.But study after study has shown clear patterns in whom the virus kills.Black people are more than twice as likely to die from the virus than white people, and Hispanics and Native Americans are 1.5 times more likely to die, according to The COVID Tracking Project.""You can't change the fact that America is so segregated and that people of color tend to live in communities where the environmental conditions are worse, and that can increase your risk of heart disease or lung disease and diabetes,"" said Richard Besser, former acting director of the CDC and president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the nation’s largest philanthropy dedicated solely to health care. ""You can't change that in the short run.""A team of USA TODAY reporters pored over lawsuits challenging housing and health care policies, analyzed demographic data for communities hit hardest by COVID-19 and studied documents that reveal how government and business leaders worked together to marginalize populations. They interviewed the descendants of enslaved Americans who were denied homeownership in white neighborhoods and Indigenous Americans who had been funneled into reservations in exchange for federally funded health care that never came. They walked through Black communities on the fence line of polluting chemical plants, spent time with Latino farmworkers unable to afford the very food they harvested, and entered the homes of Asian immigrants afraid of being attacked by neighbors if they tested positive for the coronavirus.Housing policies speed spread of virusIn Essex County, New Jersey, decades of housing policies, laws and unspoken pacts excluded communities of color from spacious suburbs and forced them to cram into poor, often neglected neighborhoods in the urban core of Newark. Now, Essex has the 12th-highest death rate from COVID-19 in the country, according to data compiled by USA TODAY, fueled in large part by the high numbers of Black Americans living in segregated, low-income neighborhoods.That includes Ahou Yao, 40, a respiratory therapist at a local hospital who contracted COVID-19 in April and was forced to self-isolate in her bedroom in the two-bedroom apartment she shares with her husband and two young boys. She struggled from fever, shortness of breath and body aches and was unable to work for a month. Her husband had to go out for food, run errands and navigate their crowded neighborhood.""Now I'm scared,"" she said, ""scared that he has it, too.""Her husband has since developed a cough and chest pains, prompting a trip to the emergency room. He started self-isolating, passing the responsibility of venturing outside back to his wife.Environmental policies make people vulnerableIn Louisiana, along a stretch of the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, former slave plantations house massive chemical plants that spew chemicals deemed dangerous by the Environmental Protection Agency. When the plants were constructed, white homeowners had the means to move away, in time leaving a mostly Black population to breathe toxic air and suffer from such high rates of cancer that the entire region was dubbed ""Cancer Alley.""One of those plants, in St. John the Baptist Parish, is the only one in the nation that produces neoprene. The synthetic rubber is used to make wetsuits and laptop cases, and the emissions from the production process are so harmful that the EPA lists the predominantly Black neighborhood next door to the plant as having the highest risk of cancer in the entire country. In September, St. John the Baptist Parish had the 27th highest death rate from COVID-19 in the nation, according to a USA TODAY analysis.The Rev. Lionel Murphy of the Tchoupitoulas Chapel, which sits 2 miles from the chloroprene plant, has counseled many Black families over the years as they’ve come down with diabetes, respiratory illnesses and rare cancers. Now, he’s seeing his neighbors die from COVID-19. And still, smoke billows from the plant down the road.""People get sick, people die, you go bury them,"" Murphy said. ""But there’s no fight to erase the problem.""Health care missing when neededIn McKinley County, New Mexico, many locals struggle to find health care.Year after year, Congress has failed to allocate enough money to fulfill its legal obligation to provide health care to Indigenous tribes, including the Navajo, Hopi and Zuni people who make up the majority of McKinley County’s population. A 2018 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights titled ""Broken Promises"" found the federal government spends nearly four times as much on health per person through government programs than it spends for each Indigenous person.Anna Marie Rondon, executive director of the New Mexico Social Justice and Equity Institute in McKinley County (who is Diné, as the Navajo people call themselves), said the ravages of COVID-19 are not an isolated tragedy but the latest chapter in Indigenous people’s long history of abuse and neglect from the U.S. government.On the Navajo Nation, inadequate resources have resulted in widespread water poverty, food insecurity and high rates of illness. These daily realities were devastating long before the pandemic, but they’ve also helped fuel a high COVID-19 death rate.""It's really an unbelievable chain of oppression – it's still squeezing us, it still has its grip,"" Rondon said. ""And it's still killing us.""Food deserts make people vulnerableIn California, Imperial Valley is considered the nation’s winter breadbasket, producing 80% of the country’s fresh vegetables during the cold months. But the predominantly Hispanic workers who pick alfalfa, lettuce, sugar beets and carrots can rarely afford to buy them.Nearly 75% of adults and 13% of children are obese or overweight for their age, according to state data. On the other end of the spectrum, 31% of kids in Imperial County don't get enough to eat each day, according to a 2018 report by Feeding America, a national anti-hunger organization based in Washington, D.C.""If they're already on food stamps, to spend the extra money to get fruits and vegetables, it's expensive,"" said Jessica Solorio, executive director of Spread the Love, a local food bank.Those figures show why COVID-19 has been so fatal in the county, with 16 deaths per 10,000, nearly three times the national average, according to the USA TODAY analysis.Cultural barriers complicate responseIn San Francisco, community activists are worried that the number of Asian Americans getting COVID-19 is being vastly underreported.Of the county’s nearly 12,000 positive test results, only 12% are Asian American, yet Asian Americans have made up 38% of the death count. Experts attribute that alarming disconnect to a number of factors, including the fear of losing a job after a positive test, language barriers, lack of health care, growing anti-Asian hate crimes, and what’s called the ""model-minority myth"" – an assumption that education and financial successes enjoyed by some Asian Americans applies to all 20-some Asian ethnicities.Judy Young, executive director of the Southeast Asian Development Center, a nonprofit that helps residents from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, said her community suffers from an average household income a quarter of the city’s average, low high school graduation rates and obstacles to health care. Add a COVID-19 testing regime tailored to those proficient in English and an often fatalistic attitude toward the pandemic in the community, and Young said the virus has been painful to the Asian American community.""I've asked our clients why they're not getting tested,"" she said. ""Often the reaction I get is, 'I'm going to die anyway, and if I test positive, then I can't go to work.""'We become invisible'Ask Beverly Wright, executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, why so many people of color across the U.S. are dying from COVID-19 and she goes back 400 years to the arrival of the first enslaved Africans to colonial U.S. shores.Racism is so entrenched in the American way of life, she said, that it's impossible to separate the high death rates of marginalized communities from the nation’s historic treatment of each of them. From the broken promises of reparations to the terrible treatment of immigrants, from redlining practices that excluded Black Americans from homeownership to the GI Bill money that went mostly to white service members returning from World War II, Wright says COVID-19 is once again revealing the precarious position people of color often find themselves in.But with no national response from the federal government and only limited actions taken by states or localities, Wright said her people are still stuck in the same situation: invisible.""We have built-in systems that work against Black people moving up the economic ladder,"" Wright said. ""That pattern continues.""Racism is so entrenched that we become invisible.""MORE IN THIS SERIESRacism turned their neighborhood into 'Cancer Alley.’ Now they’re dying from COVID-19.In New Jersey’s most segregated county, racism and coronavirus made a ‘vicious circle’Asian Americans in San Francisco are dying at alarming rates from COVID-19: Racism is to blame'Still killing us': The federal government underfunded health care for Indigenous people for centuries.

Virus ravages San Francisco's Asian American communities,Marco della Cava,USA Today,2020-10-21,"SAN FRANCISCO – Mandy Rong was terrified her 12-year-old daughter had COVID-19. It was 2 a.m. and the young girl was hours into a fierce fever and a racking cough.""Mommy, why are my eyes on fire?"" asked Amy Rong.The mother and daughter, along with Rong's parents, live in an 80-square-foot windowless single-room-occupancy Chinatown building that is a home of last resort for many impoverished Asian immigrants. Hallways are cramped, bathrooms and kitchens are communal. A ripe setting for the spread of the highly contagious novel coronavirus.That early March night felt endless. Rong, 42, repeatedly touched Amy's forehead, wondering if her child would die in the small loft that the two shared. Down below, her father slept on the floor while her mother took the lone sofa bed.In the morning, the fever had vanished, only to return a week later. Once again, the family endured a restless night. Rong made soup, but Amy wouldn't eat it.Getting tested for COVID-19 didn't seem like an option for the Rongs. The rumor was that the tests were expensive. Rong also feared the reaction from neighbors.""If you test positive, everyone would be scared of you,"" said Rong. ""Everyone would think you are the devil.""It is easy to mistake San Francisco for a thriving Asian American haven. The city, which is its own county, boasts a bustling Chinatown, as well as a popular Japantown. Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, Vietnamese, Indians and Filipinos also have made their homes here. All told, Asians in San Francisco represent upward of 20 countries.But many Asian American immigrants in the county lead a fragile existence rendered even more precarious with the arrival of COVID-19. So far, 38% of the 123 COVID-19 deaths reported by the San Francisco Department of Public Health are Asian American residents, the most of any ethnicity.Experts also are concerned that positivity rates among Asian Americans in San Francisco could be far higher than the 12% reported, a by-product of the decades-in-the-making model minority myth, which characterizes this ethnic group as financially successful, physically healthy and upwardly mobile. This belief has caused segments of the Asian American community to long be overlooked when it comes to social services for housing, employment and health.San Francisco is one of the few places in the nation tracking data on Asian Americans and COVID-19 deaths at a time when officials don't know the ethnicity of the person affected in nearly half of the nation's 7.8 million coronavirus cases. Around 17 million Americans are of Asian descent, or 5.6% of the population.In many cases, Asian Americans in this city have received imprecise or no information in their native language about testing, safety tips, housing and other critical care services during the pandemic. At the same time, the community is struggling with inadequate access to comprehensive health care, the need to keep front-line employment and growing incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes.""This model minority thing, that's not us,"" said Judy Young, executive director of the Southeast Asian Development Center, a San Francisco nonprofit that helps area residents from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.""There is the language barrier and our community is small,"" Young said. ""So the city doesn't think we have any problems when we do.""That risk of invisibility is only heightened by the pandemic. Since city health officials do not break down COVID-19 statistics beyond ""Asian American,"" many advocates for the city's various groups said they are left to speculate about coronavirus infection and death rates within their individual communities. How many people are dying, and are those people Japanese Americans? Vietnamese? Filipino?""There's this feeling that there's excess death out there,"" said Jeffrey Caballero, executive director of the nonprofit Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations. ""That high mortality rate among Asian Americans means either there isn't enough testing or people are waiting far too long to get care.""What is the model minority myth?For many Asian Americans in San Francisco, the high rate of COVID-19 deaths is directly linked to the corrosive and distorting effects of the model minority myth, said Dr. Tung Nguyen, a University of California, San Francisco professor of medicine.Nguyen co-authored a report in May by the Asian American Research Center on Health that called attention to the fact that 50% of San Francisco's 31 COVID-19 deaths at that time were among Asian Americans, disproportionately high considering they make up just over a third of the population.To be sure, the fortunes and contributions of many Asian Americans have skyrocketed in past decades. The median annual income of households headed by the nation's 22 million Asian Americans is $73,060, compared with $53,600 for all U.S. households, according to the Pew Research Center.A closer look at San Francisco's two dozen Asian ethnicities reveals many groups within this broad categorization are struggling financially and remain outside the mainstream. About 43% are non-English speakers, according to a USA TODAY analysis of U.S. census data. About a third of San Franciscans are foreign-born, and 13% are not U.S. citizens.""With Asian Americans, the average always is pulled way up by those doing very well, which means you miss the groups who clearly are not,"" said Margaret Simms, a nonresident fellow with The Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., who specializes in race and labor economics. The think tank found nearly 13% of Asian American senior citizens live in poverty compared to a 9% national average.Discrimination also is keeping some Asian Americans from getting tested for COVID-19. The website Stop AAPI Hate, the acronym for Asian American Pacific Islander, has logged more than 2,500 incidents of discrimination across the U.S. since mid-March. The attacks have ranged from verbal assaults to acts of physical violence.When Asian Americans hear President Donald Trump, who contracted COVID-19 in October, repeatedly call the virus the ""China virus"" and ""Kung Flu,"" ""it makes them less likely to seek help, a bit like early in the AIDS epidemic when the gay community was stigmatized,"" said Karthick Ramakrishnan, professor of public policy at the University of California, Riverside and chair of the California Commission on Asian and Pacific Islander American Affairs.Decades of racist policiesChinese citizens began passing through San Francisco's then bridgeless Golden Gate en masse during the Gold Rush of 1849.By the late 1800s, the Chinese were not just vilified but outright barred from entering the country, with few exceptions, by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. White officials charged they were taking jobs from other Americans, despite having been integral to the Gold Rush's boom and the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad.At the height of World War II, Japanese Americans around the country were rounded up and sent to internment camps, feared as the traitorous ""yellow peril"" after years of citizenship. Despite painful and humiliating treatment at the hands of the U.S. government, many Asians resolved to engrain themselves in the society at large with an image of themselves as patriotic, hardworking Americans.The model minority image gained momentum during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Asian American success stories were highlighted by white U.S. officials both as a way of signaling to other nations, namely the Soviet Union, that America was not racist, but also to shame other ethnic groups, notably Black Americans.The logic went that if Asian Americans were doing so well, surely failure on the part of other ethnic groups was their own fault.Then came the Vietnam War, a quagmire that resulted in a U.S.-sponsored evacuation of 125,000 refugees followed by countless others who escaped Southeast Asia in rickety boats. Many landed in San Francisco.California Assemblymember David Chiu, a Democrat who represents the eastern half of San Francisco and chairs the California Asian & Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus, said lawmakers must recognize that Asian Americans are a loosely linked group of immigrants with distinct challenges and needs.""The attention being paid to the disparities endured during the pandemic by Black and Latinos is important, but our issue hasn't gotten the attention it deserves,"" he said.One small demographic victory for Asian Americans came in 1997 when President Bill Clinton directed the Office of Management and Budget to expand its data classification system to break out ""Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders"" from the Asian American group. That geographic list includes countries such as Micronesia, Tonga, Vanuatu, Guam, the Marshall Islands and Fiji.As a result, we know today that Pacific Islanders rank third in terms of COVID-19 deaths, behind Native Americans and Black Americans.A COVID-19 language barrierAsian American communities in San Francisco speak a range of languages including Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, Tagalog, Laotian, Samoan, Tongan, Vietnamese and Hindi. The city's website notes that COVID-19 information is available in English, Chinese, Filipino and Spanish.Efforts by city health officials to inform Asian residents about COVID-19 safety precautions and testing in their native languages have sometimes resulted in confusing or alienating translations.For example, information about pop-up virus testing sites sometimes can come across as demands, while in other cases the language is just plain confusing.One flyer written in the Filipino language of Tagalog told people to ""cover their entire face,"" said Luisa Antonio, executive director of the Bayanihan Equity Center, a Filipino American support group.Department of Public Health officials declined an interview request about outreach efforts.In California, about 5 million of 40 million state residents are Asian American, and in three-quarters of those homes, languages other than English are spoken regularly, according to the U.S. Census.Even some Asian Americans who speak fluent English said government officials have not made it easy to get information about the virus.Huiting ""Rita"" Huang grew alarmed when her mother-in-law told her that there had been a positive coronavirus case among the Chinese emigres to whom she was providing nursing services. The mother-in-law was unsure what to do and feared her poor English would make getting information about where to get tested even harder.Huang felt confident she could help. Her English was solid and she had experience getting COVID-19 information as a project coordinator and health educator for the nonprofit NICOS Chinese Health Coalition.After pursuing a series of online testing-site leads through a variety of city- and community-run websites – all requiring fluency in English – Huang soon learned that there were no available appointments at testing facilities close to their neighborhood.Huang eventually found a city-run testing site near Pier 30 along San Francisco Bay. The test was negative.""That was frustrating for me, and I speak English,"" said Huang. ""I can't imagine what it would be like for someone like my mother-in-law.""Some refuse to get testedAsian activists and health care workers trying to fill the void said they face a population that often is wary of Western medicine, fatalistic about getting the virus, culturally averse to passing along bad news to elders and nervous about losing employment.Kent Woo, executive director of the NICOS Chinese Health Coalition, said residents sometimes are suspicious of health care workers when they visit local low-income buildings to talk about coronavirus safety tips.""Folks say, 'What's the point of being tested?' or 'We don't know where to go if we get infected,'"" he said.The need is dire. Amy Dai, project coordinator for the Chinatown Community Development Center, an advocacy group that also manages low-income properties, learned that in a building she manages, 10 residents out of 30 families had tested positive.When she approached two of the residents who had come down with a fever, they assured her they couldn't be positive because they had not left the building. A subsequent visit to a doctor confirmed they had COVID-19.No end in sightRong never found out whether her daughter had COVID-19. But her days remain filled with dread.For the past few months, the family has had little money for food or rent.Rong doesn't know anyone who has contracted the virus. For her neighbors in the building, getting tested remains a common fear.Mostly, Rong waits for the day when the pandemic is over. For a day when it will feel safe to venture outside. For a day when her American dream can resume.

Asian Americans in San Francisco are dying at alarming rates from COVID-19: Racism is to blame,Marco della Cava,USA Today,2020-10-19,"SAN FRANCISCO – Mandy Rong was terrified her 12-year-old daughter had COVID-19. It was 2 a.m. and the young girl was hours into a fierce fever and a racking cough. She was weak and didn’t want to eat. What few medications were on hand had expired. She sipped warm water instead.“Mommy, why are my eyes on fire?” asked Amy Rong.The mother and daughter, along with Rong’s parents, live in an 80-square-foot windowless single-room-occupancy Chinatown building that is a home of last resort for many impoverished Asian immigrants.

Once again, the family endured a restless night. Rong made soup, but Amy wouldn’t eat it. She cooked porridge and spoon-fed it to her daughter.Getting tested for COVID-19 didn’t seem like an option for the Rongs. The rumor was that the tests were expensive.

Since city health officials do not break down COVID-19 statistics beyond “Asian American,” many advocates for the city’s various groups said they are left to speculate about coronavirus infection and death rates within their individual communities. How many people are dying, and are those people Japanese Americans? Vietnamese? Korean? Filipino? No one knows.“There’s this feeling that there's excess death out there,” said Jeffrey Caballero, executive director of the nonprofit Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations. “That high mortality rate among Asian Americans means either there isn’t enough testing or people are waiting far too long to get care.”What is the model minority myth?Xing Tam’s mother tested positive for COVID-19 in March. Her symptoms were mild. Medical officials told her to quarantine at home and avoid others.Suddenly, the working class Bayview district home where Tam, his mother and 17 other relatives and friends live together became uncomfortably crowded. Tam's mother was given one of the three-story home's 12 rooms. For weeks, everyone in the house moved about gingerly, hoping not to inflame the virus in their midst.Tam’s mother avoided the communal kitchen. Concerned about her health, she quietly voiced a worry to her son that she might not make it. He was too scared to offer any comforting reply.“I just told her, ‘Don’t be scared. You will be OK,’” said Tam, who emigrated from China in 2008 and works in the city at a restaurant. “But I was scared she might die.”America’s legacy of denying Asians access to equal health care and other social services is one that Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders like Wai Sing Lee know too well. A Chinatown social worker at the nonprofit NICOS Chinese Health Coalition, Lee said his team has spent the pandemic trying to make members of the Asian American community feel less alienated.But he concedes their efforts have fallen short. Elders frequently ask him if the pandemic is an omen of doom, a question no one can answer to any degree of satisfaction.“No one seems to care about us,” said Lee, 62.When anti-Asian violence increases, so does neglect, experts saySan Francisco’s Shanti Project, a revered nonprofit founded in the 1970s to help dying AIDS patients, expanded its services to Asian American residents of Chinatown this spring. Volunteers and staff distribute food and offer telehealth support, senior services and emergency supplies.Even before the pandemic, members of these tight-knit immigrant communities were familiar with the feeling of being neglected and overlooked. Because of this, many Asian Americans in San Francisco now cope with the belief that asking for help, whether it’s from a doctor or other service provider, is futile.Dr. Tung Nguyen, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, said the pandemic has only heightened this feeling of helplessness.Nguyen pointed out that Asian Americans are the least likely of any racial group to use health and social services. Public health officials aren’t sure whether the low usage rate is due to barriers caused by language, culture, immigration status or a general mistrust of government proposals.Nguyen also co-authored a report released in May by the Asian American Research Center on Health that called attention to the fact that 50% of San Francisco’s 31 COVID-19 deaths at that time were among Asian Americans. It was a disproportionately high percentage since Asian Americans make up just over a third of the city’s population.Although the percentage of deaths has since dropped, Nguyen said a lack of detailed data about Asian Americans often means that city funds aren’t allocated to this group.“The truth is we are the ones who lose out as a result of this stereotype,” he added.To be sure, the fortunes and contributions of many Asian Americans have skyrocketed in past decades. The median annual income of households headed by the nation’s 22 million Asian Americans is $73,060, compared with $53,600 for all U.S. households, according to the Pew Research Center.But these success stories obscure the troubling reality facing many Asian Americans.“You simply cannot look at Asian Americans as a monolithic group because if you do that, you’re going to miss how different communities experience the pandemic,” said Jarvis Chen, a lecturer in social and behavioral sciences at Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Massachusetts.A closer look at San Francisco's two dozen Asian ethnicities reveals many groups within this broad categorization are struggling financially and remain outside the mainstream. About 43% are non-English speakers, according to a USA TODAY analysis of U.S. census data. About a third of San Franciscans are foreign-born, and 13% are not U.S. citizens.Discrimination also is keeping some Asian Americans from getting tested for COVID-19.

By 1851, some 25,000 had arrived, lured by the hope of riches in a land called Gum Saan in Cantonese, or “gold mountain.”By the late 1800s, the Chinese were not just vilified but outright barred from entering the country, with few exceptions, by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. White officials charged they were taking jobs from other Americans, despite having been integral to the Gold Rush’s boom and the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad.At the height of World War II, Japanese Americans around the country were rounded up and sent to internment camps, feared as the traitorous “yellow peril” after years of citizenship. Despite painful and humiliating treatment at the hands of the U.S. government, many Asians resolved to engrain themselves in the society at large with an image of themselves as patriotic, hardworking Americans. Japanese Americans were among the most decorated U.S. soldiers during the war, and others excelled in academics and commerce.The model minority image gained momentum during the civil rights movement of the 1960s.

Many landed in San Francisco.“The stereotype about us is broad and includes the notion that we’re all studious, we don’t get into trouble and commit crimes, and even the poor don’t have health care issues,” said Ellen Wu, author of “The Color of Success: Asian Americans and the Origins of the Model Minority” and history professor at Indiana University in Bloomington. “That’s quite the change from before World War II when many of us were seen as unclean and prone to diseases.”California Assemblymember David Chiu, a Democrat who represents the eastern half of San Francisco and chairs the California Asian & Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus, said lawmakers must recognize that Asian Americans are a loosely linked group of immigrants with distinct challenges and needs.“The attention being paid to the disparities endured during the pandemic by Black and Latinos is important, but our issue hasn’t gotten the attention it deserves,” he said.One small demographic victory for Asian Americans came in 1997 when President Bill Clinton directed the Office of Management and Budget to expand its data classification system to break out “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders” from the Asian American group. That geographic list includes countries such as Micronesia, Tonga, Vanuatu, Guam, the Marshall Islands and Fiji.
As a result, we know today that Pacific Islanders rank third in terms of COVID-19 deaths, behind Native Americans and Black Americans. But many other Asians said they are largely neglected by government officials.What disappoints Marc Belocura most, he said, is that he feels ignored despite living in a part of town that city officials once highlighted as a bastion of Filipino culture.""Since the city obviously knows we are here, why is there not more outreach that is culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate?"" said Belocura, 23. ""Or maybe we just are not on their radar.""Belocura girds himself each time he prepares to leave the one-room studio he shares with his parents and sister to shop for food and supplies.Even before COVID-19, his aging neighborhood just south of Market Street was crumbling. Now more storefronts have shuttered. To avoid the homeless camps that have mushroomed across the area, Belocura walks in the street and hopes he doesn’t get hit by a car.When he makes it home, he must then navigate a narrow stairwell to get into his one-room apartment on the second floor of a five-story building.Belocura's parents, who are 71 and 60, share the lone bed. His sister, 35, and he put pillows on the floor each night. Transmission in the studio’s confines would likely be immediate.""That's why I just can't get COVID when I go out,” he said. “I can’t.”COVID-19 information hard to find in other languagesAsian American communities in San Francisco speak a range of languages including Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, Tagalog, Laotian, Samoan, Tongan, Vietnamese and Hindi. The city’s website notes that COVID-19 information is available in English, Chinese, Filipino and Spanish.Efforts by city health officials to inform Asian residents about COVID-19 safety precautions and testing in their native languages have sometimes resulted in confusing or alienating translations.For example, information about pop-up virus testing sites sometimes can come across as demands, while in other cases the language is just plain confusing.One flyer written in the Filipino language of Tagalog told people to “cover their entire face,” said Luisa Antonio, executive director of the Bayanihan Equity Center, a Filipino American support group.In another instance, an Aug. 11 health advisory issued by the city showed Tier 1 Priority were those hospitalized with symptoms, Tier 2 was anyone with symptoms or close contact with confirmed cases, and Tier 2A included a list of ethnic groups “experiencing marginalization, systemic inequity and health inequities.”Black, Latino, Native American and Pacific Islander residents were mentioned – but no other Asian groups, said Dr. Amy Tang, director of immigrant health at North East Medical Services, a health clinic that focuses on the city’s Chinese American population.“To not include other Asians among ethnic minorities who should get tested is pretty appalling,” said Tang.Department of Public Health officials declined an interview request about outreach efforts. An e-mailed response from the city’s COVID-19 Command Center offered condolences to the loved ones of those who died from COVID-19 and noted that a majority of people who died were over 60 and had underlying health conditions.In California, about 5 million of 40 million state residents are Asian American, and in three-quarters of those homes, languages other than English are spoken regularly, according to the U.S. census.Sasanna Yee, co-founder of the nonprofit Communities as One, said city officials need to pay closer attention to capturing the cultural nuances that are sometimes lost in poor translations.
Depending on how things are written, they can trigger alarm, Yee added. “Who is asking me to come out? What is this information used for? Can I trust who is asking me to do this?”Even some Asian Americans who speak fluent English said government officials have not made it easy to get information about the virus.Huiting ""Rita"" Huang grew alarmed when her mother-in-law told her that there had been a positive coronavirus case among the Chinese emigres to whom she was providing nursing services. The mother-in-law was unsure what to do and feared her poor English would make getting information about where to get tested even harder.Huang felt confident she could help. Her English was solid and she had experience getting COVID-19 information as a project coordinator and health educator for the nonprofit NICOS Chinese Health Coalition.Instead, she wound up mired in a bureaucratic doom loop. After pursuing a series of online testing-site leads through a variety of city- and community-run websites – all requiring fluency in English – Huang soon learned that there were no available appointments at testing facilities close to their neighborhood.Huang eventually found a city-run testing site near Pier 30 along San Francisco Bay. The test was negative.""That was frustrating for me, and I speak English,"" said Huang. ""I can't imagine what it would be like for someone like my mother-in-law. Well, I imagine you would simply give up on the hope of getting tested.""Some residents refuse to get testedAsian Americans in San Francisco are often left behind by city partnerships aimed at helping vulnerable populations. Efforts to increase COVID-19 testing sites largely involve Latino groups, such as Unidos En Salud. The city's various isolation and quarantine sites for the homeless and partially housed also are being used largely by the city's Latino population, with Hispanics making up 45% of those in shelters while Asians account for 7%.Asian activists and health care workers trying to fill the void said they face a population that often is wary of Western medicine, fatalistic about getting the virus, culturally averse to passing along bad news to elders and nervous about losing employment.Natalie Ah Soon, health planner with the Asian Pacific Islander Health Parity Coalition advocacy group, said some people have told her, “If God means for me to be COVID-19 positive, then OK.”Kent Woo, executive director of the NICOS Chinese Health Coalition, said residents sometimes are suspicious of health care workers when they visit local low-income buildings to talk about coronavirus safety tips.""Folks say, 'What's the point of being tested?' or 'We don't know where to go if we get infected,'"" he said. ""When we offer the option to anyone who tests positive to leave the premises and go to a hotel, they refuse.""Teams have started to be more proactive, he said, heading to single-room occupancy residences and other housing complexes before there is any rumor of a positive test. The goal is to prepare residents so they know how to respond if someone falls sick.The need is dire. Amy Dai, project coordinator for the Chinatown Community Development Center, an advocacy group that also manages low-income properties, learned that in a building she manages, 10 residents out of 30 families had tested positive.When she approached two of the residents who had come down with a fever, they assured her they couldn’t be positive because they had not left the building. A subsequent visit to a doctor confirmed they had COVID-19.If they had not waited to get tested, “it could have prevented the other infections,” said Dai.The virus has many of San Francisco’s Asian Americans living like shut-ins.Only reluctantly did Sisong Thepkaysone, 70, recently make her way from her public housing building overlooking a freeway to her doctor’s office for a routine check-up.“I’m not sure what I what I would
do if I got the virus.”
Once at the doctor’s office, an interpreter was called by phone to translate medication directions.
Thepkaysone grew upset. She expected quality medical care after the risk she had put herself
through, not a faceless voice.
“It was not a personal experience, she said. “I didn’t like it.”
Thepkaysone prefers to spend her days at home making Laotian dishes for relatives. She used to
go out to shop and visit a local Buddhist temple to give alms. But now her children shop for her
and the temple is closed. Sometimes she checks in on friends through Facebook. She watches
television, but her limited knowledge of English renders programs a pantomime.
“I’m careful,” she said. “All I know is the virus is easy to get.”
No end in sight
Rong never found out whether her daughter had COVID-19. But her days remain filled with dread.
For the past few months, the family has had little money for food or rent, which is $750 a month.
Sometimes, neighbors give them something to eat; other times she goes to the local food bank.
“We eat lots of potatoes,” she said.
It’s a far cry from the life she envisioned for herself. In Guangdong Province, Rong had a promising
job as a clothing store clerk. At the urging of her former husband’s parents, she emigrated 12
years ago to California, where she found work as a janitor to keep the family afloat. Since the
pandemic hit, she has been on unemployment insurance.
That’s left the family with no option but to remain in their Chinatown apartment. The communal
kitchen isn’t cleaned regularly. Sometimes, leaks from a floor above make their way to the shower
on the floor below. Often, the leaking fluid smells like urine.“Smell me, Mom, I’m more dirty than before I showered,” Amy Rong once told her mother.
Rong doesn’t know anyone who has contracted the virus. For her neighbors in the building,
getting tested remains a common fear.
Mostly, Rong waits for the day when the pandemic is over. For a day when it will feel safe to
venture outside. For a day when her American dream can resume.",22160
House passes measure condemning anti-Asian discrimination amid the COVID-19 pandemic,"Wu, Nicholas",USA Today,2020-09-17,"WASHINGTON – The House of Representatives passed a measure Thursday condemning anti-Asian bigotry and discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., the sponsor of the measure, told USA TODAY its passage would be “really important” to demonstrate to Asian Americans that it's “wrong to discriminate against our community in light of the pandemic.”
“We're glad that the House is taking a very strong and public stance against the discrimination and the violence that is happening during this public health crisis,” she said.
Amid inflammatory political rhetoric blaming China for the pandemic from President Donald Trump and his allies, increased numbers of Asian Americans have reported harassment and even physical assaults.
The resolution – the House’s first addressing anti-Asian discrimination related to the pandemic – passed by a 243-164 vote. All Democrats were joined by 14 Republicans in voting for the measure. Meng voted by proxy.
""The House needed to take a strong and public stand against this appalling intolerance, discrimination and violence that has taken place all across the country during this public health crisis, and today, it did just that,"" Meng said in a statement after the vote.
The resolution does not refer to any individual’s rhetoric and instead “calls on all public officials to condemn and denounce any and all anti-Asian sentiment in any form.” It asks for federal law enforcement to work with state and local officials to address reports of hate incidents and crimes against Asian American communities, as well as collect data on the incidents.
""It is something that is important, symbolic, and should be easy to stand up in defense of the Asian American community and to denounce violence,"" she said.
On the House floor, Republicans said Democrats were trying to score political points.
Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, called the resolution “just another Democrat attack on the president,"" and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called it a waste of time when the House could be working on COVID-19 relief. ""There is no kitchen in America that thinks this is a priority,"" he said.
Democrats said Republicans were more concerned about defending the president than voting to condemn hate.
""I was so dismayed to see my Republican colleagues, one after the other, come to the floor today and tell the Asian American community that their suffering does not matter and that they are indifferent to the consequences of the hate they are spreading,"" said Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., the chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the legislation would shine ""a bright light on the injustice experienced by so many, including the surge of violence and discrimination being experienced by the Asian American and Pacific Islander community.""
Many Asian Americans were ""fighting on the front lines against COVID-19,"" but ""instead of being celebrated as heroes, they are fighting violence and bigotry,"" she said.
Gregg Orton, director of the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans, a coalition of more than 35 advocacy organizations, said the vote would be a “rejection” of “COVID-19-fueled racism” and Asian Americans’ fears their concerns would be ignored.
Health experts at the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said linking diseases to a specific location or ethnicity could perpetuate stigma.
'We just want to be safe': Hate crimes, harassment of Asian Americans rise amid coronavirus pandemic
The 2020 Asian American Voter Survey released Tuesday found that 51% of Asian Americans are concerned about experiencing hate crimes, harassment and discrimination because of COVID-19, and 79% say there is a lot or some discrimination against Asian people in society.
University of Maryland Professor of American Studies Janelle Wong, co-author of several books on Asian American politics, told USA TODAY the polling showed how Asian Americans are ""still vulnerable to anti-Asian bias and racism"" despite gains in income and education.
In March, Trump wrote in a tweet that it is “very important to totally protect our Asian American community” after he faced fierce criticism from Asian American and public health advocates on his rhetoric about the coronavirus, but he still refers to it as the “China virus” amid heightened tensions with Beijing.
The House measure, a nonbinding resolution, does not require the Senate to pass it, nor does it require the president’s signature.
Meng said she hoped the measure would pass with bipartisan support and should not be controversial, but many House Republicans opposed it. Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., the second-ranking House Republican, tweeted Tuesday that Democrats were “wasting their time with the measure” and would be effectively condemning their past references to the coronavirus by its location of origin. “These people aren’t serious,” he wrote.
“This is not a waste of time. People's lives are at stake,” Meng said.
Even though it was a symbolic vote, “we shouldn’t discount the importance of the U.S. House of
Representatives, as an institution, taking a stand on this,” he said.

The country risked being on a “dangerous path where this behavior can become normalized if we do not put a stop to it now,” said John Yang, president and executive director of Asian American advocacy group Advancing Justice-AAJC.
His group, which tracks and reports hate incidents, applauded the measure and “those congressional
members who are actively trying to stop the harmful rhetoric that fans the flames of these xenophobic
attacks.”
""We must unite against racism & bigotry,"" the Leadership Conference on Human Rights, a coalition of civil
rights organizations, wrote on Twitter.
The nonprofit Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies, which promotes Asian American
political representation, wrote, ""Congress sends a message to the American people that racism, bigotry &
xenophobia will not be tolerated.""

"Black and Asian Americans report increased discrimination during pandemic, survey says. ","Ortiz, Jorge L ",USA Today,2020-07-01,"At a time of national crisis when Americans could benefit from rallying together, attitudes toward racial minorities seem to be hardening, especially when it comes to Asian and Black Americans.A study by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center released Wednesday shows that nearly 40% of Asian and Black Americans – as well as 27% of Hispanics – say they’ve had adverse experiences because of their race or ethnicity since the coronavirus outbreak began. Those experiences include hearing slurs or jokes or fearing someone may threaten or physically attack them.By contrast, only 13% of whites reported similar instances.In addition, almost 40% of U.S. adults – including 58% of the respondents of Asian descent – said it’s more common for people to express racist views about Asians than before the outbreak. And both Black Americans (42%) and Asian Americans (36%) expressed a significant degree of concern that they might arouse suspicion if they wear a mask when in stores or other businesses.That’s a particularly worrisome response considering the consensus of health experts that wearing face coverings helps curb the virus’ spread, which has led public officials in several cities and states to make them mandatory when in public.'We just want to be safe': Hate crimes, harassment of Asian Americans rise amid pandemicJohn C. Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice – AAJC, said the findings reflect the feedback his advocacy organization and others have been getting for months.The Anti-Defamation League said in mid-June that since January there has been a surge in reports of harassment and threats targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, including comments such as “Go back to China’’ and accusations of “bringing the virus’’ to the U.S.“Our community is struggling to cope with COVID-19 xenophobic attacks, and it is heartbreaking to know that both Asian and Black people have to struggle with the paradox of putting their safety at risk when they are wearing face masks to protect their health,” Yang said. “With this research report, we now have the data to show that language continuing to fan the flames of xenophobia is heightening the direct discrimination and aggression our communities face.”Some of those flames have been stoked by President Donald Trump, who early in the pandemic made repeated references to the “Chinese virus’’ – COVID-19 originated in China – and lately has taken to referring to the virus as the “kung flu.’’In a Pew survey released June 12, researchers found 48% of the general public believed Trump has made things worse when it comes to race relations, a belief shared by 68% of Black Americans and 62% of Asian Americans.Black unemployment: African Americans bear brunt of economic crisis sparked by the coronavirusZhengyu Huang, president of the Committee of 100, an organization of prominent Chinese Americans, said Asian Americans increasingly find themselves blamed for the coronavirus by people in this country who view them as foreigners, not as fellow citizens.“These threats of violence and discrimination don’t exist in a vacuum,’’ Huang said. “That is why C100 has called repeatedly on political candidates, including President Trump, to refrain from inflammatory or divisive rhetoric, deliberate fearmongering and the use of race or racially coded advertising for political gain.’’The survey released Wednesday polled 9,654 American adults and was done June 4-10, at a time of widespread protests after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis.Neil Ruiz, associate director of global migration and demography research for the Pew Research Center, said some of the responses may have been influenced by those demonstrations and the national conversation about racism they sparked.For example, although 45% of Black adults responding to the survey said it’s more common for people to express racist views against them, 51% said they have heard expressions of support.Alvin Tillery, an associate professor of political science at Northwestern University who is an expert on racial and ethnic politics, said the survey accurately represents Asian and African American communities. He added that the findings about increased hostility toward those groups are consistent with his research and what he has learned from other sources.Tillery said more information was needed to draw conclusions about the supportive statements Black Americans reported hearing amid a time of frequent protests, but he was definitive in his conclusion that some of the president’s comments amid the pandemic have contributed to the antagonism against Asians in the U.S.“While he may dismiss these statements as jokes or attacks on China, the reality is that our fellow citizens in the Asian American community are the ones who suffer at the racism that this activates in the broader public,"" Tillery said. “I know that Mr. Trump has also condemned the hate crimes against Asian Americans, but the reality is that these condemnations lose their force if he then subsequently returns to making racist jokes about it.’’More: FDA says a coronavirus vaccine would have to be at least 50% effective to be approvedThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Black and Asian Americans report increased discrimination during pandemic, survey says",5337

O.C. lifts mask order after threats to public health official, who resigned
Days after his predecessor abruptly quit, Orange County's new interim health officer lifted a requirement that residents wear face coverings in public to help slow the spread of the coronavirus.
The move comes three days after Dr. Nichole Quick quit as the county's health officer following threats at a public meeting and on social media over her order that residents wear masks in public when near others. Residents have blasted the requirement at public meetings, and the sheriff said he wouldn’t enforce it.

Reparations, and ending a ban on affirmative action?
Two legislative proposals designed to help eradicate structural inequality are making their way through the state legislature, fueled in part by large demonstrations in response to the death of George Floyd.
A proposal to establish a task force to study and prepare recommendations for how to give reparations to African Americans passed the California Assembly on Thursday.
“We seem to recognize that justice requires that those who have been treated unjustly need the means to make themselves whole again,” said Assemblywoman Shirley Weber, a Democrat from San Diego who wrote the bill.
If the bill passes the Senate and is signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom, eight people with backgrounds in racial justice reforms would lead a study into who would be eligible for compensation and how it should be awarded.
A day earlier, the Assembly passed a proposal to erase the state's 24-year ban on affirmative action. If passed by the Senate and approved by voters, it would strike from California’s Constitution the rules imposed by Proposition 209, which in 1996 prohibited government agencies and institutions from considering race, ethnicity or gender.
Affirmative action policies were initially put into place to address historical and present-day discrimination.
The two measures are among the top priorities for California's Legislative Black Caucus, which Weber heads.

Unemployment claims are down, but is that a good thing?
The news on the surface sounds good: Unemployment claims are going down and/or being denied because more people are returning to work and earning more money.
Then you dig deeper.
There, you'll see that going back to work, for many people, means taking home less than they did when they weren't working, because of the additional $600 in federal unemployment they would miss out on. And the situation is hurting already disadvantaged workers the most.
Those are some findings from UCLA's California Policy Lab's unemployment analysis released Thursday. I spoke via email to co-author Till von Wachter, the lab's faculty director and a UCLA economics professor, more about their findings and what could help.
Our conversation has been lightly edited.
Q: Let’s start with some good news. What about the numbers cheer you?
A: The fact that we see an increasing number of Californians whose UI (Unemployment Insurance) payments are being either reduced or denied altogether because they’re working is a good sign for the economy as we slowly re-open. That being said, going back to work also creates a challenging dilemma for some workers: If you’re going back to work on a reduced schedule (with reduced pay), this part-time work can result in your UI benefits being either denied or reduced.
And, of course, there’s still ongoing safety concerns for workers around COVID-19, as well as childcare issues for working parents.
Q: The brief shows how an increasing number of people are getting denied unemployment because of partial income. Is there a minimum people can earn before they’re cut off from unemployment or is it based on percentage reduction of your usual income?
When you file for unemployment insurance, EDD (The division which handles Unemployment Insurance) takes a look at your earnings history, and determines a weekly benefit amount, which is the maximum you can be paid in benefits each week.
For claimants whose amount is below the cap of $450, they can typically earn up to 75% of their prior average weekly earnings. If they earn more than that in a given week, they aren’t eligible for any benefits. But it’s week by week, so if they earn less in the next week, then they could be eligible to receive unemployment again.
Q: Your findings show one in four women, as opposed to one in five men, are affected by the crisis. Why are women impacted so much more?
Some of this, though not all, can be explained by the nature of the crisis: We’ve seen that several of the industries hardest hit by the pandemic are often the ones where more women tend to work. In particular, women make up a disproportionate share of the labor force employed in accommodation, food services and sales, industries hit especially hard by the shutdowns.
Q: I’ve heard from a lot of people that they’re making more in unemployment than working because of the extra $600 federal unemployment assistance. So should people go back to work if they can?
A: Generally speaking, yes, the Unemployment Insurance system in the U.S. is structured in such a way as to encourage people to go back to work because you’ll make more money.
That being said, policymakers created the $600 FPUC payment because they recognized the unique circumstances created by the COVID-19 crisis and all of the social distancing challenges it created, especially for the labor market.
While earning a bit of extra money during the shutdown helps many workers, the $600 payment is set to expire next month, and hence workers may return to work when they can since the risk of being unemployed and uninsured again in July may outweigh the benefits of a few weeks of extra cash now.
Q: The report suggests a program like work sharing could help workers. How does it work?
A: Work sharing programs allow firms to avoid layoffs by instead reducing hours for a group of employees. For these employees, a portion of their lost pay is replaced with prorated UI benefits. Importantly, for companies re-opening at reduced hours, work sharing allows some employees who would otherwise earn too much money in a week to remain eligible for partial UI, to instead receive these benefits, and also receive the $600 weekly FPUC payment.
Q: What else could be done to help workers and/or business owners who have been hit so hard because of this pandemic?
A: The $600 FPUC payments are a lifeline for many workers. Even with these payments, the median weekly benefit amount for initial claimants in California is just above 50% of median family income in the state. Without these additional payments, many families out of work would be facing even more severe income shocks, which will have repercussions throughout the economy as they’re forced to further reduce spending.
Tying such benefits to a meaningful economic trigger as opposed to an arbitrary calendar date should be a high priority.
Q: Anything I didn’t ask or you want to add?
A: The report also finds that close to 80% of workers who filed unemployment insurance benefits during the crisis could have received a payment. The typical UI claimant could have been paid within two weeks of filing benefits. While this may not have been true for every claimant, overall it seems the system was able to provide support for unemployed workers in a timely fashion!

The risk of invisibility,Marco della Cava,USA Today,2020-12-14,"SAN FRANCISCO – Mandy Rong was terrified her 12-year-old daughter had COVID-19. It was 2 a.m. and the young girl was hours into a fierce fever and a racking cough.""Mommy, why are my eyes on fire?"" asked Amy Rong. The mother and daughter, along with Rong's parents, live in an 80-square-foot windowless single-room-occupancy Chinatown building that is a home of last resort for many impoverished Asian immigrants. Hallways are cramped; bathrooms and kitchens are communal. A ripe setting for the spread of the highly contagious novel coronavirus.That early March night felt endless. Rong, 42, repeatedly touched Amy's forehead, wondering if her child would die in the small loft that the two shared. Down below, her father slept on the floor while her mother took the lone sofa bed.In the morning, the fever had vanished, only to return a week later. Once again, the family endured a restless night.Getting tested didn't seem like an option for the Rongs. The rumor was that the tests were expensive. Rong also feared the reaction from neighbors. ""If you test positive, everyone would be scared of you,"" she said. ""Everyone would think you are the devil.""It is easy to mistake San Francisco for a thriving Asian American haven. The city, which is its own county, boasts a bustling Chinatown, as well as a popular Japantown. Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, Vietnamese, Indians and Filipinos also have made their homes here. All told, Asians in San Francisco represent upward of 20 countries.But many Asian American immigrants in the county lead a fragile existence rendered even more precarious with the arrival of COVID-19. So far, 38% of the 167 COVID-19 deaths reported by the San Francisco Department of Public Health are Asian American residents, the most of any ethnicity.Experts also are concerned that positivity rates among Asian Americans in San Francisco could be far higher than the 13.5% reported, a byproduct of the decades-in-the-making model minority myth, which characterizes this ethnic group as financially successful, physically healthy and upwardly mobile. This belief has caused segments of the Asian American community to long be overlooked when it comes to social services for housing, employment and health.San Francisco is one of the few places in the nation tracking data on Asian Americans and COVID-19 deaths at a time when officials don't know the ethnicity of the person affected in nearly half of the nation's 16 million coronavirus cases. About 17 million Americans are of Asian descent, or 5.6% of the population.In many cases, Asian Americans in this city have received imprecise or no information in their native language about testing, safety tips, housing, and other critical care services during the pandemic. At the same time, the community is struggling with inadequate access to comprehensive health care, the need to keep front-line employment, and growing incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes.""This model minority thing, that's not us,"" said Judy Young of the Southeast Asian Development Center, a San Francisco nonprofit that helps area residents from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.""There is the language barrier, and our community is small,"" Young said. ""So the city doesn't think we have any problems, when we do.""That risk of invisibility is only heightened by the pandemic. Since city health officials do not break down COVID-19 statistics beyond ""Asian American,"" many advocates for the city's various groups said they are left to speculate about coronavirus infection and death rates within their individual communities.""There's this feeling that there's excess death out there,"" said Jeffrey Caballero of the nonprofit Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations. ""That high mortality rate among Asian Americans means either there isn't enough testing or people are waiting far too long to get care.""What is the model minority myth?For many Asian Americans in San Francisco, the high rate of COVID-19 deaths is directly linked to the corrosive and distorting effects of the model minority myth, said Dr. Tung Nguyen, a University of California, San Francisco professor of medicine.Nguyen co-wrote a report in May by the Asian American Research Center on Health that called attention to the fact that 50% of San Francisco's 31 COVID-19 deaths at that time were among Asian Americans, disproportionately high considering they make up just over a third of the population.To be sure, the fortunes and contributions of many Asian Americans have skyrocketed in past decades. The median annual income of households headed by the nation's 22 million Asian Americans is $73,060, compared with $53,600 for all U.S. households, according to the Pew Research Center.A closer look at San Francisco's two dozen Asian ethnicities reveals many groups within this broad categorization are struggling financially and remain outside the mainstream. About 43% are non-English speakers, according to a USA TODAY analysis of U.S. census data. About a third of San Franciscans are foreign-born, and 13% are not U.S. citizens.""With Asian Americans, the average always is pulled way up by those doing very well, which means you miss the groups who clearly are not,"" said Margaret Simms, a nonresident fellow with The Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., who specializes in race and labor economics.Discrimination also is keeping some Asian Americans from getting tested for COVID-19. The website Stop AAPI Hate, the acronym for Asian American Pacific Islander, has logged more than 2,500 incidents of discrimination across the U.S. since mid-March, from verbal assaults to acts of physical violence.Decades of racist policiesChinese citizens began passing through San Francisco's then bridgeless Golden Gate en masse during the Gold Rush of 1849. By the late 1800s, the Chinese were not just vilified but outright barred from the country, with few exceptions, by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. White officials charged they were taking jobs from other Americans, despite having been integral to the Gold Rush's boom and the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad.At the height of World War II, Japanese Americans around the country were rounded up and sent to internment camps, feared as the traitorous ""yellow peril"" after years of citizenship. Despite painful and humiliating treatment at the hands of the U.S. government, many Asians resolved to ingrain themselves in the society at large with an image of themselves as patriotic, hardworking Americans.The model minority image gained momentum during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Asian American success stories were highlighted by white U.S. officials both as a way of signaling to other nations, namely the Soviet Union, that America was not racist, but also to shame other ethnic groups, notably Black Americans.Then came the Vietnam War, a quagmire that resulted in a U.S.-sponsored evacuation of 125,000 refugees followed by countless others who escaped in rickety boats. Many landed in San Francisco.California Assembly member David Chiu, a Democrat who represents the eastern half of San Francisco and chairs the California Asian & Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus, said lawmakers must recognize that Asian Americans are a loosely linked group of immigrants with distinct challenges and needs.""The attention being paid to the disparities endured during the pandemic by Black and Latinos is important, but our issue hasn't gotten the attention it deserves,"" he said.A COVID-19 information gapAsian American communities in San Francisco speak a range of languages including Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, Tagalog, Laotian, Samoan, Tongan, Vietnamese, and Hindi. The city's website notes that COVID-19 information is available in English, Chinese, Filipino, and Spanish.Efforts by city health officials to inform Asian residents about COVID-19 safety precautions and testing in their native languages have sometimes resulted in confusing or alienating translations. For example, information about pop-up virus testing sites sometimes can come across as demands, while in other cases the language is just plain confusing.No end in sightRong never found out whether her daughter had COVID-19. But her days remain filled with dread. For the past few months, the family has had little money for food or rent.Rong doesn't know anyone who has contracted the virus. For her neighbors in the building, getting tested remains a common fear.Mostly, Rong waits for the day when the pandemic is over. For a day when it will feel safe to venture outside. For a day when her American dream can resume.",8618
This is America: Stop gaslighting me with the Asian 'model minority' myth,"Ryu, Jenna",USA Today,2020-12-17,"Hi everyone! Welcome to the ""This is America"" newsletter. If you don't recognize my name, no worries, because I'm new here! I'm Jenna Ryu, a Life and Travel editorial intern, and a senior at Georgetown University.It's the jolly month of December, and we're still living in a revolutionary coronavirus pandemic caused by the so-called ""China Virus,"" also known by its catchier moniker, ""Kung Flu.""Funny, right? As punny as it sounds, this wordplay (along with the incessant bat jokes) is just one example of the normalized racism that's come into the spotlight this year.Often referred to as the model minority, Asian Americans are praised for things like economic success and work ethic. The stereotypes: We're hard-working, but we don't bad-mouth the country. We economically outpace others while staying polite and reserved. We worked our way up to the American Dream without publicly voicing our struggles with prejudice, racism and discrimination along the way.It feels like these microaggressions, xenophobia and the whole model minority myth have become normalized to the point where they are overlooked. And in a year of so much reckoning – yet so much blatant racism against Asian Americans – it has reached a breaking point for Asian Americans' mental health.But first: Race and justice news we're watching
Important stories of the past week, from USA TODAY and other news sources.
Asian Americans in San Francisco are dying of COVID-19 at alarming rates: Racism is to blame
Michigan man imprisoned for nearly 4 decades exonerated after witness admits lyingI should be flattered that I'm stereotyped as ""studious,"" right?It seems like a compliment to be known as ""hard-working"" and ""good at math,"" right? Better than being referred to as a ""thug"" or ""bad hombre.""Here's the thing: The model minority myth inherently raises the standards for Asian Americans – both internally and externally. It's assumed that because of how we look and where we're from, we should all be able to achieve great feats without difficulty.I feel an immense pressure to meet ridiculously high standards that are imposed on Asians, for the fear that if I don't, I'm automatically ""dumb,"" ""disappointing"" and a ""failure."" Insecurity and self-doubt are all too familiar when others express shock that math isn't my strong suit, or that my English is surprisingly ""good"" for an Asian.Dr. Derek Iwamoto, an Asian American counseling psychologist, notes that some Asian Americans may ""crumble under the pressure"" and experience depression and anxiety when failing to meet expectations such as attending a prestigious university or becoming a successful doctor.Asian Americans are three times less likely to seek mental health services compared with their white counterparts, despite similar rates of depression and anxiety.Iwamoto attributes this not only to cultural differences, but also the model minority trope, which encourages Asians to be successful while being independent.""If you believe all Asian Americans are successful, but you're Asian with unemployment issues, you might not seek help because you feel you must be self-reliant,"" he said. ""It's hard to live up to an unrealistic notion to achieve all of these things when it's really difficult given all the barriers Asian Americans experience.""Asians are not exempt from racismSo let's talk about those ""barriers,"" as Iwamoto calls them.Assumptions that we're intelligent and successful often overshadow a reality in which our cuisines are seen as ""weird"" and ""smelly,"" or that our eye shape is considered ugly for not conforming to Eurocentric beauty standards. Worst of all, we're taught that these insensitive behaviors are less serious, and therefore more acceptable.When I've complained about those moments of harmful microaggressions, I've been told to shut up.This summer, in a trend that spanned the country, students and alumni of color at my private high school turned to Instagram to expose racism we'd experienced on campus.My voice finally felt heard when I shared my story about a dorm head who made little effort during my first year to learn my name and mistook me for another Asian girl for over a month.But my pride in sharing was soon overshadowed. The faculty member's friends and family members began invalidating my experience, questioning my authenticity and sarcastically mocking what happened and how it made me feel.Being told that the appropriate response to racism is to lighten up, laugh and stop being sensitive is a form of gaslighting. If Asian Americans are so successful, then how could these jokes about eye shape or accents actually be harmful?This year's Census Bureau data found that the percentage of Asian Americans who experienced anxiety- related issues increased from 28% to 34%, an increase of about 800,000 people.Even before the racism borne of the pandemic became common, mental health issues have been on the rise for Asian American young adults. SAMHSA's National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that the percentage of Asian Americans age 18-25 reporting serious mental health issues rose from 2.9% to 5.6% between 2008 and 2018.No matter how successful we are, we still don't belong.Sometimes, it feels like no matter how hard we work or how successful we become, Asian Americans are still just a minority that doesn't belong. It's a phenomenon Iwamoto refers to as being ""perpetual foreigners.""We all felt the sudden shift toward scapegoating Asians during the pandemic. ""Go back to China!"" ""You're all foreigners!"" It's as if the country that so proudly lauded the Oscar-winning ""Parasite"" and K-pop music suddenly forgot about our contributions.According to the 2020 Asian American Voter Survey, 51% of respondents were concerned about COVID-19- related hate crimes, and more than 79% believed that discrimination against Asian Americans is prevalent.And it's not a baseless fear: In July, an 89-year-old Asian woman was set on fire by two strangers in New York.""Harold and Kumar"" actor John Cho said it best at the start of the pandemic: ""One moment we are Americans, the next we are all foreigners.""It's time to recognize that any stereotype, no matter how positive, can turn dark in an instant. Something you laugh off could dramatically affect the mental health of its targets.

We're Americans not 'others' to abuse.,Clayton Park,USA Today,2021-03-18,"The Atlanta-area shootings where eight people were killed including six women of Asian descent hit close to home for me. At least four victims were of Korean origin. While I was born in this country and I'm proud to be an American I am half Korean and half Japanese.
It is unclear whether the shooting victims were targeted because of their race. Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said Wednesday that the suspect Robert Aaron Long 21 of Woodstock Georgia claimed that his actions weren't racially motivated and that he had a sexual addiction. 
I find it unsettling nevertheless because it comes at a time when anti-Asian sentiment and violence are on the rise in our country. Some blame people who look like me of being responsible for the so-called China virus more accurately known as the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. 
In the early months of the pandemic last year one woman on Facebook commenting on an article I wrote as business editor of The Daytona Beach News-Journal told me that I was a nothing who should go back to China. 
And I am not the only one. 
I recently interviewed a Daytona Beach Florida area family that runs a Korean restaurant. They told me they were being similarly harassed on nearly a daily basis both by people showing up in person to place orders and then refusing to pay for them as well as those calling them on the phone during their busy dinner rush.
'I'm afraid'
SaeHee Martin who owns the Chop Chop Korean Restaurant in South Daytona told me on Wednesday that she was frightened to learn about the Atlanta-area spa shootings: ""I'm afraid. I don't know what some crazy people are going to do."" 
It doesn't help that the shooter told police that he intended to drive to Florida to kill more people at spas. 
When I read the national news reports about anti-Asian hate crimes most seem to be happening in large cities that have a bigger percentage of Asian Americans. In King County Washington for example where I was born and raised those of Asian heritage account for nearly 20% of the population according to the latest Census Bureau statistics.
Here in Volusia County where Daytona Beach is located Asians account for 2% of the population. 
The Atlanta-area attacks show that anti-Asian hate crimes if in fact that's what motivated the shooter can also happen in communities where there are fewer Asians. 
In Cherokee County Georgia where the first of the three spa shootings occurred Asians account for 2.1% of the population. 
Even some people I consider friends persist in referring to COVID-19 as the China virus. When I confront them about it I am told that's where it started. True but to blame all Asians or even all Chinese for the pandemic is flat out wrong. It suggests that we are all alike as if we were the Borg from ""Star Trek."" 
Growing up in a mostly white neighborhood in Seattle I was constantly told Asians are good in math (not true for me) and not so good in English or when it came to matters involving creativity and innovation. 
I am not a stereotype
For the record I double majored in English Lit and Journalism with a minor in art. I also played for many years in rock bands and won a local songwriter contest in the Daytona Beach area a few years ago. Conversely I am not skilled in kung fu or any of the martial arts and I am not particularly adept at using chopsticks although I try. 
Alike we Asian Americans are not. 
And as far as what country I pledge my allegiance to I am as proud as any of you to be an American. 
I have an uncle who fought in World War II in not against the United States Army as a member of the highly decorated 442nd infantry unit made up of Japanese Americans. He fought the Germans while one of his brothers was interned in a relocation camp for those of Japanese descent in California. 
My wife and I have three sons all of whom have served in the U.S. military including one still in the Air Force. 
Stop viewing us as ""others."" We are Americans and we are human beings who don't deserve to be vilified or as in the apparent case of the Atlanta spa shooter objectified. 
Much less targeted.

Lawmakers to introduce anti-hate crime legislation amid rise in anti-Asian hate and violence,"Wu, Nicholas",USA Today,2021-03-11,"WASHINGTON – It has been over a year since Asian American lawmakers first sounded the alarm on a potential rise in anti-Asian hate and violence amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Since then, Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks discrimination against Asian and Pacific Island Americans, said it received more than 3,000 firsthand accounts of anti-Asian American harassment or attacks compared to roughly 100 incidents annually in previous years.In the beginning, Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., said it was ""important"" to condemn the hate incidents, even if it was ""symbolic."" But as the incidents continued to rise, ""it's time to take it to the next level to make sure that we are using all the tools in our toolbox to help curb this problem,"" she said.That includes legislation.Democratic lawmakers said they would introduce a new bill addressing a rise in hate incidents directed at Asian Americans amid the coronavirus pandemic. The bill, a revised version of legislation introduced but not passed in the last Congress, would create a new position at the Department of Justice to facilitate the review of hate crimes and provide oversight of hate crimes related to COVID-19.Meng, the lead sponsor of the legislation in the House, told USA TODAY the bill would make it ""easier for us to have a more complete and accurate picture"" of hate crimes and incidents.Among other provisions, it would issue guidance for state and local law enforcement agencies to establish their own hate crime reporting systems and education campaigns about hate crimes, provided in multiple languages.More: Hate crimes against Asian Americans are on the rise. Here's what activists, lawmakers and police are doing to stop the violenceMore: 'Stop killing us': Attacks on Asian Americans highlight rise in hate incidents amid COVID-19""We want to continue to not only raise awareness, but also to try to help find real long-term solutions,"" Meng said.Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, is spearheading the Senate's version of the legislation.""Prosecution is really important, but I think it's also important for leaders to say ... this is unacceptable and to condemn this kind of targeting of (Asian American Pacific Islanders) and in fact the targeting of any minority group to this kind of assaults and attacks,"" she said.She told USA TODAY the bill would likely pass the Democratic-controlled House, but ""we shall see"" whether it could gain traction in the Senate, where at least 10 Republicans would need to join all Democrats to block a procedural roadblock known as a filibuster.Meng believes there is ""more momentum"" this year to pass the legislation and is confident President Joe Biden's administration would be a better partner on addressing anti-Asian American hate incidents than the Trump administration.Lawmakers and advocates say the derisive language used to describe the pandemic by some politicians, including former President Donald Trump, helped inflame the anti-Asian American sentiment.""This is an administration that actually cares about this and does not go around making things worse by calling"" the coronavirus derisive names, Hirono said.Biden's administration has issued executive orders addressing the hate incidents, and lawmakers from the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, a group of lawmakers representing the interests of Asian Americans, have requested a meeting with the administration to discuss the orders' implementation, though the meeting has not yet been scheduled.Advocates have sounded the alarm on recent violent attacks against Asian Americans, including the killing of 84-year-old Thai American Vicha Ratanapakdee, and a recent increase in violence against senior citizens across the country.Although Asian American communities had been told to report hate incidents in the past, Meng said recent events made it clear to her ""obviously, that's not happening. And it's not happening at an accurate enough level.""",3916

"Atlanta spa shootings suspect charged with murder; too soon to tell if killings were racially motivated, police say","Miller, Ryan W; Estwick, Gary; Hayes, Christal",USA Today,2021-03-17,"ATLANTA – Authorities on Wednesday said a gunman suspected of killing eight people, six of whom were Asian women, at three spas may have frequented the businesses but that it was too early to determine if the shootings would be considered a hate crime.At least four of the victims of the Atlanta-area spas shootings were women of Korean descent, South Korea's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday. Two others were of Asian descent, police said.Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant said it was too soon in the investigation to say whether the shootings were a hate crime. ""We are just not there as of yet,"" Bryant said in a news conference early Wednesday.The suspect, 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long of Woodstock, Georgia, was charged with eight counts of murder Wednesday in all three shootings. Four of the counts against Long are related to shootings at two spas in Atlanta. The other four are related to shootings at a spa in Cherokee County.Long has not been charged with a hate crime, a specific charge that authorities must prove a crime was committed on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, disability or sexual orientation. He purchased a firearm Tuesday – the day of the attacks – from Big Woods Goods, a sporting goods store in Cherokee County. Matt Kilgo, the shop's attorney, said his clients are ""fully cooperating"" with police. ""Everything they have will be turned over,"" Kilgo said.Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said Wednesday that Long told authorities that his actions were not racially motivated and that he had a sex addiction.""These locations, he sees them as an outlet for him, something that he shouldn't be doing,"" Cherokee County sheriff’s Capt. Jay Baker said. ""He was attempting to take out that temptation.""All three spas are listed on Rubmaps.ch, an erotic review site that allows users to search for and review illicit massage parlors.Authorities note in the 2019 report that his parents said Long was ""not suicidal, did not take any medication, and had no mental illnesses.""Long never really made an impression in school, a former classmate said.""He was always very reserved and quiet for the most part,"" said Emily Voigt, who attended elementary, middle and high school with Long. ""Never really stood out and a lot of us (who went to school with him) never really got the chance to know him deeper because he was very shy.""Long and his father attended church most Sundays, services during the week and went on mission trips at Crabapple First Baptist Church in Alpharetta, about 30 miles north of Atlanta, Brett Cottrell, a former youth minister told the Washington Post.Elders at the church said in a statement that they were “grieved” to learn about the shooting Tuesday and are “heartbroken for all involved.”Baker said Long indicated he intended to travel to Florida to carry out similar acts at ""some type of porn industry"" there. A 9mm firearm was recovered from the suspect's car when he was arrested, Baker said.There's been a rise in anti-Asian attacks. Here's how to be an ally to the community.A visual timeline: What happened at Atlanta spa shootingsMayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said the spas in Atlanta were not on police's radar.She acknowledged that the shootings are the latest incident in a string of violence nationwide against Asian Americans amid the COVID-19 pandemic.""This is an issue that is happening across the country. It is unacceptable. It is hateful. It has to stop,"" Lance Bottoms said.In Cherokee County, the victims were identified as Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33, of Acworth; Paul Andre Michels, 54, of Atlanta; Xiaojie Tan, 49, of Kennesaw; and Daoyou Feng, 44.Four others were killed at the two Atlanta spas, but police have not yet identified them.Michels' younger brother, John Michels, 52, said he believes his brother was ""just in the wrong place at the wrong time."" He said they grew up with a total of nine siblings in Detroit, riding dirt bikes and spending summer weekends at a lake and getting into mischief together. They both served in the U.S. Army at the same time and his brother served as an infantryman in the late 1980s.""I'm the closest in age, so we were basically like twins,"" John said. ""We did everything together growing up.""John said Paul Michels owned an alarm company in Atlanta, where he and his wife, Bonnie, have lived 26 years. ""He was just a very hard-working Republican,"" John added, ""and a very strong Trump supporter.""Even in grief, John insisted on putting out a message to the alleged slayer: ""Although this is a tragedy, I forgive that man and so will Jesus Christ... I cannot hate him for it. I pray for his repentance.""What we know about the Atlanta shootings: Suspect arrested after 8 people killed at 3 spas parlorsStop AAPI Hate, a group that tracks incidents of discrimination and xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, called the incident an ""unspeakable tragedy.""""This latest attack will only exacerbate the fear and pain that the Asian American community continues to endure,"" the group said.Vice President Kamala Harris, the first African American and South Asian American woman to be elected vice president, called the incident ""tragic.""""The investigation is ongoing, we don’t yet know, we’re not yet clear about the motive.According to Stop AAPI Hate, violence against Asian Americans has sharply increased since March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic began. The group said Asian Americans have been blamed for the pandemic and connected the attacks to racist rhetoric from politicians, including former President Donald Trump.Sam Hu, a second-generation Korean American visiting Atlanta this week, spent early Wednesday morning trying to make sense of what happened.“The problem seems so insurmountable. I don’t even know where to try to begin. I think that’s why I’m so sad. It’s random, but it’s not. It’s premeditated, but it’s not. ... I’m worried because it could happen anywhere.”Hu said he believes Tuesday’s shootings are hate crimes. He wants local, state and federal officials to move fast to categorize them as such. To not do so would be the latest disservice to Asian Americans, he said.""I just couldn’t help but think that, like, that could have been me, my parents, my friends, my loved ones,"" Hu said.Stop AAPI Hate tracked nearly 3,800 incidents of hate, discrimination or attacks on Asian Americans from March 2020 through February 2021. At least 48 incidents have occurred in Georgia, the group said.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden had been briefed on the ""horrific shootings"" and administration officials have been in contact with the mayor’s office and the FBI.Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in South Korea on Wednesday morning to meet with Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong. He acknowledged the shooting and the fact that four of the victims were believed to be of Korean descent. “We are horrified by this violence which has no place in America or anywhere,” Blinken said.Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said in a tweet he appreciated law enforcement's ""quick apprehension"" of Long.""Our entire family is praying for the victims of these horrific acts of violence,"" the governor said.

Chrissy Teigen on 'heartbreaking' rise in anti-Asian attacks: 'Reach out in any way to support',"Moniuszko, Sara M.",USA Today,2021-03-26,"Chrissy Teigen is speaking up about the recent rise in anti-Asian attacks.
During an appearance on ""The Kelly Clarkson Show"" airing Friday the model and mom of two 35 said it's been ""incredible"" to see the protests taking place to bring awareness to the issue.
""I think we just came out of a long line of politicians that put a target on Asian people's backs by calling it 'the China virus'"" she told Clarkson. ""I automatically think of when my mom's without me 'How do people look at her? How do people treat her?' A lot of mothers and fathers are being targeted around the country.""
Last week eight people – most of them women of Asian descent – were killed in three shootings at Atlanta-area spas before police arrested a 21-year-old man suspected of being the gunman.
Teigen added that ""it's so obvious"" to her what the motive is in these types of attacks.
""It doesn't seem to be obvious to the politicians out there that are saying 'We're not quite sure of the motive' but I think we know what it is"" she added.

She also encouraged others to take action but not through ""performative activism.""
""If people can just reach out in any way to support the Asian-American community AAPI in general"" Teigen said. ""There's Stop AAPI Hate which is a wonderful organization to donate to and an organization called 18 Million Rising is really incredible."" 
She also encouraged people to support Asian-owned businesses in their communities.
At the beginning of the pandemic businesses especially struggled amid fears of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States including restaurants in Chinatown neighborhoods across the country.
""These things are disappearing quicker than we know it and soon they're going to be gone and it's heartbreaking to me"" she said.

For some the situation echoes a history of moments when others’ perceived racist experiences were downplayed and dismissed by detractors who called such concerns overblown or too emotional. “Those in power – and in this case those who are white and male – maintain their power partly by determining and defining what constitutes violations of these rules” said Charissa Cheah a psychology professor at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County.

Will Atlanta shootings spur action on anti-Asian hate crime laws?,"Wu, Nicholas",USA Today,2021-03-17,"WASHINGTON – Lawmakers called for action in the aftermath of a shooting in Atlanta that left at least eight people dead, the majority of whom were Asian American, raising fears among top Asian American lawmakers about the shooter's motivations amid a nationwide rise in hate incidents.Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., the chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, said the ""crimes are beyond terrifying, but it just brings home to so many Asian Americans that they are fearful of their lives and circumstances"" as they faced both the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise in hate incidents.She said her group of lawmakers met with the Department of Justice to discuss a nationwide rise in hate incidents and ""we are right now determining actions against AAPI hate."" She called for the passage of legislation to improve hate crime reporting and also for the establishment of a national day to speak out against anti-Asian American hate on March 26.And Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said the killings could spur legislation against hate crimes and for gun control. He is seeking Republican co-sponsors for legislation to create Justice Department grants aimed at improving reporting of hate crimes.“This latest series of murders in Atlanta reflects a rising surge of hate crimes, particularly now directly against Asian Americans,” Blumenthal said. “Americans should be absolutely revolted and outraged, but more importantly, do something.”House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement, ""answers are urgently needed to determine whether this deadly attack was a hate crime, and what can be done to prevent such an act from ever again happening.""“Our entire nation must come together to speak out to Stop Asian Hate,"" Pelosi said. Chu's caucus would help lead efforts to ""continue our work to end violence and bigotry in America,"" Pelosi continued.Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Asian American in the role, told reporters Wednesday that the killing ""speaks to a larger issue, which is the issue of violence in our country and what we must do to never tolerate it and to always speak out against it.”Stop AAPI Hate, an advocacy group tracking hate incidents, said it had received nearly 3,800 reports of hate incidents across the country since March 2020, compared with roughly 100 incidents annually in previous years. Advocates have sounded the alarm on recent violent attacks against Asian Americans, including the killing of 84-year-old Thai American Vicha Ratanapakdee, and a recent increase in violence against senior citizens across the country.More: Atlanta shootings suspect may have targeted massage parlors he frequented; too soon to tell if killings were racially motivated, police sayMore: Georgia killings increasing fear in Asian communities across nationCongress was set to debate the issue this week. A House panel will hold a hearing Thursday addressing the rise in anti-Asian American hate and discrimination, its first on the issue since 1987, with testimony from lawmakers and advocates including Chu. An anti-hate crime bill proposed by Chu and other lawmakers is likely to come up during the hearing as lawmakers consider their response to the rise in hate.The shootings could breathe new life into efforts to pass legislation addressing the hate incidents. Asian American lawmakers introduced legislation addressing the issue in the last Congress, but other than the House's passage of a nonbinding resolution condemning anti-Asian bigotry and discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic, no legislation was signed into law.""We stand in full and complete solidarity with our Asian American brothers and sisters throughout the country, and we will not rest until we stop Asian hate in America,"" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., a member of House Democratic leadership.Democrats have blamed much of the increase in hate incidents on former President Donald Trump, citing his use of derisive terms for the coronavirus. Trump ""clearly stoked the flames of xenophobia against AAPIs with his rhetoric,"" Chu said, and ignored warnings from advocates and lawmakers and ""doubled down"" on the rhetoric.The result was the shooting, the latest in a string of racially motivated incidents against Asians nationwide, Chu said.""It's clear the individuals were targeted because they are amongst the vulnerable in our country, immigrant Asian women,"" Chu told reporters.Local police said Wednesday that it was too soon to tell whether the killings at the massage parlors were racially motivated, saying they could have been linked to sex addiction.Yale University Sociology Department chair Grace Kao, an expert on Asian American studies, said it was hard to disentangle race from the killings.The shooter had targeted Asian American women, and given how ""Asian American women have been viewed as exotic and feminine objects in U.S. mass media and suspected of prostitution from the earliest U.S. immigration restrictions,"" the suspect could easily have viewed Asian American women in the same manner, she said.""If you talk to the average Asian American woman, most of us have been subject to varying degrees of sexual harassment that targets our gender and racial identities,"" Kao said.

Who's getting COVID blame?,"Page, Susan; Elbeshbishi, Sarah",USA Today,2021-03-22,"WASHINGTON – One in 4 Americans including nearly half of Asian Americans in recent weeks have seen someone blame Asian people for the coronavirus epidemic a new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll finds.
The nationwide survey was taken Thursday and Friday in the wake of last week's mass shooting in Georgia that killed eight people six of them women of Asian descent. Reports across the country of physical assaults and verbal abuse against Asian Americans have jumped during the yearlong pandemic.
""My friend went to the supermarket and got bullied"" said Pong Rattanakosum 45 a health care worker from Los Angeles and an American of Thai descent who was polled. When he heard about the shooting in Georgia ""I felt like anger and also anxious"" he said in a follow-up interview.
While a 57% majority of Americans describe the coronavirus pandemic as a natural disaster, 43% say they believe a particular organization or people is responsible. In response to an open-ended question, most in that group specified China, comprising nearly 1 in 4 of the total survey. 
The online poll of 1195 adults has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.
""China released it so the buck has to stop there"" said Joanne Von Prisk 78 a retired customer service manager from Sun City, Arizona who is white. ""I don't know that it was accidental or it was intentional. It should have been contained and dealt with there.""
There were sharp partisan differences in perceptions.
Partisan racial differences
Republicans were more than twice as likely as Democrats to hold a specific group or organization responsible for the pandemic. And Democrats were almost twice as likely as Republicans to report having witnessed Asian people being blamed for the pandemic in the past month.
Among the 25% of those surveyed who said they had seen someone blaming Asian people for the pandemic race and ethnicity were a divide as well: 18% of white Americans, 34% of Hispanic Americans, 40% of Black Americans and 46% of Asian Americans said they had witnessed such incidents.
""A year into the coronavirus pandemic and Americans continue to blame China for the outbreak particularly Republicans"" said Cliff Young, president of Ipsos.
An academic study published in the American Journal of Public Health last week showed the effect of then-President Donald Trump labeling the pandemic the ""Chinese virus"" during its early weeks. When he first used the hashtag #chinesevirus on Twitter in March 2020 the number of people using it exploded and they were much more likely to use explicitly anti-Asian hashtags than those who used #covid19 in tweets.
""The previous administration you know they would openly say 'Chinese virus'"" said Shirin Bhasin 44 of Milwaukee an Indian American who works in human resources. She was among those surveyed. ""So they have sort of instilled in people that it's to do with China it's to do with the Chinese people.""
Reports of violence have exposed bias against Asian Americans that has long existed but not always been recognized she said. ""It has brought more awareness and people who were just living under the rock thinking that there was no racism – some of my colleagues their eyes have opened up.""
But Bobby Colvin 74 a mango grower from Pahokee Florida who is white accuses the news media of hyping reports of attacks on Asian Americans. ""I haven't seen it"" he said. ""I don't believe it at all.""
A nonprofit group called Stop AAPI Hate reported nearly 3800 incidents of anti-Asian hate in about a year since the pandemic emerged including verbal harassment, physical assaults and civil rights violations. ""President Trump's insistence on the term 'Chinese virus' clearly stigmatized Asians as disease-carriers"" founder Russell Jeung a professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University told USA TODAY. ""Such words directed fear and anger towards Asian Americans and has led to the violence and deaths that we're grieving over.""
Changes from April 2020 to now
In an Ipsos poll last April one-third of those surveyed reported having seen Asians being blamed for the pandemic 7 points higher than in the new survey. But the change in attitudes over the past year about coming into close contact with someone of Asian descent is complicated. The number who express fear about being near someone of Asian ancestry is relatively unchanged at 21%. But the percentage concerned about being close to an Asian American who isn't wearing a mask or other protective gear rose 8 points to a 54% majority. There was no such significant shift in views in general about being close to people not wearing protective gear.",4628
Asian Americans report biggest increase in serious incidents of online hate and harassment during COVID-19 pandemic,"Guynn, Jessica; Bajak, Aleszu",USA Today,2021-03-24,"Asian Americans reported the single biggest increase in serious incidents of online hate and harassment as racist and xenophobic slurs blaming people of Asian descent for the coronavirus pandemic spread over the past year according to a new survey shared exclusively with USA TODAY. Some 17% of Asian Americans reported sexual harassment, stalking, physical threats, and other incidents, up from 11% last year. Half of them said the harassment was spurred by their race or ethnicity according to the survey from anti-hate group ADL. Overall, 21% of Asian-American respondents said they were harassed online.ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt says the survey’s findings, which come amid a growing outcry over the rapid rise in attacks on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders nationwide, show that efforts to curb surging anti-Asian sentiment by social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google's YouTube have fallen short.Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Google’s Sundar Pichai, and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey are slated to testify on Capitol Hill on Thursday about their handling of misinformation, disinformation, and other harmful content. The vast majority of those polled by ADL – 81% – agreed with the statement that social media platforms should do more to combat online hate.In a statement, Facebook said it does not allow hate speech and removes content that attacks someone for who they are, their race, ethnicity, or national origin.""Over the past year we've updated our policies to catch more implicit hate speech"" Facebook said. ""Thanks to significant investments in our technology, we proactively detect 95% of the content we remove and we continue to improve how we enforce our rules as hate speech evolves over time.""The fatal shootings of eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at Atlanta-area massage parlors have escalated concern that racist and xenophobic rants online are spilling over into real-world violence.Though police say the suspect said he did not target the women because of their race, the crime touched a nerve with the sharp increase in anti-Asian incidents in recent months. Experts say the killings were inextricably linked to racism and hate. “Hate and stigma against Asian-American populations have gone viral during the COVID-19 pandemic” said Anahi Viladrich a professor of sociology at Queens College and The Graduate Center at the City University of New York who recently published a paper in the American Journal of Public Health exploring the rise of anti-Asian language.“Social media has significantly contributed to the pandemic of prejudice and hate against Asian populations globally. With its power to freely move across time zones and social geographies, social media has turned terms such as ‘Chinese virus’ and ‘Wuhan virus' into race-based stigma against Asian groups in the United States and overseas.”Researchers at the University of California at San Francisco traced the rise of anti-Asian hashtags on Twitter to Donald Trump’s tweet in March 2020 referring to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus.” ""The use of racial and ethnic terms to describe the coronavirus is an important contributor to the record-breaking level of severe online harassment against Asian Americans over the past year"" John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children's Hospital and co-author of the study, told USA TODAY.Anti-Asian sentiment rose 85% after Trump was diagnosed with COVID-19 last fall, the ADL found at the time. Trump used the term ""China virus"" in a recent Fox News interview.Jeremy Blackburn, a professor of computer science at Binghamton University, is studying Sinophobic or anti-Chinese terms on 4chan and Twitter. What he and his colleagues witnessed was the evolution of anti-Chinese hate speech in real-time.""One slur many people are probably familiar with is ‘Wuhan Flu’ which did not exist in the lexicon until COVID-19"" he said. ""But we also found not only dozens of new slurs but more importantly that previously benign words like ‘pangolin’ were increasingly used as slurs.""Blackburn points out how difficult it is to measure the scope of the problem given how much the language has changed – even in the time since the pandemic started.""One of the major challenges in measuring Sinophobic content is that it has rapidly evolved"" he said. ""Although it is quite easy to look for occurrences of well known slurs we've seen all sorts of new Sinophobic terms arise.""Advocates for the Asian American community have warned for months that inflammatory online rhetoric about COVID-19 from political leaders, including Trump, could lead to violence.Hate crimes against Asian Americans rose 149% from 2019 to 2020 even though hate crimes overall decreased 7% during the pandemic according to findings released in early March by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University.Stop AAPI Hate, a group that tracks discrimination and xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, received nearly 3800 reports of hate incidents during the year-long pandemic.These numbers are probably a fraction of actual incidents. One in 4 Americans, including nearly half of Asian Americans in recent weeks, have seen someone blame Asian people for the coronavirus epidemic a USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll found.Recent attacks include multiple violent assaults on elderly people of Asian descent.“Racially motivated violence and other incidents against Asian Americans have reached an alarming level across the United States since the outbreak of COVID-19"" a United Nations report released last year found citing sharp rises in vandalism, physical assaults, and robberies against Asian American people, businesses, and community centers.President Joe Biden denounced the attacks as un-American in his first prime-time address. During his first week in office, Biden condemned racially motivated harassment and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and directed federal agencies to explore ways to counter the attacks.Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Tuesday that the Senate will take up legislation on anti-Asian hate crimes.The ADL survey of 2251 individuals also found:Nearly 6 in 10 African Americans reported a sharp rise in racially motivated online harassment, up from 42% last year.American adults who were harassed said they were exposed to the most harassment on Facebook the world's largest social media platform (75%), followed by Twitter (24%), Instagram which is owned by Facebook (24%), and YouTube owned by Google (21%).More than a quarter – 27% – experienced severe online harassment over the past year which includes incidents of swatting in which false police reports are made in hopes of getting a SWAT team sent to someone's home and doxing which is leaking personal information online.Overall, 41% of Americans said they had experienced some form of online hate and harassment.A third of those surveyed attributed the harassment to an identity characteristic, which was defined as sexual orientation, religion, race or ethnicity, gender identity, or disability.LGBTQ respondents reported disproportionately higher rates of harassment than all other identity groups at 64%.Twenty-eight percent of respondents say they were targeted because of their race or ethnicity.",7303
This is America: I’m still grieving the Atlanta-area spa shootings,Eve Chen,USA Today,2021-03-25,"The nation is mourning another mass shooting, the second in less than a week. But even as we grieve the 10 lives taken in Boulder, Colorado, I am still mourning those killed in the Atlanta area on March 16. Welcome to the ""This is America"" newsletter, centered on race, identity, and how they shape our lives. I’m Eve Chen, a senior video producer with the USA TODAY Network and co-chair of Gannett's Asian American employee resource group.Ask most Asian Americans and we can tell you about the times we were picked on growing up. The times kids yelled ""ching chong"" and pulled at the corners of their eyes. The times classmates made fun of our names or the unfamiliar foods we ate or the way our parents spoke. The times we were asked if we were related to literally any other Asian American at school.As adults, we’re asked where we’re from, no, where we’re really from. We’re told we speak English well even if we’ve lived here our whole lives. We’re fetishized as women or desexualized as men. We’re blamed for COVID-19, as witnessed by one in four Americans according to a USA TODAY/Ipsos poll conducted last week.Of course most people don’t mean to be racist, unconsciously centering themselves and keeping others outside. But a lifetime of microaggressions, coupled with actual violence against Asian Americans throughout the pandemic, creates cumulative trauma, which reached a tipping point with the Atlanta-area spa shootings.But first, race and justice news we're watching this week:
- Asian Americans report the biggest increase in serious incidents of online hate and harassment during the COVID pandemic.
- There's been a rise in anti-Asian attacks. Here's how to be an ally to the community.
- Jury selected in the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin charged with murder in the death of George Floyd.
- Supreme Court wrestles with complex questions of tribal power arising from a late-night traffic stop.Too close to home
The shootings hit especially close for those of us who call the Atlanta area home. My old newsroom is just blocks away from two of the spas where women who looked like me were gunned down.Whatever the stated motive or charges, my local and larger Asian American community felt attacked again.Every day for months, Asian Americans around the country have been beaten, pushed to the ground, spat on, and indeed killed. Stop AAPI Hate reported nearly 3,800 anti-Asian incidents over the past year, mostly targeting women. Asian Americans also reported the biggest increase in serious online hate and harassment incidents, according to an Anti-Defamation League survey shared exclusively with USA TODAY, with 17% reporting sexual harassment, stalking, physical threats, and more.We’ve had an entire pandemic’s worth of fear and frustrations unloaded on us. The bullies never went away.We’ve been here before
It's scary, but I refuse to live in fear in my own country.The morning after three local Asian American businesses were attacked, I went out to support three others: a restaurant, a food stall, and a grocery store. A few days later, I supported three more. After a year of enduring the dual threats of COVID-19 and racism, I wanted local business owners and workers who reminded me of my own parents years ago to know now is not the time to close their doors.From one of the largest lynchings in U.S. history, the Chinese Massacre of 1871, to the WWII internment of 120,000 Japanese Americans, to the 1982 murder of Vincent Chin, a Chinese American killed by two Detroit autoworkers who blamed industry struggles on Japan, we've faced so many hardships since Asians first arrived on U.S. shores in the 19th century.I was reminded of our resilience last week when I stopped by one of my favorite Asian American shopping centers in Duluth, Atlanta's Koreatown. Seeing the flag fly at half-staff in front of the H Mart, I remembered: We are grieving, but we are still standing and strong.Stand with us. Reach out to Asian American friends and colleagues without burdening them to share or educate you. Do the work to learn about Asian American experiences and history by reading up or watching relevant documentaries. Amplify Asian American voices and concerns and call out anti-Asian racism.

Visual timeline: What happened at Atlanta spa shootings,"Padilla, Ramon; Petras, George; Loehrke, Janet; Beard, Stephen J.",USA Today,2021-03-17,"Eight people, mostly women, were killed in three shootings within an hour of one another at spas in Atlanta on Tuesday night. A 21-year-old suspect is in custody.Six victims are Asian, four of them of Korean ethnicity, and two are white. The killings followed a recent wave of attacks against Asian Americans that coincided with the spread of the coronavirus across the United States.Georgia law enforcement officials say it’s too early in the investigation to determine if the shootings constitute a hate crime, but they have not ruled it out.Officials say the suspect, Robert Aaron Long, of Woodstock, Georgia, told them the acts were not racially motivated. Long told them he has a sexual addiction and frequently visited spas and wanted to eliminate them as a source of temptation. Authorities say they believe Long acted alone.FBI Director Christopher Wray told NPR on Thursday that the investigation continues but said, ""at the moment it does not appear that the motive was racially motivated.""However, Grace Kao, an expert on Asian American studies and the sociology department chair at Yale University, told USA TODAY it’s hard to disentangle race from the killings.Cherokee County authorities charged Long with four counts of murder and one count of assault on Wednesday. He's expected to face additional charges in Atlanta.Police arrested Long on his way to Florida, where, he told police, he intended to do “more acts.” He is being held at the Cherokee County Adult Detention Center. He waived his right to an initial court appearance on Thursday.The shootings and arrest took place in a three-hour period. Police made the arrest 150 miles from the shooting sites.Here is what happened Tuesday:4:50 p.m.
YOUNG’S ASIAN MASSAGE | Acworth, GeorgiaPolice find five people shot at the spa. Two are dead inside and two others die later at a hospital. A fifth victim, a man, remains hospitalized in stable condition.The spa is in a commercial area about 30 miles north of Atlanta.5:47 p.m.

Atlanta shootings could propel anti-hate crime bill.,Nicholas Wu,USA Today,2021-03-18,"WASHINGTON – Lawmakers called for action in the aftermath of a shooting in Atlanta that left at least eight people dead, the majority of whom were Asian American, raising fears among top Asian American lawmakers about the shooter's motivations amid a nationwide rise in hate incidents.
Rep. Judy Chu D-Calif., the chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, said the ""crimes are beyond terrifying but it just brings home to so many Asian Americans that they are fearful of their lives and circumstances"" as they faced both the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise in hate incidents. She said her group of lawmakers met with the Department of Justice to discuss a nationwide rise in hate incidents and ""we are right now determining actions against AAPI hate.""
She called for the passage of legislation to improve hate crime reporting and also for the establishment of a national day to speak out against anti-Asian American hate on March 26.
And Sen. Richard Blumenthal D-Conn. said the killings could spur legislation against hate crimes and for gun control. He is seeking Republican co-sponsors for legislation to create Justice Department grants aimed at improving reporting of hate crimes. ""This latest series of murders in Atlanta reflects a rising surge of hate crimes, particularly now directly against Asian Americans,"" Blumenthal said. ""Americans should be absolutely revolted and outraged but more importantly, do something.""
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif. said in a statement ""answers are urgently needed to determine whether this deadly attack was a hate crime and what can be done to prevent such an act from ever again happening."" Pelosi added: ""Our entire nation must come together to speak out to Stop Asian Hate.""
Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Asian American in the role, told reporters Wednesday that the killing ""speaks to a larger issue which is the issue of violence in our country and what we must do to never tolerate it.""
Stop AAPI Hate, an advocacy group tracking hate incidents, said it had received nearly 3,800 reports of hate incidents across the country since March 2020, compared with roughly 100 incidents annually in previous years. Advocates have sounded the alarm on recent violent attacks against Asian Americans, including the killing of 84-year-old Thai American Vicha Ratanapakdee, and a recent increase in violence against older people across the country.
Congress was set to debate the issue this week. A House panel will hold a hearing Thursday addressing the rise in anti-Asian American hate and discrimination, its first on the issue since 1987, with testimony from lawmakers and advocates including Chu. An anti-hate crime bill proposed by Chu and other lawmakers is likely to come up during the hearing as lawmakers consider their response to the rise in hate.
The shootings could breathe new life into efforts to pass legislation addressing the hate incidents. Asian American lawmakers introduced legislation addressing the issue in the last Congress, but other than the House's passage of a nonbinding resolution condemning anti-Asian bigotry and discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic, no legislation was signed into law.
""We stand in full and complete solidarity with our Asian American brothers and sisters throughout the country and we will not rest until we stop Asian hate in America,"" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries D-N.Y., a member of House Democratic leadership.
Democrats have blamed much of the increase in hate incidents on former President Donald Trump, citing his use of derisive terms for the coronavirus. Trump ""clearly stoked the flames of xenophobia against AAPIs with his rhetoric,"" Chu said, and ignored warnings from advocates and lawmakers. The result was the shooting, the latest in a string of racially motivated incidents against Asians nationwide, Chu said.
""It's clear the individuals were targeted because they are amongst the vulnerable in our country – immigrant Asian women,"" Chu told reporters.
Local police said Wednesday that it was too soon to tell whether the killings at the massage parlors were racially motivated, saying they could have been linked to sex addiction.
Yale University Sociology Department chair Grace Kao, an expert on Asian American studies, said it was hard to disentangle race from the killings. The shooter had targeted Asian American women and, given how ""Asian American women have been viewed as exotic and feminine objects in U.S. mass media and suspected of prostitution from the earliest U.S. immigration restrictions,"" the suspect could easily have viewed Asian American women in the same manner, she said.
""If you talk to the average Asian American woman, most of us have been subject to varying degrees of sexual harassment that targets our gender and racial identities,"" Kao said. ""They do not exist separately in the lives of individuals.""",4882
Violence and hate against Asian Americans is a health and safety crisis for everyone,Stacy Torres,USA Today,2021-03-17,"On my walks through pre-pandemic Shanghai in late September 2019, around every corner I stumbled upon everyday scenes of older people’s integration into the fabric of the city and community life.People with full heads of gray hair rode bikes and sat in front of storefronts, chatting with neighbors and eating meals from large metal bowls. An old woman whizzed by in a motorized wheelchair alongside scooters in the street. At Fuxing Park, grandpas tended to grandchildren and older men bounced spinning disks in a game of diabolo.After three days of walking around Shanghai’s teeming streets, I rested my weary feet at Jing’an Sculpture Park. An old man glanced at me writing in my notebook and struck up a conversation in English. He’d studied English in the United States and wanted to know how old I thought he was. 70, I guessed. He threw his head back and smiled. 85. He lived nearby and came to the park every day.Asian elders in America are vulnerableSuch postcards echo similar scenes in Asian neighborhoods across the United States. They remind me of older men smoking, chatting and sipping warm beverages in a plaza near San Francisco’s Japantown and a trio of elders gathered for morning calisthenics in North Beach’s Washington Square. They spark sweet memories of the elders I saw before the pandemic who danced at Portsmouth Square in Chinatown, reminding me that I’ve not danced with my hula class in a year. Many Asian American and Pacific Islander elders in my hlau modeled aging with joy, smiling as they danced through aches and pains and weathered the loss of relatives and friends.Public outings carry extra danger for Asian people, with a spate of recent attacks targeted against Asian elders that have resulted in racial trauma, injury, and death. In the Bay Area, viral videos showed the senseless killing of an 84-year-old Thai man named Vicha Ratanapakdee, thrown violently to the ground in San Francisco. Days later, another video surfaced of a 91-year-old man also shoved in Oakland’s Chinatown. Other violence against Asian elders has involved robbery, such as the ambush of a 67-year-old man in San Francisco laundromat and 75-year-old Pak Ho robbed and killed in Oakland during his morning walk last week.Volunteer escorts have sprung up to assist Asian elders, along with other DIY community safety efforts such as hiring private armed security guards and providing shopkeepers with air horns. But they aren’t a cure-all, and public safety depends on sustained government support and commitment.COVID: Forget about the frenzy over COVID-19 variants, viral evolution is normalThese attacks haven’t occurred in a vacuum but have intersected with rising violence and economic insecurity. Desolate cities and empty retail spaces from businesses that haven’t survived the COVID pandemic mean fewer “eyes on the street,” increasing danger for everyone, but especially Asian elders who may be perceived as vulnerable. Decades of structural racism and community disinvestment have exacerbated the pandemic’s acute economic devastation and increasing gun violence across the country.Russell Jeung, San Francisco State University Professor and co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, has pointed to community disinvestment in areas with Asian residents, “We live in multiracial neighborhoods with high crime rates and in these neighborhoods everybody is attacked, everybody is vulnerable...on a day to day basis in these high crime neighborhoods, pretty much every racial group is a target. We need more opportunities and more resources in these under-resourced communities like mine.”'Bullets flying by your house'Re-imagining community safety doesn’t mean flooding streets with police officers. It does mean investing in jobs, educational opportunities, health care and affordable housing that make healthy communities, and programs to promote public safety such as non-police community ambassador programs and violence reduction efforts targeted towards young people.In Oakland, pandemic closures of schools and community spaces have hampered community violence prevention programs. Recently, for the first time in a year I saw teenagers doing football drills on a gleaming new field at Fremont High School, benefiting the school’s mostly Black and brown student body. I felt safer witnessing this small but important step forward.“Even if you’re not directly impacted, having bullets flying by your house is traumatic,” says Loren Taylor, a city council member representing East Oakland. Last month I experienced this trauma during a quiet Sunday afternoon interrupted by the firecracker sound of spraying bullets across the street from my Oakland home. No one was harmed, but as I watched police officers place at least 10 yellow evidence markers near bullet casings, I worried about the Chinese grandmother who often sits with her grandson on the porch of their intergenerational home two doors down. Fortunately, she was safe.'China virus' redux: For Trump and Republicans, it's open season on Asian Americans like meRacism and violence are twin public health crises that require a response as urgent as our investment in COVID vaccine development. Living in a fortress is not a solution, nor should we expect anyone to restrict their activities and movement due to fear and racism. In this tense time we mustn’t lose sight of public acts of interracial solidarity, such as rallies against anti-Asian violence. We have a collective interest in safe public spaces and communities free from racial harm.When vandals destroyed treasured cherry blossom trees outside San Francisco’s Japanese Cultural Center in January, I reflected on how much we have already lost to hate. The community raised funds for replacements, but unless we root out the seeds of hate, we will be replanting trees and mourning lives needlessly lost for generations to come.",5864
How to stop the dangerous rise in hatred targeted at Asian Americans,"Manjusha Kulkarni, Cynthia Choi, Russell M. Jeung",USA Today,2021-03-30,"News about the deadly shooting in Atlanta broke almost one year to the day since we created the Stop AAPI Hate reporting center.
Twelve months ago our country was in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most Americans were entering their first quarantines and watching a virus spread faster than government systems could track.
But Asian Americans were watching something spread even faster than COVID-19: Widespread hate and discrimination against members of our community.
In early February even before a single COVID-19 case was recorded in Los Angeles a 12-year-old Asian American child in the city was physically assaulted in his school by a classmate who said he was a coronavirus carrier and that he should go back to China.
At the time incidents like these weren’t broadly reported. But they were widespread — they were happening to our neighbors colleagues our family members and ourselves.
We created Stop AAPI Hate so there was a way to capture the increasing attacks on our community.
One year later the vaccine provides a light at the end of the tunnel for the pandemic. But it seems there’s no end in sight for anti-Asian hate. 
In the two weeks since our country watched in horror as eight people — six of them Asian American women – were killed in Atlanta we’ve been repeatedly asked why this is occurring. Many Asian Americans do not view these shootings in a vacuum.
In the days leading up to the shooting there were what seemed to be daily reports of violent public attacks against Asian Americans — especially elderly Asian Americans — in places that included Oakland San Francisco and New York City.
The Atlanta shootings took place in fact hours after we published a report documenting nearly 3800 self-reported hate incidents from the AAPI community.
Anti-Asian hate and the scapegoating of immigrants is nothing new. But in looking through the thousands of reports that we received several things came to the fore.
Trump's rhetoric normalized hate
For one former President Donald Trump’s and other government officials’ widespread use of slurs like “Kung Flu” his anti-China rhetoric and his exploitation of existing xenophobia played a major factor in normalizing and spreading hate against Asian Americans both during the Trump administration and even now that his term is over.
Asian Americans reported hearing these slurs like “China virus” thrown at them while they were refused business harassed spit on or attacked.
There was also a devastating intersection between racism and misogyny. In our data women reported incidents 2.3 times more often than men did. The reports and stories from these women often described being sexually harassed and COVID-19 being weaponized as part of the sexual harassment.
“You Asian c---” one man yelled at Vietnamese American Hong Lee after she declined his offer of lunch last August. “What is the matter with these hoes … Help her go back to f----- Asia.”
This month we’ve also been asked about what can be done. In the shadow of the Atlanta-area shooting there is understandably a strong urge to focus on hate crime enforcement.
For example the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act authored by U.S. Sen. Mazie Hirono and U.S. Rep. Grace Meng would require a Department of Justice employee to facilitate fast reviews of federal state and local COVID-19 hate crimes for one year as well as mandate guidance to local enforcement to establish an online hate crime reporting form in multiple languages.
Certainly steps such as these can help address the lack of hate crime reporting. But the fact remains that 90% of the incidents reported to us are not hate crimes because no underlying crime was committed. Many are civil rights violations involving discrimination in the workplace restaurants and retail venues and can be prosecuted in civil court.
Multiple solutions are needed
Racism against Asian Americans is longstanding and complex and requires a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach.
We need resources dedicated to local communities including community safety programs and in-language support for those in need of mental health legal and immigration services.
We need to build a strong civil rights infrastructure at the local level by fully funding community-based groups which are often the first responders to incidents of hate.
We need to increase exposure to the voices and histories of all communities by expanding ethnic studies and education.
And finally we need stronger federal civil rights laws that address discrimination in public accommodations — businesses where we buy our groceries refill our prescriptions and eat our meals.
These solutions are neither complex nor out-of-reach.
A number of groups across the country are already moving this work forward. In Los Angeles LA vs. Hate provides direct assistance to victims of hate through a 211 reporting system for all marginalized community members.
The San Francisco-based Coalition for Community Safety and Justice focuses on victim services intervention and prevention programs community mediation and restorative justice practices.
We founded Stop AAPI Hate to not only raise awareness about anti-Asian hate but also to fight against it.
The outpouring of support and solidarity from all racial groups that has risen up in the days since this tragedy gives us every reason to be optimistic. With the energy and calls for change we are seeing now we are fundamentally hopeful that there is a true path forward in ending anti-Asian hate.

After Atlanta shootings children of Asian immigrants speak up for those who no longer can,"Mo, Jane",USA Today,2021-03-20,"My friend messaged me Wednesday saying her mom locked up her laundromat.
If you’re Asian you know a store doesn’t get locked up on any occasion — snow blizzard or Christmas.
But that day the day after a gunman took the lives of eight people six of them Asian women the doors to the laundromat were locked out of fear. 
Not much scares us.
We’re children of generations from occupied lands and wars. We’re children of immigrants nail salon techs and sandwich shop owners. 
We’re resilient. We keep our heads low work hard and rarely complain. We’ve learned to not take up space to not step on toes.
But no more.Why words matter: Biden is changing the tone after Trump's COVID rhetoricWe will not appease nor dismiss the well-camouflaged racism and xenophobia finally spewing out to the top. My generation and the generations after me will unlearn teachings of silence and accommodation our parents had to pick up to survive here. We refuse to fit into the deceivingly adorned yet inhumane mold of a model minority and a fetishized object. 
We will speak up for those who no longer can. On Tuesday six Asian women were violently murdered in Georgia. You may have seen a number but we saw our moms our grandmas and our friends in those names.Stand together to fight anti-Asian hate: We all have a stake in a more inclusive America.While the world argued away at the murderer’s exact motivation we saw the way it broke our community. While newsrooms and courtrooms tried to define a hate crime we saw security and safety being ripped away from our families. 
While you fought and debated we wept.
His name his story and his intentions are plastered everywhere but what the world didn’t see is the panicked phone calls we made to our parents. Our blank stares trying to fight back tears at work and school the next day. 
What you didn’t hear is the deep grieving and anger we aren’t used to expressing outwardly. Our words fumbling with long pauses in between because we’re learning what it means to finally take up space and be comfortable with it.
We’re resilient. We’re children of immigrants.
And we won’t be silent anymore. ",2124
Anti-Asian violence shows folly of defunding police movement,Tom Elias,USA Today,2021-03-21,"There’s an old saying about traditions: Abandon a tradition it tells us and you will soon learn why it became one.That’s what California cities are learning today as city councils around the state have acted on the urging of Black Lives Matter protesters and diverted portions of their former police budgets to social action causes in previously underserved neighborhoods.But the spate of anti-Asian violence now playing out in California communities as disparate as Sacramento San Jose Los Angeles San Leandro and Orange County dramatically shows this was folly.The logical police response to on-street attacks ought to be more foot and squad car patrols but that’s not happening in most places despite the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes. So they continue showing no signs of abating.Before the coronavirus pandemic this was not a big problem. Hate crimes against Asians were relatively few and far between. But a huge upswing began just about the time ex-President Donald Trump dubbed the coronavirus plague the “Chinese virus.”Atlanta shootings: Racism clearly drove Atlanta shootings. It also fuels sexual exploitation of Asian women.Around California these crimes have far more than doubled over the last year but no one can put a precise number on them. In San Francisco they have at least tripled. In Los Angeles there have been more than twice as many this year as a year ago. But official numbers are likely far lower than in real life partly because police don’t do much about the attacks.Not even 700-person rallies decrying the attacks like one the other day in San Jose can stop them.The head of a Southern California group called Asian-Americans Advancing Justice told one reporter many such crimes go unreported because of language problems immigrants unable to communicate with police. Plus she said “When victims … come forward having the police say nothing can be done discourages other victims from relying on police.”Some immigrant advocates also say Korean-Americans and other Asian groups are perceiving new bias among police officers perhaps caused by the Trump rhetoric.Keith Ellison and Jonathan Greenblatt: Stand together to fight anti-Asian hate. We all have a stake in a more inclusive America.But the mere presence of cops on street patrol could have stopped one early March assault on an elderly Asian man who was seated in a Nob Hill laundromat in San Francisco when at attacker ambushed him. Police presence probably would have spared the death of Vicha Ratanapakdee an 84-year-old Thai-American beaten to death in broad daylight also in San Francisco.Neither of their assailants has been identified like most others conducting the current spate of attacks.There are also less violent but still threatening incidents. One Asian-American woman stopped at a red light the other day in Fresno and a man in the next car signaled she should roll down her window. When she did he shouted “Get out of my country — that’s an order.” After pausing he reportedly added “I’ll kill you.”All this is a demonstration that even a “model minority” noted for high achievement and founding large and successful businesses of many types can suddenly be targeted especially when national leaders become loose-lipped about their own prejudices.It also shows that not only California but the entire nation needs effective policing to protect minorities who have no way to know when they might be victimized even if their particular ethnic group enjoys generally high public esteem.Because bigots have always picked on those they see as weak this is especially important for elderly and frail individuals.Yes the pandemic appears to have originated in or near the Chinese city of Wuhan. But there is no evidence it was deliberately perpetrated on the world. The claim that it was amounts to a blood libel against Chinese individuals who would have been thousands of miles away even if deeds like this had been done.Because most others have difficulty discerning Asians’ native nationalities simply from their appearance all Asian-Americans are now at serious risk especially if they don’t look strong a la the Los Angeles Angels’ 6-foot 4-inch 210 pound Shohei Otani.Police are their only assured protection from random violence and bigotry when they leave their homes. And the fewer cops on the street the more danger for them. Which is just one reason it makes little sense to defund police as Americans are now discovering.

'Absolutely disgusting and outrageous': Elderly Asian American woman released from New York hospital after brutal attack; suspect sought,"Miller, Ryan W.",USA Today,2021-03-30,"NEW YORK – A man attacked an Asian American woman in broad daylight and hurled anti-Asian insults at her as she walked down a midtown Manhattan street, New York City police said Tuesday.The woman, 65, was hospitalized with serious injuries after the attacker punched, kicked, and stomped on her Monday in front of an apartment building on 43rd Street, police said. Staff in the building did not intervene though a union representative said they called for help.In a statement, NYPD called the incident ""a hate crime assault"" and said its Hate Crime Task Force was investigating.Unsettling surveillance video shows the woman passing the building's open front doors when the attacker appears in the frame and immediately kicks her, knocking her to the ground. The man kicks and stomps on the woman multiple times before walking away.The incident occurred just before noon on Monday. NYPD released photos of the suspect Tuesday seeking tips from the public about the attack.The woman was taken to NYU Langone Hospital and was in stable condition, police said. She was discharged Tuesday evening, a hospital spokesperson said. Her name has not been released.Mayor Bill de Blasio called the incident “absolutely disgusting and outrageous” and said it was “absolutely unacceptable” that witnesses did not intervene.“I don’t care who you are, I don’t care what you do, you’ve got to help your fellow New Yorker,” de Blasio said Tuesday at a news conference. “If you see someone being attacked, do whatever you can. Make noise. Call out what’s happening. Go and try and help. Immediately call for help. Call 911. This is something where we all have to be part of the solution. We can’t just stand back and watch a heinous act happening.”Gov. Andrew Cuomo called the attack ""horrifying and repugnant"" and offered the NYPD assistance from the state police’s Hate Crimes Task Force.Police Commissioner Dermot Shea told NY1 that the attack was ""disgusting.""""I don’t know who attacks a 65-year-old woman and leaves her on the street like that,"" Shea said in an interview with the TV station.""This is absolutely vile. These attacks against Asian-American New Yorkers must end. Hate has no place here and we must always call it out when we see it,"" City Council Speaker Corey Johnson tweeted.In a statement, the Brodsky Organization, the apartment building's management company, said it suspended the staff members who did not intervene in the incident pending an investigation.""The Brodsky Organization condemns all forms of discrimination, racism, xenophobia, and violence against the Asian American community,"" the company said.In a statement, the head of the union representing the building workers disputed the allegation that they did not act and said the workers called for help immediately.“Our union is working to get further details for a more complete account and urges the public to avoid a rush to judgment while the facts are determined,” union President Kyle Bragg said.The incident follows a spike in anti-Asian hate crimes since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.More than 3,795 incidents were reported to Stop AAPI Hate from March 19, 2020, to Feb. 28, 2021. The organization said that number is “only a fraction of the number of hate incidents that actually occur.”This month, a gunman opened fire at three Atlanta-area spas, killing eight people, mostly women of Asian descent.In the wake of the shootings, donations to Asian American and Pacific Islander groups spiked. About $24 million was pledged by nearly 30 philanthropic donors, according to an Associated Press review of an analysis by the philanthropy research group Candid.",3639
Trevor Noah on Atlanta shootings: 'If that's not racism then the word has no meaning',Jenna Ryu,USA Today,2021-03-17,"Celebrities are speaking out about the latest tragedy in the Asian community.Seven women and one man, most of them of Asian descent, were killed Tuesday night in three Atlanta-area spa shootings. Two shootings were in northeast Atlanta and the third in Cherokee County. Police arrested 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long as the suspected gunman. Police said Long told authorities his actions were motivated by a sex addiction, not race, and he may have frequented some of the spas where the shootings happened.While police said Long told authorities his actions were motivated by sex addiction, many experts and top Asian American lawmakers say it's hard not to see racism inextricably tied to the killings due to a recent wave of attacks against Asian Americans that coincided with the spread of the coronavirus across the United States.Trevor Noah agrees. The ""Daily Show"" host slammed claims that the shootings weren't racially-charged on his Wednesday segment.""Your murders speak louder than your words,"" Noah said.""Don't tell me that this thing had nothing to do with race, even if the shooter said that. He thinks it had to do with his sex addiction."" he added. ""This guy blamed a specific race of people for his problems and then murdered them because of it. If that's not racism then the word has no meaning.""Trevor also criticized Cherokee County sheriff spokesperson Capt. Jay Baker who said the shooter had a ""bad day"" in a press conference Wednesday.""No, yesterday was a 'bad day' for the people who lost their lives. It's always interesting who police try and find the humanity in,"" Noah said.'Senseless and tragic': LeBron James, NBA stars speak out against Atlanta-area shootingsKim Kardashian West said ""Asians are human and deserve to be treated as such.""Her mother, Kris Jenner, added: ""I stand in solidarity with the Asian community, and with any individuals who feel attacked or marginalized because of the color of their skin. We are one world, one humanity, and one community.""John Legend said he is ""sending love to all the loved ones of those whose lives were taken.""Absolutely horrible,"" the ""All of Me"" singer wrote in response to Tuesday night's shooting. ""Our nation needs to reckon with the increased threats being directed at our Asian-American brothers and sisters.""""This escalation of attacks on Asian Americans is horrifying. STOP IT. Stop this sickness America. Stop this brutality,"" Patricia Arquette tweeted.Alyssa Milano showed her support by writing that she stands with the Asian American and Pacific Islander community, and singer Sara Bareilles described hate toward Asian Americans as ""loud,"" ""exhausting"" and ""destructive.""""The Asian hate crime tonight in Atlanta-Buckhead and Cherokee County is just so (expletive) appalling and so sad,"" Florence Pugh wrote on her Instagram story.""Everytime (sic) there's a mass shooting it's so heartbreaking and so destructive and yet America just shakes it's (sic) head as if that's just part of being in America and carries on.

Atlanta killings shatter families,"Ryan W. Miller, Trevor Hughes, Romina Ruiz-Goiriena, Jorge L. Ortiz, Jordan Culver",USA Today,2021-03-23,"ATLANTA – Most were dedicated mothers. Some came to the USA looking for a better life. One was an Army veteran working as a handyman. Some loved to dance and sing karaoke.
Authorities have identified all eight people killed last week in a string of attacks at three Atlanta-area spas. Six of the women were of Asian descent including four who were Korean.
Soon Chung Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, and Yong Ae Yue were identified Friday by the Fulton County Medical Examiner's office as the four victims of the shootings at two spas in Atlanta. The medical examiner said Park, Grant, and Yue died of gunshot wounds to the head and Kim died of gunshot wounds to the chest.
Wednesday, the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office released the names of the four victims at the spa about 30 miles north of Atlanta. Those killed at Young's Asian Massage were Delaina Ashley Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Tan, and Daoyou Feng. A 30-year-old Hispanic man was injured.
Most of the women had sons and daughters who remembered them as close friends. They dedicated their lives to making sure their children were taken care of.
Other victims included a woman who had been married less than a year and a brother who left behind more than half a dozen siblings.
The shooting came amid a spike in incidents of hate, discrimination, and violence against Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Stop AAPI Hate, a group that tracks such incidents.
Here's what we know about the victims: Hyun Jung Grant
Hyun Jung Grant, 51, loved karaoke, dancing, and clubs, and she made the world's best kimchi stew, her son Randy Park told USA TODAY.
""She dedicated her whole life to raising us but even then she found time to enjoy herself with her friends,"" Park, 22, said. ""I can't articulate or express in any way to describe what she was or what she meant to us.""
Park said he learned only recently that his mom worked in a massage parlor – she initially said it was a makeup parlor in an effort to protect her two boys.
The two Atlanta spas attacked by the shooter had been repeatedly targeted in prostitution investigations in the past 10 years, according to police records. The documents show that 10 people had been arrested on prostitution charges but none since 2013.
The suspect told police his sex addiction drove him to commit the crimes and Atlanta authorities confirmed the man had ""frequented"" the spas.
Park said he understands why his mother wasn't forthcoming and said he feels selfish and guilty for invading her privacy by asking about it. He said they never talked about her work which sometimes kept her away from home for weeks at a time.
""What's so hard about letting people live how they want? If it does no harm to you who is it harming then?"" he asked.Xiaojie Tan
Xiaojie Tan, 49, who owned Young's Asian Spa and one other in Acworth, Georgia, also went by her American name Emily. She was remembered as a curious, hardworking, and caring woman who was always filled with joy. 
""She did everything for me and for the family. She provided everything. She worked every day, 12 hours a day, so that me and our family would have a better life,"" Tan's daughter Jami Webb told USA TODAY. 
""She was full of smiles and laughter. She was just a pleasure to be around,"" said Michael Webb, Jami's father, who met Tan while traveling for work in China in the early 2000s.
Michael Webb and Tan met in her native city of Nanning, which sits on the border with Vietnam. Neither spoke the other's language well but that didn't stop the pair from falling in love.Delaina Ashley Yaun
Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33, leaves behind a 13-year-old son and 8-month-old daughter. She and her husband had been married less than a year.
Her mother Margaret Rushing told WAGA-TV that her daughter and son-in-law went to the spa on a date. When gunfire broke out, Yaun's husband locked himself in a room and wasn't injured, said Yaun's half-sister Dana Toole. 
""He's taking it hard,"" Toole said. ""He was there. He heard the gunshots and everything. You can't escape that when you're in a room and gunshots are flying – what do you do?""
""We could really use the help to cover her funeral expenses,"" loved ones said on a GoFundMe page. ""She has two beautiful babies she is leaving behind. We just don't know how to do any of this alone. If you can find it in your heart to donate, our family will certainly appreciate all of your support.""
Yaun's husband Mario Gonzalez told Spanish-language website MundoHispanico that they were getting massages in two separate rooms when the gunfire erupted. 
He said he hid in the room, and when police came, he asked repeatedly if his wife was OK. He was detained and questioned with other witnesses and did not learn until later that his wife was one of the eight victims. 
""What am I going to do?"" Gonzalez said. ""I have nothing."" Paul Andre Michels
Paul Michels, 54, owned an alarm company in Atlanta where he and his wife Bonnie lived for 26 years, his brother John said. Paul Michels had expressed interest in owning a spa and according to The Washington Post worked as a handyman at Young's Asian Spa.
John Michels said his brother was ""just in the wrong place at the wrong time."" They grew up with nine siblings in Detroit, riding dirt bikes and spending summer weekends at a lake and getting into mischief together, he said. They both served in the U.S. Army at the same time and his brother was an infantryman in the late 1980s.
""I'm the closest in age so we were basically like twins,"" said John, 52. ""We did everything together growing up.""Yong Ae Yue
Yong Ae Yue, 63, worked at the Aromatherapy Spa in Atlanta. She came to the USA from South Korea in the 1970s with her husband Mac Peterson, The New York Times reported. Citing Peterson, the newspaper said they met while he was stationed in the Army and had a son before moving to Fort Benning, Georgia, and later had another one. The couple divorced in 1982 but stayed in touch.
""She was a good mother,"" Peterson told the Times. ""She was always there for her kids.""
The organizer of a GoFundMe page that has raised nearly $64,000, who goes by the name of Robert Peterson, said he is Yue's youngest son.
""Mom was an amazing woman who loved to introduce our family and friends to her home-cooked Korean food and Korean karaoke,"" he wrote. ""Will miss joining mom on her weekly Sunday routine to the grocery store and traditional Korean dinner. She was always kind-hearted and willing to help everyone she encountered.""
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which cited Yue's two sons, said she was a licensed massage therapist who got laid off last year amid the pandemic and was happy to get back to work at the spa.Suncha Kim
Suncha Kim, 69, was a grandmother who worked at the Gold Spa across the street from Aromatherapy and liked to line dance, the Times reported. Quoting a relative who asked not to be identified, the newspaper said Kim had been married for more than 50 years and had come to the USA from South Korea seeking better educational opportunities and a better life for herself and her family.
The Washington Post reported that Kim came to the USA around 1980 and after working a number of odd jobs offered her cooking services as a volunteer to help raise funds for several organizations. Family members told the Post she made her children a priority.
On a GoFundMe page that has raised more than six times the original goal of $20,000, organizer Hillary Li thanked supporters on behalf of Kim's family: ""It brings tears to our eyes that you are all standing with us and our beloved halmoni (grandmother), mother, and wife. Suncha was such a strong loving presence in all of our lives, and we miss her so much.""Soon Chung Park
Soon Chung Park, 74, who worked at Gold Spa, moved to Atlanta after spending the majority of her life in the New York metro area.
Her son-in-law Scott Lee told the Post that after he married Park's daughter, they all lived under the same roof in Lyndhurst, New Jersey, before Park moved to Georgia. She had planned to move back in with Lee and his wife in June, he said.
Lee said Park liked to work and stay active.
""She was very healthy,"" he said. ""Everybody said she was going to live past 100 years old.""Daoyou Feng
Daoyou Feng, 44. Not much is known about Feng who, according to a friend of Xiaojie Tan's who spoke with The Washington Post, started working at Young's Asian Massage in the past few months and was kind and quiet.Elcias Hernandez-Ortiz
Elcias Hernandez-Ortiz, 30, survived the shooting and is hospitalized in intensive care. He was intubated and is set to have surgery to remove the bullet in his abdomen, his wife Flor Gonzalez told USA TODAY. She set up a GoFundMe page to help pay for medical costs where she wrote he was shot in the forehead, lungs, and stomach. 
Gonzalez told USA TODAY that her husband was on the way to a business next door to the spa where he sends money to family back home. He called her during the shooting. 
""They shot me, they shot me, come help me please,"" she said Hernandez-Ortiz begged. Those were the last words Gonzalez heard from him, she said on the verge of tears. 
The two are from San Marcos, Guatemala, an impoverished municipality in the Central American country's rugged mountains. Hernandez-Ortiz came to the USA almost a decade ago. His wife and their 9-year-old daughter joined him in Georgia in 2015. 
She said the family depends on Hernandez-Ortiz's work to survive. ""There are so many people that depend on him,"" Gonzalez said. ""I know he is strong and will come out of this for all of us."" ",9573
Asian American activists are demanding equal civil rights better education in schools after Asian hate attacks,"Ramirez, Marc",USA Today,2021-03-26,"Growing up U.S. Rep. Grace Meng remembers the slurs and name-calling she and her fellow Asian Americans occasionally endured on the playgrounds of New York.
“It was just something we grew up with” said Meng who is now in her 40s. “We were taught to mind our own business not to rock the boat. But what’s changed for my generation – even before the tragedy in Atlanta – is that people like me were starting to see people who look like their fathers and mothers and grandfathers getting beaten up. That really struck a nerve.”
Across the nation such attacks part of a rising wave of anti-Asian incidents over the past year have shocked many Asian Americans. The March 16 slaying of eight people at three Atlanta spas six of them Asian women has further sparked both a sense of heightened activism from within the Asian American community and broad-based support from beyond.
The moment seems rich with opportunity. What’s to be done with this solidarity? For Asian American community leaders and activists the answers range from creating better ballot access and greater political representation expanding Asian American history instruction in schools and emboldening activist participation from untapped groups such as youth and the greater religious community. 
“It’s really important and meaningful that we have had such widespread support from all over the country” Meng said. “As an Asian American born and raised here I have never felt that in my entire life. We need to make the most of this moment.”
Anti-Asian sentiment has grown significantly since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic with many in the community citing the disparaging rhetoric of the Trump administration as a factor. San Francisco-based Stop AAPI Hate which tracks discrimination and xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders tallied nearly 3800 such incidents from March 2020 through February 2021.
More recently results of an annual survey conducted by the Anti-Defamation League showed that Asian Americans had suffered the largest spike in severe incidents of hate and harassment online.
Throughout the United States and in Canada this weekend #StopAsianHate marches were scheduled as a response to such sentiments in places like Princeton New Jersey; Buffalo New York; Portland Maine; and Calgary Alberta.
The activism extends beyond the streets. Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth threatened Tuesday to vote against white nominees to President Joe Biden’s administration until more Asian Americans were appointed to high-ranking roles then withdrew that threat after she received assurances the White House would do better. While Vice President Kamala Harris is of Indian descent there are no Cabinet secretaries of Asian American or Pacific Islander descent in Biden's administration despite the president's pledge to reflect the nation's diversity.
This weekend U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia a member of the Congressional Black Caucus was set to host a virtual conversation for the public on anti-Asian discrimination and violence with Meng and U.S. Rep. Judy Chu of California. The event will be broadcast on Zoom and on Johnson's Facebook page.
“One of the interesting things I’ve been hearing is that this is the first time that Asian Americans have being asked to share their stories in their workplaces” said Aarti Kohli executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Asian Law Caucus a national legal advocacy group. “And people are often surprised to hear the racism that their colleagues have faced. So I'm seeing a much broader recognition of the racism that has been aimed at our community.”
Frank Wu president of Queens College City University of New York compares the moment to the mood following the 1982 killing in Detroit of Vincent Chin a Chinese American mistaken for Japanese by two struggling auto workers who beat him to death with a baseball bat. The two were eventually fined $3000 and sentenced to probation.
The resulting outrage and subsequent sense of solidarity Wu said crossed lines of ethnicity generation language and class and prompted renewed Asian American civil-rights activism. But like all movements it eventually lost momentum.
So while many Black Latino and Jewish leaders and colleagues have reached out to him in unprecedented partnership since the Atlanta killings it’s crucial Wu said to capitalize on that unity while it lasts.
“Out of this tragedy” he said “there is something I always hoped for but hadn’t seen until now: Real bridge-building intentions.""Stopping Asian hate with data and education
Making the most of the current energy was the thinking behind a “National Day of Action and Healing” a virtual conversation conducted by Chu Friday with fellow legislators activists and victims of anti-Asian attacks.
“We wanted to give people a tool to share with their co-workers their bosses their neighbors” Meng said. “We’re hopeful it can be a spark for creating long-term partnerships. That’s the immediate next step – to have this continue.”
Among the long-term solutions Meng said she’d like to see is for Americans to better understand each others’ histories and contributions – with public education being one way to do that.
“Think about what we learned in school about the contributions of Asian Americans to American history” she said. “Just a paragraph. I think we can make the most of this moment to expand the curriculum we’re teaching our kids.”
Stop AAPI Hate has likewise advocated for ethnic studies curricula as a means to curtail bullying as well as community-based violence protection programs to protect the elderly and the expansion of civil rights protections to end harassment in business.
“I look forward to seeing this movement continue to grow” said Russell Jeung the group’s co-founder and professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University.
Chu is also among those pushing two hate-related bills for Congressional approval the No Hate Act and the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act both meant to improve tracking of hate crimes.
“These are things that should have been improved a long time ago” Chu said noting that the FBI relies on individual states to submit their hate-crime data “which means that many don’t report anything. Eighteen states don’t have a mandate and three states don’t even have a hate crime statute. We need to have change there on a national basis.”Asians need more support services activists say
In Atlanta where the slayings took place the disconnect between the Asian American community and police became strikingly clear in the aftermath said Stephanie Cho executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta. Law enforcement said the shootings were not race-driven. 
“People keep wondering ‘How come people don’t trust the police?’ or ‘Why aren’t these incidents being reported?’ And it’s because we aren’t taken seriously” said Cho who has been busy juggling funerals and meeting with victims’ families. She also met with President Joe Biden who she said pledged commitment to the community beyond the crisis during his visit to Atlanta last week.
Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta called on state and local leaders last week to boost crisis-intervention resources and multilingual support across mental health legal and employment services in addition to dealing with the root causes of race-based violence and hate.
Cho hopes the momentum can ultimately be used to persuade state leaders to mandate multilingual election ballots statewide; even as of November’s election which saw Asian voter participation nearly double over 2016 the group was able to lobby just one county to print ballots in Korean she said.
Raising levels of political involvement and representation is among the goals for national Asian American leaders too.
“In light of all the things that have happened the level of frustration is almost at a boiling point with regard to representation” said Madalene Xuan-Trang Mielke executive director of the Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies which offers training for those thinking about running for municipal or state office. “Without representation in public office we aren’t at the table.”
The lack of representation in Biden’s administration has been even more galling Mielke said given Georgia’s Asian American turnout in November an increase that eclipsed Biden’s margin of victory.
Kohli of Asian Americans Advancing Justice said that while having Asian Americans in political leadership roles is important those leaders will ultimately be judged on their actions.
“The actual work that our leaders do is what will ultimately create trust in our community” said Kohli who counts among her priorities going forward ensuring that the needs of low-income Asian Americans are met. “Many Asian Americans are energized and we need to leverage that energy into social change.”
Such transformation is already underway said Russell Leong former editor of Amerasia Journal.
Younger generations of Asian Americans not affected or unaware of the Chin case are taking to the streets – and in Oakland San Francisco and New York they’re helping to provide alternatives to heavier law enforcement by accompanying elderly community pedestrians as a safety measure.
Until recent events Leong said “a lot of young people saw organizing as posting something on Instagram or Facebook. That was the extent of political organizing. But with the attacks on women and the elderly – that’s a tangible event and you have to walk the walk. That’s made a difference.”
Urging churches to stand up against white supremacy 
Meanwhile calls are growing for religious leaders to take a stand against the violence. This week the Asian American Christian Collaborative issued a strongly worded statement condemning what it described as an “evasion of responsibility” on the part of U.S. churches and denominations that it accused of perpetuating social conditions that have led to “unequal unjust and ungodly treatment and murders of racial minorities.”
The group’s statement signed by hundreds of faith leaders calls on church leaders to among other things increase representation of Asian Americans in church leadership and to commit to educational efforts to eliminate nationalism misogyny and xenophobia in their congregations. 
On Sunday the coalition is organizing simultaneous prayer rallies nationwide in a show of solidarity against hate including in Los Angeles Houston Chicago New York Baltimore and Atlanta.
“We felt like we needed to do something” said Michelle Ami Reyes the group’s vice president. “The response of the church as a whole to anti-Asian racism has been anemic.”
While Black church leaders are climbing on board she said that larger evangelical denominations including the Southern Baptist Convention or fundamentalists like Los Angeles pastor John MacArthur have been reluctant to embrace the fight against injustice or to suggest that the issue extends beyond their Asian American congregants.
""They say that if you as a Christian care about confronting systemic injustice and oppression that you’re just buying into neo-Marxist ideology and you’re a danger to the church"" Reyes said.
But it's not just largely white churches that have shied away from taking a stand said coalition president Raymond Chang. Many Asian churches he said have also refrained from activism a gesture he called at odds with their origins which saw them as centers of community and advocacy for emerging immigrant populations.
“Our focus is to get Asian American Christians engaged in activism and to see that it is not contrary to the gospel or Christian faith by any means"" Chang said. ""That’s something we’ve lost and need to recover – to be engaged with the realities of our society.”
Next month he said the coalition will hold a summit in Chicago with local Asian American and Black church leaders to discuss the common issues they face and how to combine forces.
“The Christian message is one that brings people who are divided together” Chang said. “That’s the whole message of reconciliation. But in the U.S. because our churches were established on top of a segregated society shaped by white supremacy they've never found ways to meaningfully interact with each other.”
In calling for systemic change and organizing around public hate crimes and deaths Asian American leaders said they’re taking cues from the Movement for Black Lives coalition as well as from Muslim and Asian activists who dealt with Islamophobia after 9/11 and previous generations of community leaders who sought justice for Chin after his killing.
Understanding how other communities have achieved political power is always important said Mielke of the Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies.
“We don’t do this alone"" she said. ""When we talk about what is needed it’s community-based and whatever work we’re doing to prevent this from happening to the Asian American community we’re also doing to prevent it from happening to any community.”
Georgia state senator Michelle Au who introduced bills prompted by the Atlanta killings to mandate gun safety and language-specific social services said there's an urgent need for action.
""This is the best time to take this energy and attention and turn it into something good"" she said.",13290

Since that interview, he said he has faced death threats on social media. On Sunday, Nguyen arrived at his Noodle Tree restaurant to find ""no mask,"" ""go back 2 China"" and other hateful messages scrawled in red paint on his storefront.""I was born here and I'm not Chinese,"" Nguyen, whose background is half Vietnamese and half French, told USA TODAY on Monday.

Hate crimes against Asian Americans rise,"Abdollah, Tami; Hughes, Trevor",USA Today,2021-03-05,"DENVER – Helen Oh was walking down the sidewalk of the downtown 16th Street pedestrian mall in April when two young men approached from the other direction.
The coronavirus pandemic had been spreading in the United States for a month, and Asian American community groups were warning of a disconcerting surge of hateful and racist language directed toward them, tied to the virus' origins in China. Oh, an attorney, was on her guard.
The two men drew closer.
""Infected and disgusting,"" one called out as they passed, she said.
Heart racing, she ducked into a drugstore.
""I didn't think to say anything back when I heard it,"" she said. ""It really only sunk in as I was walking away.""
Stepping back onto the street, Oh, 30, walked toward her car as an older couple approached. The woman made a show of detouring around her, she said.
""The woman literally walked off the sidewalk to be as far from me as possible,"" Oh said. ""There was no one else around and it was so obnoxious.""
One incident, she might have written off as the kind of casual racism she has encountered all her life as the daughter of Korean immigrants. But two, in such a short time? It was clear, she said, that she was being targeted because she is Asian.
""You could feel the sense of hatred and scapegoating that was being built,"" Oh said. ""I avoided going out by myself for a while.""
Asian Americans across the United States are reporting a significant increase in hate crimes, harassment and discrimination tied to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. More than a year after these attacks began, the pandemic has galvanized Asian Americans, many of whom have long felt invisible, to speak out about the hatred and racism being directed their way.
Community leaders are calling for greater enforcement of existing hate-crime laws, better connections with local police departments charged with investigating hateful incidents, and other Americans to consider the impact of their words and actions on the country's estimated 21 million Asian Americans. Asian American entertainers are using their platforms to highlight the issues, Asian American journalists are sharing their own stories of discrimination on social media and a growing chorus of federal lawmakers are demanding action.
The pandemic has especially ""struck a nerve"" for the Asian American community, which has forced many to realize that simple discrimination can turn violent, said Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California, who is a member of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. The fight against the ""bamboo ceiling"" is now also about physical safety, he said.
""For a large number of Asian Americans, especially the young generation, they're now seeing for the first time actual violence directed at them or their grandparents,"" Lieu said. ""It's highly disturbing.""
In January, President Joe Biden issued an executive order condemning the attacks – and without naming them, criticizing former President Donald Trump and other federal officials who repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as the ""China virus"" or the ""Kung flu."" The order calls for better data collection about hateful incidents, and mandates federal agencies to fight ""racism, xenophobia, and intolerance"" directed at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, or AAPI.
""The federal government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments through the actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic location of its origin,"" Biden said in his order. ""Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI persons.""
Among recent incidents: In January, an 84-year-old Thai American man was brutally shoved in San Francisco and later died. That same month, police in Oakland, California, said a young man shoved three elderly people to the ground from behind in the city's Chinatown neighborhood, knocking out one. And this week, a 36-year old Asian man in New York's Chinatown neighborhood was stabbed and taken to a hospital in critical condition. The suspect in that assault faces charges that include attempted murder as a hate crime and assault as a hate crime, among other charges, the New York Police Department said.
The surge in hate incidents against the Asian American community since the start of the pandemic was set aflame last winter when Trump began scapegoating Chinese people for the explosion of coronavirus in the United States.
""It gave a lot of people permission (to act on) their prejudice,"" said Mabel Menard, president of OCA Chicago, a chapter of OCA, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that advocates for civil rights of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
""The outrage, the decrying of these recent incidents, is because of centuries of invisibility, of feeling like the history of anti-Asian racism is not known, that what happens to our community is minimized, is overlooked,"" said Choi, of Stop AAPI Hate.
Compounding the challenge, the Asian American community is not monolithic. Instead, it's broad and encompasses people who trace their ancestry from China, Japan, the Philippines, Korea and other countries, all with their own distinct languages and cultures.
Shieh, of Asian Americans Advancing Justice of Chicago, said it's often hard to persuade victims of racial harassment or hate crimes to come to police because they speak a language other than English, or worry about their immigration status.
""We're not even a singular group that can unite,"" said Shieh, 28. ""We forget that our country is not necessarily a black-and-white paradigm or dichotomy.""
Chen, of OCA, said Asian immigrants might worry about causing ""trouble.""
""They're being targeted as Asians because they (perpetrators) don't think Asians are going to make as big as a fuss. It goes along with the stereotype that Asians are less likely to be vocal about things,"" Chen said. ""That's changing as we have more and more young people growing up here, but so long as your majority of your population is first generation, like Houston's AAPI majority they don't want to cause trouble, they just want to do their job, make a living, make sure their family is OK. They're just trying to survive.""
Lieu said Trump inflamed 'passions when he wrongfully tied Asians to COVID-19.
""It's going to take education and time to mitigate the harm that was done last year,"" Lieu said, ""It's not like you can flip a switch and people will stop engaging in discrimination.""
Oh, the Denver attorney, said the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated existing racial tensions – and the increasing violence has made it easier to speak up about them.
Oh said she became a civil rights attorney in part because she felt Chicago police never took seriously the complaints from her parents that the frequent break-ins and robberies of their small restaurant were driven by the Korean heritage.
""Feeling heard has been so powerful for the Asian community,"" she said.

Anti-Asian hashtags soared after Trump tweet,Elizabeth Weise,USA Today,2021-03-19,"The week after then-President Donald Trump first used the hashtag #chinesevirus on Twitter the number of people using the hashtag increased more than tenfold and they were much more likely to include anti-Asian hashtags than those who used #covid19 in their tweets.Anti-Asian bias and attacks have grown exponentially over the past year in conjunction with anti-Chinese rhetoric. This week's deadly shooting in Atlanta in which six of the eight people killed were of Asian descent has contributed to fears throughout the Asian-American community. Trump's use of the phrase in speeches and on Twitter which critics called racist preceded a cascade of its use by others online. The mean number of daily users in the #covid19 group rose by 379% after Trump's tweet compared with an increase of #chinesevirus by 8351%.""There were a lot of arguments that 'Chinese virus' was a scientific term and was no different than COVID-19. But in fact you see a large difference"" said Yulin Hswen a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California San Francisco.She was one of a group of researchers who tracked the number of anti-Asian hashtags that were used together with the neutral hashtag #covid19 compared with #chinesevirus. They found evidence of an association between the latter phrase and anti-Asian language. The associations show the majority of people associated #chinesevirus with negative statements and meant it to have a stigmatizing effect Hswen said. Overall half of tweets that used #chinesevirus included anti-Asian hashtags while only 20% of those that used #covid19 did according to research published Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health.The hashtags used in conjunction with #chinesevirus included expletives aimed at China Chinese people and Asians in general as well as hashtags that advocated killing Chinese people bombing Chinese cities as well as racist attacks on all things Asian. The findings come from an analysis of 1% of Twitter's real-time streaming data the week before and the week after Trump first used the hashtag on March 16 2020. Trump's tweet read ""The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries like Airlines and others that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus. We will be stronger than ever before!"" Twitter removed the tweet and Trump's entire account on Jan. 8 citing concerns that he would incite further violence after supporters rioted at the Capitol.",2459
"Hard workers, dedicated mothers, striving immigrants: These are the 8 people killed in the Atlanta area spa shootings.","Ryan W. Miller, Trevor Hughes, Romina Ruiz-Goiriena, Jorge L. Ortiz, Jordan Culver",USA Today,2021-03-19,"ATLANTA – Most were dedicated mothers. Some came to the USA looking for a better life. One was an Army veteran working as a handyman. Some loved to dance and sing karaoke.Authorities have identified all eight people killed last week in a string of attacks at three Atlanta-area spas. Six of the women were of Asian descent including four who were Korean.Soon Chung Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, and Yong Ae Yue were identified Friday by the Fulton County Medical Examiner's office as the four victims of the shootings at two spas in Atlanta.The medical examiner said Park, Grant, and Yue died of gunshot wounds to the head and Kim died of gunshot wounds to the chest.Wednesday, the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office released the names of the four victims at the spa there about 30 miles north of Atlanta. Those killed at Young’s Asian Massage were Delaina Ashley Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Tan, and Daoyou Feng. A 30-year-old Hispanic man was injured.Family and friends reflected on the lives those who were killed lived. Most of the women had sons and daughters who remembered them as close friends. They dedicated their lives to making sure their children were taken care of.Other victims included a woman who had been married less than a year and a brother who left behind more than half a dozen siblings.The shooting comes amid a spike in incidents of hate, discrimination, and violence against Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic fueled by racist rhetoric by politicians such as former President Donald Trump, said Stop AAPI Hate, a group that tracks such incidents.Who gets to decide what is racism, hate? Atlanta shootings renew debate over white violence, privilege.Here's what we know about the victims:Hyun Jung GrantHyun Jung Grant, 51, loved karaoke, dancing, and clubs, and she made the world's best kimchi stew, her son Randy Park told USA TODAY.""She dedicated her whole life to raising us but even then she found time to enjoy herself with her friends,"" Park, 22, said. ""I can't articulate or express in any way to describe what she was or what she meant to us. I could say whatever word that comes to my head for her but it doesn't encompass a fraction of what she meant to us.""Park said he learned only recently that his mom worked in a massage parlor – she initially said it was a makeup parlor in an effort to protect her two boys.The two Atlanta spas attacked by the shooter had been repeatedly targeted in prostitution investigations in the past 10 years, according to police records. The documents show that 10 people had been arrested on prostitution charges but none since 2013.The suspect told police his sex addiction drove him to commit the crimes and Atlanta authorities confirmed the man had ""frequented"" the spas.Park said he understands why his mother wasn't forthcoming and said he feels selfish and guilty for invading her privacy by asking about it. He said they never talked about her work, which sometimes kept her away from home for weeks at a time.""What's so hard about letting people live how they want? If it does no harm to you, who is it harming then?"" he asked.Business owner, Army veteran, woman on a date: More on the victims of the deadly rampage through 3 spas in Georgia.Xiaojie TanXiaojie Tan, 49, who owned Young's Asian Spa and one other in Acworth, Georgia, also went by her American name Emily. She was remembered as a curious, hardworking, and caring woman who was always filled with joy.“She did everything for me and for the family. She provided everything. She worked every day, 12 hours a day, so that me and our family would have a better life,” Tan's daughter Jami Webb told USA TODAY.""She was full of smiles and laughter. She was just a pleasure to be around,” said Michael Webb, Jami's father, who met Tan while traveling for work in China in the early 2000s.Tan was the youngest of two girls born to parents who were Catholics in the communist country. Her dad fixed bicycles.Michael Webb and Tan met in her native city of Nanning, China, which sits on the border with Vietnam. Neither spoke the other’s language well, but that didn’t stop the pair from falling in love.Some called her by her Chinese name Xiaojie, or Jay for short. In China, it is customary to put the family name before the given name and Tan's name in Chinese transliterated to Tan Xiao Jie, which means pure or honest. Because Western countries use the surname last, her legal name in the USA was Xiaojie Tan.Xiaojie Tan dreamed of traveling the world and celebrating her 50th birthday with her daughter. Then the Atlanta shooter ended her life.Delaina Ashley YaunDelaina Ashley Yaun, 33, leaves behind a 13-year-old son and 8-month-old daughter. She and her husband had been married less than a year.Her mother Margaret Rushing told WAGA-TV that her daughter and son-in-law went to the spa on a date. When gunfire broke out, Yaun's husband locked himself in a room and wasn't injured, said Yaun's half-sister Dana Toole.“He’s taking it hard,” Toole said. “He was there. He heard the gunshots and everything. You can’t escape that when you’re in a room and gunshots are flying – what do you do?”""We could really use the help to cover her funeral expenses,"" loved ones said on a GoFundMe page. ""She has two beautiful babies she is leaving behind. We just don't know how to do any of this alone. If you can find it in your heart to donate, our Family will certainly appreciate all of your support.""Yaun's husband Mario González told Spanish-language website MundoHispanico that they were getting massages in two separate rooms when the gunfire erupted.He said he hid in the room and when police came, he asked repeatedly if his wife was OK. He was detained and questioned with other witnesses and did not learn until later that his wife was one of the eight victims.""What am I going to do?"" González said, adding that the shooting has left their 8-month-old infant without a mother. ""I have nothing.""Paul Andre MichelsPaul Michels, 54, owned an alarm company in Atlanta where he and his wife Bonnie lived for 26 years, his brother John said. Paul Michels had expressed interest in owning a spa and according to The Washington Post, worked as a handyman at Young's Asian Spa in recent months.John Michels said his brother was ""just in the wrong place at the wrong time."" They grew up with nine siblings in Detroit, riding dirt bikes and spending summer weekends at a lake and getting into mischief together, he said. They both served in the U.S. Army at the same time and his brother was an infantryman in the late 1980s.""I'm the closest in age so we were basically like twins,"" said John, 52. ""We did everything together growing up.""Yong Ae YueYong Ae Yue, 63, worked at the Aromatherapy Spa in Atlanta. She came to the USA from South Korea in the 1970s with her husband, Mac Peterson, The New York Times reported. Citing Peterson, the newspaper said they met while he was stationed in the Army and had a son before moving to Fort Benning, Georgia, and later had another one. The couple divorced in 1982 but stayed in touch.""She was a good mother,'' Peterson told the Times. ""She was always there for her kids.''The organizer of a GoFundMe page that has raised nearly $64,000 who goes by the name of Robert Peterson said he is Yue's youngest son.""Mom was an amazing woman who loved to introduce our family and friends to her home-cooked Korean food and Korean karaoke,"" he wrote. ""Will miss joining mom on her weekly Sunday routine to the grocery store and traditional Korean dinner. She was always kind-hearted and willing to help everyone she encountered.''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which cited Yue's two sons, said she was a licensed massage therapist who got laid off last year amid the pandemic and was happy to get back to work at the spa.Suncha KimSuncha Kim, 69, was a grandmother who worked at the Gold Spa across the street from Aromatherapy and liked to line dance, the Times reported. Quoting a relative who asked not to be identified, the newspaper said Kim had been married for more than 50 years and had come to the USA from South Korea seeking better educational opportunities and a better life for herself and her family.The Washington Post reported that Kim came to the USA around 1980 and after working a number of odd jobs offered her cooking services as a volunteer to help raise funds for several organizations. Family members told the Post she made her children a priority.On a GoFundMe page that has raised more than six times the original goal of $20,000, organizer Hillary Li thanked supporters on behalf of Kim's family: ""It brings tears to our eyes that you are all standing with us and our beloved halmoni (grandmother), mother, and wife. Suncha was such a strong loving presence in all of our lives and we miss her so much.""Soon Chung ParkSoon Chung Park, 74, who worked at Gold Spa, moved to Atlanta after spending the majority of her life in the New York metro area.Her son-in-law Scott Lee told the Post that after he married Park's daughter, they all lived under the same roof in Lyndhurst, New Jersey before Park moved to Georgia. She had planned to move back in with Lee and his wife in June, he said.Lee said Park liked to work and stay active.“She was very healthy,” he said. “Everybody said she was going to live past 100 years old.”Daoyou FengDaoyou Feng, 44. Not much is known about Feng who, according to a friend of Xiaojie Tan's who spoke with The Washington Post, started working at Young’s Asian Massage in the past few months and was kind and quiet.Elcias Hernandez-OrtizElcias Hernandez-Ortiz, 30, survived the shooting and is hospitalized in intensive care. He was intubated and is set to have surgery as early as next week to remove the bullet in his abdomen, his wife Flor Gonzalez told USA TODAY. She set up a GoFundMe page to help pay for medical costs where she wrote he was shot in the forehead, lungs, and stomach.Gonzalez told USA TODAY that her husband was on the way to a business next door to the spa where he sends money to family back home. He called her during the shooting.“They shot me, they shot me, come help me please,” she said Hernandez-Ortiz begged. Those were the last words Gonzalez heard from him, she said, on the verge of tears.The two are from San Marcos, Guatemala, an impoverished municipality in the Central American country’s rugged mountains. Hernandez-Ortiz came to the USA almost a decade ago. His wife and their 9-year-old daughter joined him in Georgia in 2015.She said the family depends on Hernandez-Ortiz’s work to survive.“There are so many people that depend on him,” Gonzalez said. “I know he is strong and will come out of this for all of us.”",10696
Rally decries anti-Asian violence mourns victims,"Ramirez, Marc; Hughes, Trevor",USA Today,2021-03-22,"ATLANTA – As people nationwide rallied in support of the nation's Asian American community after last week's killings in Georgia, hundreds gathered over the weekend in downtown Atlanta for a rally and march to honor the victims and decry anti-Asian violence.'My mother can rest easy'A GoFundMe account for the sons of shooting victim Hyun Jung Grant has raised millions of dollars.""We have been invisible and ignored in our country for over a century,"" New York City-based actor Will Lex Ham told the crowd on Saturday. ""We are getting violently physically attacked. It took an elderly man in San Francisco to die to get attention. It took six Asian women to die in Atlanta to get people to care.""Eight people were killed in Tuesday's rampage, six of them Asian women. Though police say the suspect said he did not target them because of their race, the crime touched a nerve in a community already reeling from a yearlong rise in anti-Asian incidents that has spiked in recent months.The crowd in Atlanta gathered near the State Capitol, many holding signs reading ""Stop Asian Hate"" as Ham, among the event's organizers, led them in a chant of ""Stand up fight back!""Gaby Lynch, 32, carried a piece of cardboard that read ""Does this sign make me look submissive?""The daughter of a Filipino man and a Korean-Japanese-Irish mother, Lynch said the event was her first rally, and she was heartened to see the community support.""It feels like home – like we are surrounded by family members,"" said Lynch, who works in wholesaling in Atlanta. ""We need people to know that we are not just silent and quiet.""Newly elected Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., offered his support to the crowd and promised to use his position to fight discrimination, racism, and gun violence.The tragedy has prompted an outpouring of support as communities nationwide from Phoenix to Philadelphia gathered to mourn the dead. A coalition called the Asian American Leaders Table had compiled a list of such events around the country, some of them planned over the weekend or later this month.Video shows suspect at spaSurveillance video released Friday shows the suspect in the killings leaving the spa where the first shootings are believed to have taken place.The video obtained by the Associated Press shows 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long leaving Young's Asian Massage in Acworth, Georgia, 30 minutes north of Atlanta, and getting into his vehicle.Four people were shot to death there and another person wounded. Four others were killed at two other spas in the Atlanta area.Other video footage obtained by the Washington Post indicates Long spent an hour outside Young's before entering the spa. An hour and 12 minutes later, he is seen leaving the location and getting into his car before police arrive, the newspaper said.More details about the suspect have been emerging. Records released to USA TODAY on Friday indicated that Long had been kicked out of his parents' home the day before the shooting and was ""emotional.""Long also had recently been furloughed from his job at a trade show business because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the report said.Police have said Long had indicated he committed the shootings because of a sex addiction.Spas had been targets of stingsPolice records showed officers had targeted two of the spas numerous times over the past decade in prostitution stings, appearing to contradict Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms' statement last week that aside from a minor potential theft, the businesses had not been a police concern.Federal investigators have not found evidence that clears the high bar for federal hate crime charges against Long, the AP reported, citing two law enforcement officials.Nevertheless, experts have said the killings are inextricably connected to racism and hate. The shootings come during a spike in incidents of hate, discrimination, and violence against Asian Americans amid the COVID-19 pandemic fueled by politicians' racist rhetoric, said Stop AAPI Hate, a group that tracks such incidents. AAPI stands for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.Those killed Tuesday were Soon Chung Park, 74; Hyun Jung Grant, 51; Suncha Kim, 69; Yong Ae Yue, 63; Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Daoyou Feng, 44; and Xiaojie Tan, 49, who owned Young's.Outrage across the countryThe events Tuesday began late that afternoon when authorities say Long opened fire at Young's before driving 30 miles into Atlanta and killing four more people at two businesses, Gold Spa and Aromatherapy Spa. Police believe he was headed to Florida where he meant to target additional spas when he was arrested about 150 miles south of Atlanta.Reverberations from the incident are being felt throughout the country, especially among Asian Americans who feel a sense of vulnerability and are fearful of heading out amid the spike in anti-Asian incidents. In a report released last week before the Atlanta killings, Stop AAPI Hate said it recorded nearly 3,800 anti-Asian incidents – including harassment, discrimination, and acts of violence – from mid-March last year to late February 2021.Kay Kim, a longtime resident of Savannah who attends a local Asian church, said her whole congregation is scared. In conversation, she oscillates between anxiety about the violence and faith that the world is still beautiful.""It's senseless,"" Kim said. ""It doesn't have to be this way. It's a beautiful America, a blessed country. We shouldn't ruin it with these kinds of acts.""",5468
'Outrageous': New York man hospitalized in critical condition after latest anti-Asian attack,"Ortiz, Jorge L.",USA Today,2021-04-25,"A 61-year-old Chinese American man who was the victim of what was called an ""outrageous"" assault was in critical but stable condition Sunday in a New York hospital.Police said the man was collecting cans in East Harlem on Friday night when he was attacked from behind knocked to the ground and repeatedly kicked in the head. Surveillance video released by police appears to show the attacker stomping on the man's head.It was the latest instance in a troubling spike in attacks against Asian people across the country believed to stem mainly from misguided anger about the coronavirus pandemic which originated in China.In late March a 65-year-old Asian American woman was hospitalized with serious injuries after a man punched kicked and stomped on her while uttering anti-Asian insults in a Manhattan street. Similar incidents have been documented in other cities especially those with large Asian populations such as San Francisco and Oakland California.In March the organization Stop AAPI Hate—founded last year in response to the increased targeting of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders during the pandemic—said it had received reports of nearly 3800 hate incidents in a year and estimated that was only a fraction of the actual number.Former President Donald Trump frequently referred to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" or the ""kung flu"" drawing widespread criticism for the terms' racial connotations.Last week the U.S. Senate passed legislation aimed at fighting the rise in hate crimes against members of the AAPI community.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the latest attack was ""outrageous"" and vowed to take action against the assailant who remains at large.""Make no mistake we will find the perpetrator and they will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law"" de Blasio tweeted.The police department's hate crimes task force is investigating and Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday that he would direct the state hate crimes task force to offer assistance.""I'm sickened to learn of yet another bigoted act of violence against an Asian American man"" the governor said in a statement. ""This is not who we are as New Yorkers and we will not let these cowardly acts of hate against members of our New York family intimidate us.""Police did not release the victim's name but multiple news outlets identified him as Yao Pan Ma a former restaurant worker who lost his job because of the pandemic and was trying to make money by collecting cans.",2465

The registry is set up in the form of a GoFundMe with The Knot Registry to receive donations to go toward the organization.Last month eight people most of them women of Asian descent were killed in three shootings at Atlanta-area spas before police arrested a 21-year-old man suspected of being the gunman. And in New York City police have arrested a man for allegedly punching kicking stomping and hurling anti-Asian insults at an Asian American woman in broad daylight Monday as she walked down the street. The recent incidents sparked public attention about the rise in attacks against Asian Americans amid the spread of coronavirus.In an interview with The Knot Mai who is Asian American and whose parents immigrated from Vietnam said her relationship with Jeezy who is Black is bonded in part by the passion they share to give back to their communities.""It's not just the recent events that make me mindful about our distinct cultures for Jeezy everything from his upbringing experiences struggles and his position in this white-centric country - is a learning curve for me; and vice versa"" she said.Many celebrities like Trevor Noah Olivia Munn and Ken Jeong have used their platforms to speak out against anti-Asian hate and to donate in support of the Asian community. In February Mai told USA TODAY about feeling ""sickened to (her) stomach"" when she thinks about the rise in recent attacks against Asian Americans.More: Trevor Noah on Atlanta shootings: 'If that's not racism then the word has no meaning'""I'm sickened to my stomach and filled with so much anger and pain just when we're already aware of racist attacks and our systemic racism that spawns across the world and especially in our country for our Black brothers and sisters"" Mai said.

Olympic hopefuls say they've experienced anti-Asian hate.,Nancy Armour,USA Today,2021-04-07,"Not even athletes who represent the United States are spared the anti-Asian hate that has become so prevalent throughout the country.Sakura Kokumai, who has qualified for the Tokyo Olympics in karate, and Yul Moldauer, a favorite to make the men's gymnastics team, both said Wednesday they have been the targets of racism in recent weeks. Kokumai was born in Japan and Moldauer was adopted from South Korea as a baby.""I'm not trying to get anyone to say sorry or the pity or anything towards me,"" Moldauer said during the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee's media summit. ""I'm just trying to bring awareness for everyone because I know I have a platform and I can use it.""Hate crimes and attacks on Asians and Asian-Americans have ""significantly increased"" since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic according to the Anti-Defamation League. Former President Donald Trump's inflammatory rhetoric - he blamed China for the virus and used slurs to describe the pandemic - contributed to the rise in anti-Asian racism according to an ADL study published last month.""The spike in physical violence against Asian-Americans across the nation was whipped up in large part by bigotry and conspiracy theories that grew online fanned by national leaders"" including Trump, the ADL said.""What happened to me was nothing compared to what we see on social media right now -- people getting hit, people get slashed, people getting killed,"" said Kokumai, who said she was verbally harassed and called racial slurs while she was training about a week ago.""We are in a way being targeted (by this) violence and harassment and discrimination,"" she added.

'No room for hate': California man faces multiple charges for allegedly throwing rocks at Asian American woman 6-year-old son,"Hayes, Christal",USA Today,2021-04-06,"A man who allegedly threw rocks at an Asian woman and her 6-year-old son in the Los Angeles area was charged with a hate crime Monday, the latest in a string of attacks targeting Asian Americans.Roger Janke, 28, faces several charges including violating civil rights, throwing a substance at a vehicle, and a hate crime, according to the Orange County District Attorney's office.Janke is accused of throwing two rocks at the woman and her son while they were driving in Fullerton, about 25 miles southeast of Los Angeles. The rocks cracked the windshield of the woman's Tesla and damaged her bumper, the DA's office said in a press release.The woman drove to a nearby park and called authorities.""I refuse to tolerate hate in Orange County,"" District Attorney Todd Spitzer said in a statement. ""A woman and her child should be able to drive down the street without worrying about being attacked because of the color of their skin.""Spitzer vowed to prosecute the case and others like it to the fullest extent to send a message: ""There is no room for hate here or anywhere.""Janke, who told police that ""Koreans in the area were trying to control him,"" according to the release, pleaded not guilty. The Fullerton man faces a maximum sentence of six years in prison.The incident is the latest in a disturbing surge of hate crimes targeting Asian Americans since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly 3,800 incidents were reported to Stop AAPI Hate, a San Francisco-based organization that tracks discrimination and xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The group said those reported incidents are ""only a fraction"" of the number that actually occur.Recent attacks include an Asian American woman brutally assaulted in the middle of the day outside a luxury apartment building in New York City and an elderly Asian American woman who fought off a man who hit her on a San Francisco street.The incidents have rattled the AAPI community, with some considering leaving areas like San Francisco where there have been a number of unprovoked attacks. The concerns hit a peak last month after eight people were shot and killed at three spas in Georgia. Six of the victims were women of Asian descent, though authorities have not said the shooting was motivated by race.In the aftermath of the attack, demonstrators took to the streets in major cities nationwide, including New York, Washington, Chicago, and San Francisco, to protest the wave of violence.The attacks against Asian Americans haven't just been physical.",2535

Chicago man charged with attempted murder after police say he drove his truck into a picnic,Christine Fernando,USA Today,2021-05-04,"A Chicago man was charged with attempted murder after allegedly driving his car into a picnic according to police. Witnesses said the man also made anti-Asian comments during the incident according to local news outlets.Timothy Nielsen 57 was arrested Saturday and faces charges of four counts of attempted murder after he ""intentionally jumped a curb in his vehicle and drove at a group of pedestrians gathered for a picnic"" according to the Chicago Police Department.Police said Nielsen struck a 42-year-old woman with his truck before she was briefly trapped underneath the vehicle. The woman who was seriously injured was transported to a nearby hospital and was treated for ""lacerations and other injuries and has since been released"" according to the police department.Nielsen parked his car near a group of people celebrating a birthday with a picnic Saturday Block Club Chicago reported.

'We need to feel safe where we live': Two Asian women stabbed in downtown San Francisco police say; suspect arrested,Elinor Aspegren,New York Times,2021-05-05,"Authorities arrested a man who they say is suspected of stabbing two Asian women without warning in downtown San Francisco on Tuesday.Officers were sent to 4th and Stockton streets shortly before 5 p.m. and found the wounded women were taken to a hospital, SFPD police spokesman Michael Andraychak said in a statement to USA TODAY.Witnesses told KPIX-TV that a man clutching a knife was walking down Market Street when he approached a bus stop, stabbed the women, and then walked away.54-year-old Patrick Thompson was arrested for the incident after a two-hour search, police told the Associated Press.San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin said on Twitter that his office is ""still receiving the case"" but expects to announce charges against Thompson on Thursday.Neither he nor other authorities indicated whether the women were specifically targeted or whether the attack might be a hate crime.The two women, who are 63 and 84 respectively, remained hospitalized Wednesday.

'Stop killing us': Attacks on Asian Americans highlight rise in hate incidents amid COVID-19,"Yancey-Bragg, N'dea",USA Today,2021-02-12,"A series of violent crimes against Asians and Asian Americans has prompted activists and experts to warn that racist rhetoric about the coronavirus pandemic may be fueling a rise in hate incidents.Police in Oakland, California, announced this week that they arrested a suspect in connection with a brutal attack of a 91-year-old man in Chinatown that was caught on camera. In less than a week, a Thai man was attacked and killed in San Francisco, a Vietnamese woman was assaulted and robbed of $1,000 in San Jose, and a Filipino man was attacked with a box cutter on the subway in New York City.It's unclear whether the crimes were racially motivated, but advocates calling for more to be done to address violence against Asian Americans say racist crimes against the community are historically underreported for a variety of reasons.Meanwhile, police departments across the country are warning residents of increased crime around Lunar New Year, in part because of the threat of robberies during the multi-day celebrations that begin Friday. Cash is a customary gift.Lunar New Year 2021: What does the ox symbolize, and how will it be celebrated during COVID-19 pandemic?Violence against Asian Americans sharply increased in March as COVID-19 began spreading across the country, and some politicians, including former President Donald Trump, blamed China for the pandemic, said Russell Jeung, who created a tool that tracks hate incidents against Asian American Pacific Islander communities called the Stop AAPI Hate tracker.""When President Trump began and insisted on using the term 'China virus,' we saw that hate speech really led to hate violence,"" said Jeung, chair of the Asian American studies department at San Francisco State University. ""That sort of political rhetoric and that sort of anti-Asian climate has continued to this day.""Acts of racist violence lead to increased anxiety and fear in a population that already has higher rates of anxiety and depression related to COVID-19 than other racial groups, Jeung said.Stop AAPI Hate, Jeung's website, which includes a self-reporting tool for harassment, discrimination and violent attacks, recorded 2,808 incidents of anti-Asian discrimination across the U.S. from its inception on March 19 to Dec. 31, 2020. Another organization, Asian Americans Advancing Justice - Asian American Justice Center, recorded more than 3,000 hate incidents in their self-reporting system since late April 2020 – by far the highest number in the tool's four-year history.The FBI collects national hate crime data, but data for 2020 and 2021 has not yet been released. Two hundred sixteen anti-Asian hate crimes were reported in 2019, according to the latest data available.That number may be just a fraction of the true total given that fewer than half of the victims of a hate crime ever report it to the police, according to data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.Jeung said the increase in hate incidents is a particular concern in urban areas. In New York City, police data shows there were 24 anti-Asian hate crimes related to the coronavirus between Jan. 1 and Nov. 29, 2020, compared with just three anti-Asian hate crimes in the same period in 2019.""This increase was cultivated due to the anti-Asian rhetoric about the virus that was publicized, and individuals began to attack Asian New Yorkers, either verbal attack or physical assault,"" Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison told reporters in August.The spike in hate crimes led the NYPD to create an Asian Hate Crimes Task Force.'We just want to be safe': Hate crimes, harassment of Asian Americans rise amid coronavirus pandemicActivists including Amanda Nguyn, co-founder of Rise, a sexual assault survivor advocacy organization, are raising awareness of the Oakland case and the other violent incidents involving Asian Americans. Nguyn said she created an Instagram video about the attacks, which has since gone viral, because she was angered not only by the violence but by the lack of media attention the cases received.""When I made that video I was tired of living in fear and I wanted to scream,"" she told USA TODAY. ""It’s so absurd that I have to say 'Stop killing us.' ... We are literally fearing for our lives as we walk out of our door, and your silence, your silence rings through our heads.""In the Oakland assault, the district attorney's office is investigating whether there is enough evidence to support hate crime charges, Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley said in a statement to USA TODAY.The suspect in the Oakland assault, Yahya Muslim, was charged with three counts of assault, inflicting great bodily injury and committing a crime against an elderly person, O'Malley announced at a news conference Monday.Police said Muslim is believed to have attacked a 60-year-old man and a 55-year-old woman the same day of the Chinatown attack.Meanwhile, actors Daniel Dae Kim and Daniel Wu offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in the case and are donating that money to community organizations like Stop AAPI Hate.""The skyrocketing number of hate crimes against Asian Americans continues to grow, despite our repeated pleas for help,"" they said on Twitter. ""The crimes ignored and even excused.""On Jan. 28, Vicha Ratanapakdee was attacked and later died in San Francisco. Eric Lawson, his son-in-law, told USA TODAY he believes the 84-year-old was targeted because he was Asian. Lawson added that his wife, who is Thai, was verbally assaulted twice and told to ""go back to China"" before the attack.""Everyone is dancing around the issue, and no one's addressing it,"" he said.San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin filed murder and elder abuse charges against Antoine Watson, but his office has ""no evidence of what motivated this senseless attack,"" spokesperson Rachel Marshall told USA TODAY.In San Jose, a 64-year-old Vietnamese woman was assaulted last Wednesday and robbed of $1,000 in cash she had withdrawn for the holiday. No arrest has been made, and there is no indication the robbery was race-related, said public information officer Sgt. Christian Camarillo.That same day in New York, 61-year-old Noel Quintana, who is of reportedly Filipino descent, was slashed in the face with a box cutter on the subway. Spokesperson Detective Sophia Mason told USA TODAY police were investigating but did not answer questions about whether the incident may have been motivated by race.""Although it's unclear whether the particular cases are racially motivated, they are certainly ""related"" and ""horrific,"" Jeung said.""What makes it worse is we see our elderly and youth also targeted,"" he said. ""It seems like people are attacking vulnerable populations.""John C. Yang, president and CEO of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-AAJC said his organization has been tracking anti-Asian hate incidents and crimes for nearly 30 years and has received hundreds more hate incident reports in 2020 than in previous years. He said polls by IPSOS and Pew Research Center indicate that the true scope of hate Asian Americans are experiencing is probably much larger, and better data is needed.""Although these reports are clearly incomplete, clearly just the tip of the iceberg that shows us that there is this dramatic increase in hate incidents,"" he said, noting that it's too soon to tell if that increase is continuing in 2021.There are several reasons victims of a hate crime may not report it to the police, according to Yang.Yang said victims may not be aware of the resources available for them, and there may be language barriers to accessing those resources for older Asian Americans in particular. He said there may be cultural barriers to reporting as well, including shame around being perceived as a victim. Some victims may also be concerned about interacting with law enforcement because of their immigration status.Yang added that not all hate incidents rise to the level of crime, but they still ""clearly inflict a level of mental trauma."" He estimated that only about 10% of the incidents reported to his organization could be considered crimes.Jeung, of Stop AAPI Hate, said that in addition to crimes such as physical violence, Asian Americans have reported experiencing violations of their civil rights including being denied service by businesses or rideshares, being verbally harassed with racial slurs and facing vandalism and property damage.He said his wife was deliberately coughed on while jogging, noting the similarities to a New Jersey incident where a man was charged with making a terroristic threat after coughing on a supermarket employee and saying he had the coronavirus.""There is such a climate of hate and anger that we need to again lower the temperature and remind people to treat others with respect,"" he said.President Joe Biden signed a memorandum in late January denouncing xenophobia and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Yang said the Biden administration's words have made a difference, but the recent violence has caused the community to ""hunker down again"" during a normally celebratory time.He said more needs to be done to ensure victims have support systems and to educate bystanders about safe intervention. He warned against relying too heavily on law enforcement.Despite the horrific crimes, Jeung was excited to see the Oakland community organizing efforts to reduce crime in the neighborhood.""What I'm really heartened by is the Asian American community is really standing up,"" he said. ""I want people to know we're not simply victims of discrimination, but we're advocating for racial justice for everyone in the United States and we'll continue to do so.""",9687
"Hate crimes against Asian Americans are on the rise. Here's what activists, lawmakers, and police are doing to stop the violence.","Tami Abdollah, Trevor Hughes",USA Today,2021-02-27,"DENVER – Helen Oh was walking down the sidewalk of the downtown 16th Street pedestrian mall in April when two young men approached from the other direction.The coronavirus pandemic had been spreading in the United States for a month, and Asian American community groups were warning of a disconcerting surge of hateful and racist language directed toward them, tied to the virus’ origins in China. Oh, an attorney, was on her guard.The two men drew closer.“Infected and disgusting,” one called out as they passed, she said.Heart racing, she ducked into a drugstore.“I didn't think to say anything back when I heard it,"" she said. ""It really only sunk in as I was walking away.""Stepping back onto the street, Oh, 30, walked toward her car as an older couple approached. The woman made a show of detouring around her, she said.“The woman literally walked off the sidewalk to be as far from me as possible,” Oh said. “There was no one else around and it was so obnoxious.”One incident, she might have written off as the kind of casual racism she has encountered all her life as the daughter of Korean immigrants. But two, in such a short time? It was clear, she said, that she was being targeted because she is Asian.“You could feel the sense of hatred and scapegoating that was being built,” Oh said. “I avoided going out by myself for a while.""Asian Americans across the United States are reporting a significant increase in hate crimes, harassment and discrimination tied to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. More than a year after these attacks began, the pandemic has galvanized Asian Americans, many of whom have long felt invisible, to speak out about the hatred and racism being directed their way.Community leaders are calling for greater enforcement of existing hate-crime laws, better connections with local police departments charged with investigating hateful incidents, and other Americans to consider the impact of their words and actions on the country’s estimated 21 million Asian Americans. Asian American entertainers are using their platforms to highlight the issues, Asian American journalists are sharing their own stories of discrimination on social media and a growing chorus of federal lawmakers are demanding action.The pandemic has especially “struck a nerve” for the Asian American community, which has forced many to realize that simple discrimination can turn violent, said Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California, who is a member of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. The fight against the “bamboo ceiling” is now also about physical safety, he said.“For a large number of Asian Americans, especially the young generation, they’re now seeing for the first time actual violence directed at them or their grandparents,” Lieu said. “It’s highly disturbing.”In January, President Joe Biden issued an executive order condemning the attacks – and without naming them, criticizing former President Donald Trump and other federal officials who repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as the “China virus” or the “Kung flu.” The order calls for better data collection about hateful incidents, and mandates federal agencies to fight “racism, xenophobia, and intolerance” directed at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, or AAPI.“The federal government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments through the actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic location of its origin,” Biden said in his order. “Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI persons.”Among recent incidents: In January, an 84-year-old Thai American man was brutally shoved in San Francisco and later died. That same month, police in Oakland, California, said a young man shoved three elderly people to the ground from behind in the city's Chinatown neighborhood, knocking out one. And this week, a 36-year old Asian man in New York’s Chinatown neighborhood was stabbed and taken to a hospital in critical condition. The suspect in that assault faces charges that include attempted murder as a hate crime and assault as a hate crime, among other charges, the New York Police Department said.The surge in hate incidents against the Asian American community since the start of the pandemic was set aflame last winter when Trump began scapegoating Chinese people for the explosion of coronavirus in the United States.“It gave a lot of people permission (to act on) their prejudice,” said Mabel Menard, president of OCA Chicago, a chapter of OCA, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that advocates for civil rights of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.The racism and discrimination accompanying the pandemic comes atop the devastation the disease has had on some portions of the Asian and Pacific Islander community, including health-related business closures and the deaths of at least 67 Filipino registered nurses – a staggering 31% of all nursing deaths, even though Filipinos make up only 4% of registered nurses in the United States, according to National Nurses United. Pacific Islanders rank third in terms of coronavirus deaths, behind Native Americans and Black Americans.More data on Asian hate crimes neededThe San Francisco-based group Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks anti-Asian American and Pacific Islander attacks, and other community groups, such as Asian Americans Advancing Justice, based in Washington, D.C., have collectively recorded more than 3,000 anti-Asian attacks nationwide since March, when the COVID-19 pandemic exploded onto U.S. shores. That’s compared to about 100 such incidents that community trackers have recorded annually in the years prior, said Cynthia Choi, 54, a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate.Because communities of color are often scapegoated during national crises, “we knew it was going to get bad very quickly,” Choi said, “and we wanted to document it in order to understand the severity of it, who was being targeted, where and the magnitude of this problem so we could develop effective responses.”The group tracks reports from 47 states plus the District of Columbia. California accounts for roughly 40% of all incidents, where nearly a third of all Asian Americans live, Choi said. Among cities with large Asian communities, the Bay Area, Los Angeles and New York City have the highest numbers of incidents.Many Asian immigrants who fled to the United States to avoid dictatorship or Communist rule consider the casual racism they encounter to be the price of admission to this country, said Cat Shieh, an anti-hate coordinator with Asian Americans Advancing Justice of Chicago.And while roughly 90% of the incidents don’t rise to the level of criminally prosecutable hate crimes, “they’re dehumanizing,” Choi said.“It’s been a cold, sobering reminder that regardless of your immigration status, how many generations you’ve been here, we continue to have conditional status and to be 'otherized,'” she said.More recently, a series of high-profile incidents captured on video by bystanders helped bring fresh awareness to hateful attacks on Asian Americans, including the 84-year-old Thai American man’s death, which went viral on social media. It spurred the creation of Compassion in Oakland, a group of hundreds of volunteers who now help chaperone elderly Asian American community members on errands.A federal report released last week warned that at least 40% of hate crimes and bias-motivated incidents went unreported to authorities, and that victims commonly said it's a low priority for police to investigate.The report published by the Justice Department’s Hate Crimes Enforcement and Prevention Initiative pointed out that 87% of police agencies participating in the FBI's voluntary Hate Crime Statistics said they had no hate crimes in 2017, even though that's statistically unlikely.The report compared data from a national crime victim survey to federal statistics, highlighting that while there was an average of 204,600 hate crimes experienced by the public, only 7,500 victims were counted by the FBI because the incidents were either not reported to police, not investigated by officers, or not submitted to the national database. The report, based on data from 2009 through 2017, urged law enforcement leaders to emphasize to frontline officers that hate crimes should be taken as seriously as shooting, assaults, rapes, robberies or school violence.Because federal hate-crime data takes time to collect, the FBI has not yet released official statistics about hate-related incidents nationally for 2020. Compounding the difficulty: States often use different criteria to categorize incidents. Federal officials only began tracking hate crimes in the 1990s.Despite the lack of data, some police departments and law enforcement agencies are already responding. The NYPD last year created an Asian hate crimes task force, and Oakland police assigned a new liaison officer to the city’s Chinatown neighborhood. New York state Attorney General Letitia James launched a hotline for victims to report harassment or intimidation, and on Monday, California allocated $1.4 million to track anti-Asian bias and hate crimes through the Stop AAPI Hate tracking group.In Houston, police have seen little evidence of an increase in hate crimes directed at Asian Americans, said Lt. Kevin Gallier, who oversees the hate crimes unit for the country’s fourth-largest city. Gallier said his unit reviews every report taken by an officer where there’s an indication of racial motivations. Police officers, he said, sometimes see “awful but lawful” speech – hate speech isn’t illegal and a racial slur isn’t necessarily a crime unless it causes someone to feel specifically at risk of harm.""Even when it's not welcome speech, you're still able to say what you want in many cases,"" said Gallier, 52. “But thoughts lead to words, and sometimes words lead to actions, and those actions can become criminal.""A long history of racism against AsiansAsian Americans have long faced discrimination and hate crimes in the United States, including the Chinese Exclusion Act, which in 1882 banned Chinese immigrants from entering the country.During World War II, the federal government imprisoned about 120,000 American citizens of Japanese descent solely because of their race, destroying communities across California, Washington and Oregon by forcing business owners to shutter their doors and residents to give up their homes, and locking them up in “relocation centers” in rural areas of Colorado and Wyoming, among others.In addition to federally sanctioned discrimination, the Asian American community has long suffered hate crimes that remain bitterly remembered, including attacks by members of the white supremacist group Order of Caucasians, who murdered four Chinese men – tying them up and dousing them with kerosene to burn them to death – in the early 1800s in Chico, California.More recently, the brutal 1982 baseball-bat murder of Chinese American autoworker Vincent Chin by two white autoworkers in Detroit who were allegedly upset about competition from Japanese automakers prompted the creation of the nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice, which now has chapters nationally.And for years, the stereotype of an Asian carrying cash resulted in Asian Americans being targeted for robberies and carjackings, which by and large aren't categorized as hate crimes despite their racial element, said Debbie Chen, OCA’s executive vice president and a civil engagement programs director for the greater Houston chapter.Myth of 'model minority' harms Asians, othersMany Asian Americans feel their communities have long been ignored by mainstream politics, media and entertainment, especially when coupled with the myth of Asians as a “model minority” who are more successful than Blacks or Latinos.That myth has long been used by white Americans to pit and separate Asian Americans from other people of color, and to justify institutional racism. It may also account for the fact that according to one of the few existing research reports on anti-Asian hate, published this January in the U.S. National Library of Medicine, Asian Americans have a relatively higher chance than Blacks or Latinos of experiencing hate crimes perpetrated by non-white offenders.The report found that despite hate crimes against Asian Americans being on the rise, studies rarely look at such incidents. They are “largely ignored"" by researchers, and as a result the nature and characteristics of the offenders, victims, and situations are largely unknown, the report says.“The outrage, the decrying of these recent incidents, is because of centuries of invisibility, of feeling like the history of anti-Asian racism is not known, that what happens to our community is minimized, is overlooked,” said Choi, of Stop AAPI Hate.Compounding the challenge, the Asian American community is not monolithic. Instead, it’s broad and encompasses people who trace their ancestry from China, Japan, the Philippines, Korea and other countries, all with their own distinct languages and cultures.Shieh, of Asian Americans Advancing Justice of Chicago, said it’s often hard to persuade victims of racial harassment or hate crimes to come to police because they speak a language other than English, or worry about their immigration status. Chicago alone has 19 separate Asian communities.""We're not even a singular group that can unite,” said Shieh, 28. “We forget that our country is not necessarily a black-and-white paradigm or dichotomy.""Chen, of OCA, said Asian immigrants might worry about causing ""trouble.""“They're being targeted as Asians because they (perpetrators) don’t think Asians are going to make as big as a fuss. It goes along with the stereotype that Asians are less likely to be vocal about things,” Chen said. “That’s changing as we have more and more young people growing up here, but so long as your majority of your population is first generation, like Houston’s AAPI majority...they don’t want to cause trouble, they just want to do their job, make a living, make sure their family is OK. They’re just trying to survive.”Lieu said Trump inflamed ’ passions when he wrongfully tied Asians to COVID-19.“It’s going to take education and time to mitigate the harm that was done last year,"" Lieu said, ""It’s not like you can flip a switch and people will stop engaging in discrimination.""Oh, the Denver attorney, said the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated existing racial tensions – and the increasing violence has made it easier to speak up about them.Oh said she became a civil rights attorney in part because she felt Chicago police never took seriously the complaints from her parents that the frequent break-ins and robberies of their small restaurant were driven by the Korean heritage.""Feeling heard has been so powerful for the Asian community,” she said.",15046
"Lawmakers denounce 'crisis point' of anti-Asian violence, call for action to prevent future attacks.",Nicholas Wu,USA Today,2021-02-19,"WASHINGTON – Lawmakers representing groups of minority members of Congress and top House Democratic leaders Friday denounced a ""crisis point"" of attacks against Asian Americans and called for action to prevent future attacks.Speaking at a virtual press conference, Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Chairperson Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., said the Asian American community had ""reached a crisis point that cannot be ignored"" amid reports of a rise in violence and hate incidents against Asian Americans in the last several weeks.Chu and other lawmakers said the attacks are part of a rise in anti-Asian American bias and xenophobia amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Stop AAPI Hate, a group tracking anti-Asian discrimination, said it had received more than 2,808 firsthand accounts of anti-Asian hate from mid-March 2020 through the end of 2020.Many of the lawmakers speaking Friday laid the blame at the feet of leaders like former President Donald Trump, who has blamed China for the pandemic and used derisive terms for the coronavirus. Advocates and Asian American lawmakers warned the language would inflame anti-Asian American sentiment.""What started as dirty looks and verbal assaults"" at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic had ""escalated to physical attacks and violence against innocent Asian Americans,"" Chu said. ""Just as many Asian Americans were preparing for the Lunar New Year over the past few weeks, we saw a surge in anti-Asian violence.""Chu cited several attacks against Asian Americans, including the killing of 84-year-old Thai American Vicha Ratanapakdee, and a recent increase in violence against senior citizens in Oakland, Calif.'s, Chinatown.In response, Chu and the lawmakers called for Congress to take action to pass the ""No Hate Act,"" which would provide grants to states to improve hate crime reporting. Chu said they would also be requesting a meeting with the Department of Justice to follow up on the implementation of President Joe Biden's executive order addressing xenophobia and violence against Asian Americans.Chu hoped it would be a bipartisan request to the Department as they sought more details on enforcement actions and ""proactive actions"" to reach out to Asian American communities.Rep. Andy Kim, D-N.J., said Trump's rhetoric was not the only factor in the increase in violence.""There's a deeper level of bias and discrimination that is harbored within our country,"" he said. Kim said images like that of a 91-year-old shoved to the ground in Oakland Chinatown had been ""seared"" into his memory.""That could have been my father or grandfather,"" he said.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., gave brief remarks calling for the need to improve hate crime reporting, citing a recent incident in New York where a 52-year-old woman waiting in line at a bakery had been shoved into a metal newspaper box by a man, but it could not be determined whether the incident was a hate crime.Asian American lawmakers noted the language barrier among immigrants could make it difficult for crimes to be reported. Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., noted she had talked to people about incidents that could be classified as hate incidents, but the victims had limited English capabilities and ""they don't necessarily know what some has been saying.""Other lawmakers from what is known as the ""Tri-Caucus,"" or the group of three caucuses in Congress representing lawmakers of Asian, Black, and Hispanic descent or those with shared interests, stressed the need for solidarity.Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., who represents part of Los Angeles including its Chinatown, read aloud an email from an Asian American constituent who had recently been robbed during the Lunar New Year, and said ""what happens to anybody in our community happens to the rest of us.""And Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., a former chairwoman of the Black Caucus, called for concrete actions, telling reporters, ""as an African American woman, this is an issue that we know so well in the Black community. It's an issue we cannot just turn our back to and just say ... we stand in support.""

The TV personality has 2.4 million followers on Instagram, 632,000 subscribers to her YouTube channel ""Hello Hunnay with Jeannie Mai"" and nearly 260,000 followers on Twitter.People may be following her for her outfits or YouTube content, but they'll also be getting a dose of hard news.""This is something that should be everybody's business,"" Mai says.Other celebrities are raising awareness, too.Earlier this month, actors Daniel Dae Kim and Daniel Wu offered a $25,000 reward for information that ultimately led to an arrest in the case of an Oakland assault.Mai is proud of her ""Asian brothers and sisters"" for making their voices heard.She emphasizes that racism doesn't just impact the Asian community, but Asians should be included in conversations about curbing racist behaviors.""For everybody, not just the Asian community, racism and hate are pandemics that we have to fight to eradicate,"" she says. ""But it starts with listening to our communities of color, planning and organizing to support, speaking out about the problems and being active about the solution. You can't stand for (Black Lives Matter), and then sit there sedentary about Asian attacks.""Important: Here's why 'Minari' is truly an American story, even if the Golden Globes disagreeShe doesn't think white Americans are educated enough about Asian history or culture – but she doesn't think she's educated enough about Black history or culture either.""I don't think our school system is catered around educating us what we really need to know,"" she says.She does, however, believe that racism can be unlearned. ""I believe racism is taught,"" she says. ""And it may not be your parents sitting you down telling you specifically like, 'Don't trust those Asians. Don't be friends with Black people.' No, I think it's in every grain of your upbringing.""Mai's parents immigrated to the U.S. from Vietnam and escaped communism to come to a safer place.""I've always been taught to just stay quiet, don't be the one to cause issues,"" she says.She wants her community to know that they have a voice and need to protect one another, even if they don't speak each other's languages. Beyond that, they should stand up for all their neighbors, too.Mai is pleased that more Asian Americans have been appearing on television in series like ""Bling Empire"" on Netflix and ""House of Ho"" on HBO Max. But she also wants to see programming that breaks away from the plot points that fueled the mega hit movie ""Crazy Rich Asians.""""Hollywood has this way of taking a stereotype and then marketing it down to the ground,"" she says. ""I would just hope to see also a diverse depiction of what Asian Americans can look like, because not all of them are crazy or rich.""

"Hate crime charges in stabbing, teen harassed: New York City anti-Asian incidents highlight rise in hate","Yancey-Bragg, N'dea; Chao, Mary",USA Today,2021-02-26,"BERGEN COUNTY, N.J. - Yena Choe, 16, was at Times Square on Saturday with six friends to film a video for the Korean-American Association of New Jersey's ""Samiljeol"" event, a remembrance of Korean resistance to Japanese rule.As they walked with Korean flags, an unmasked, middle-aged woman glared at the teens and told them, ""Get away from me. Stay far away from me,"" while waving her hands, Choe said.""We did nothing to provoke this woman,"" said the Leonia High School sophomore, who said she and her friends were all wearing double face masks. ""Yet based on our appearance, and quite possibly even based on the flags flying in our hands, we were treated as if we were a contagious disease.""For the rest of the day, I was afraid,"" she said. ""I was afraid that something like that could happen again, that next time it could be worse than a glare and a rude remark.""Days later in the city's Chinatown, Salman Muflihi was arrested after allegedly stabbing a 36-year-old Asian man, police said. Muflihi is facing charges of attempted murder as a hate crime, assault as a hate crime, forgery and criminal possession of a weapon, according to New York Police Department statements to USA TODAY on Friday.The incident is a part of a series of recent violent crimes against Asians and Asian Americans in New York and across the country.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and the commander of the police department's Asian Hate Crime Task Force spoke at a news conference Tuesday about what the city is doing to prevent anti-Asian hate crimes.""An attack on Asian New Yorkers is an attack on all of us,"" de Blasio said.Last year, there were 28 incidents of COVID-19 related hate crimes against Asians in New York and two so far in 2021, according to Deputy Inspector of the city's Anti-Asian Hate Crimes Task Force Stewart Loo.A string of high-profile attacks on Asian Americans are surfacing from coast to coast a year into the pandemic. In January, an 84-year-old San Francisco immigrant from Thailand died after he was shoved to the ground on his morning walk. In February, a Vietnamese woman was assaulted and robbed of $1,000 in San Jose and a Filipino man was slashed with a box cutter on the subway in New York City.The head of Oakland's Chinatown Chamber of Commerce has collected more than 20 incident reports and videos of small businesses getting robbed and owners and customers assaulted, he told San Francisco's KGO-TV.Attacks like these have continued despite President Biden's executive order banning the federal government from using racist language to discuss the pandemic, a turnaround from months of his predecessor mocking the ""China virus"" and ""kung flu.""Around the world, as coronavirus has devastated the economy, Asians have become targeted for the pandemic that started in Wuhan, China. They have been yelled at, spat on and beaten up, according to media reports across the globe.Perpetual foreignerIn Wyckoff, New Jersey, last June, a Chinese restaurant was vandalized with the words ""coronavirus"" and ""go home"" spray-painted on the windows and sidewalk.North Jersey is home to one of the state's largest populations of Asian Americans with 17% of Bergen County identifying as Asian. In towns such as Leonia and Fort Lee, Asian Americans make up about 40% of the community.There were 47 race-based incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in New Jersey from March 19 through Dec. 31, the eighth most of any state, according to the advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate. Of the cases, 64% were verbal attacks while 13% were physical assaults. In New York City, 259 incidents were recorded against Asian Americans in the same period with 81% being verbal and 12% physical.Burdened by the model minority myth, Asians are easy targets in times of downturn, said Russell Jeung, co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate and professor at San Francisco State University. Despite their deep roots in the U.S. Asian Americans will forever be considered foreigners by some people, he said, a stereotype that has persisted since the first immigration of Asians in the 19th century to help build the Transcontinental Railroad.""Since we don't belong, we can be spat on,"" Jeung said.U.S. Rep. Andy Kim, who represents New Jersey's Third District, says the hate crimes seen over the past weeks are reprehensible.""Seeing our elders targeted and attacked has been hard to watch and difficult to explain to my two boys,"" said Kim, whose sons are 3 and 5. ""New Jersey has been a place where generations of Asian immigrants have found open arms and incredible opportunities.""We cannot put an end to this hate until we see tangible results at all levels of government and society,"" Kim said. He called for executive actions from the administration and legislation from Congress.Asian community activists in New Jersey are aware of the rise in hate crimes. While they are vigilant and cautious, they feel the Garden State is a welcoming place for immigrants.""We are in a much better situation than in New York City,"" said Michelle Song, executive vice president of the Korean-American Association, who lives in Somerset. New Jersey values diversity, said Song, who emigrated from South Korea in 1995. It's also a suburban environment where automobiles are the main mode of transportation, she said, leaving fewer chances for random encounters that can flare into harassment.""We hardly walk here, we don't see people face to face,"" added Kirby Tan, a Chinese community group organizer who lives in Tenafly.Tan has lived in New Jersey for 35 years. After arriving from Malaysia to study in San Diego at a time when there were few Asians, he recalls developing a buddy system for safety when he went outside. His neighborhood in Tenafly is populated with many Asian American families and there is a sense of community, Tan said.A history of outcastsAs businesses have shut down, Asians have become a convenient scapegoat for troubles. It has happened before: Consider the 1982 case of Chinese American Vincent Chin, who was beaten to death by two autoworkers who were frustrated at losing jobs because of competition from Japanese car manufacturers. Following a plea bargain, the men received no jail time. “These weren’t the kind of men you send to jail,” wrote Michigan Judge Charles Kaufman.This month, Congress' Asian Pacific American Caucus held a day of remembrance on the 79th anniversary of President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordering more than 100,000 Japanese Americans into internment camps during World War II, another dark period in this country’s history.Meanwhile, the young American-born sons of Japanese immigrants – known as Nisei –were eager to show their patriotism and shed racist stereotypes. They volunteered to serve in the military during the war. But again, the government distrusted them, so they weren’t allowed to serve in the Pacific. The estimated 33,000 Japanese American soldiers were sent to serve in Europe to fight for the U.S., even as many of their families were held in internment camps.The Nisei soldiers became known for their bravery. The 100th/442nd Infantry Regiment was comprised almost entirely of second-generation Japanese Americans, and they became the most decorated unit of its size in U.S. military history.Choe is well aware that while born in this country, she is still sometimes perceived as an outsider.""As angry as I was, I was hesitant to respond,"" she said of the Times Square incident. ""The videos and images of violent anti-Asian hate crimes that I had seen on the news and on social media rushed through my head, making me feel almost embarrassed, almost scared to hold the flag of my own ancestors.""Choe blames social media and comments from elected officials, including former President Donald Trump, who seemed to direct responsibility for the global pandemic toward Asians.""Looking back, I wish I would have said something,"" Choe said. “I wish I didn’t have to feel scared about standing up for myself. But this is the sad reality of the injustices that continuously face Asian Americans in our society.""",8049
"COVID fallout: Biden wants to stop, not stoke, racism against Asian Americans like me",Thomas K. Lew,USA Today,2021-02-17,"As an Asian American growing up in the United States, I experienced frequent insensitive racial questions: Do you know kung fu? Why are your eyes like that? Where are you really from?Now as an adult, I often receive outright racist remarks. For example, recently in my capacity as a practicing physician treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients, I advocated for continued mask usage until a majority of our fellow Americans are vaccinated. I received some vicious feedback: Go back to Wuhan. Stop being George Soros’ patsy. Shut up and let the real Americans talk.None of this of course makes any sense — I was born in the United States and my family is from a region of China over 600 miles away from Wuhan. This pandemic has led to more racism. I was thus pleasantly surprised and excited that in their first few weeks, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have strongly denounced the ongoing violence and hate crimes against Asian Americans and other minority groups.Hate crimes grew during pandemicThe pair deserve praise for showing national leadership against this discrimination. Biden recently signed an executive memorandum condemning “racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian American and Pacific Islander” communities, and Biden and Harris released videos this month on the Lunar New Year to further bring attention to these issues. This is in the context of increasing violence and hate crimes against Asian-Americans across the nation during the pandemic.For example, earlier this year, a 91-year-old Asian man in a California Chinatown was brutally attacked, while another elderly man was attacked with a box cutter in New York. Stop AAPI Hate, a website that aggregates reported incidents of hate crimes against Asian Americans, reports significant increases in the last 11 months, to nearly 3,000 separate events.The hate often is linked to individuals blaming China for creating the coronavirus pandemic, and that animosity spills into anyone who looks to be of Asian descent, whether they are American citizens or not. National leadership and rhetoric are vital to combatting this, and the current administration should be applauded for taking this head-on.America can help: Biden needs to mobilize the global community to produce the COVID-19 vaccine.In addition to continuing to publicly and specifically identify the increase in hate crimes, Biden has signed four related executive orders related to tackling the issue. This has brought awareness to a minority group whose inequities are often overlooked and swept away with the label of the “model minority.”'A stain on our national character'Contrast this to the previous administration which actively stoked aggression against Asian groups. Former President Donald Trump and his staff repeatedly called the coronavirus the “Kung Flu” and the “Chinese virus.” The World Health Organization has called such geographical labeling discriminatory, and public health experts have said it perpetuates xenophobia. It also allows people an innocent scapegoat against which to funnel their coronavirus fears and agitation. Words matter. None more so than those used by the leaders of the free world.In his Lunar New Year video, Biden called racism, harassment and hate crimes “simply wrong — it’s a stain on our national character.” We are currently going through a reckoning against racial discrimination, highlighted by the Black Lives Matter movement. Whether it’s asking young Asian-Americans about their “kung fu” or beating elderly Asian-Americans over the “kung flu,” we need to continue bringing attention to racism against all minority groups, so we can recognize and extinguish it. Thank you, President Biden and Vice President Harris, for taking another step forward to achieve this goal.Thomas K.
